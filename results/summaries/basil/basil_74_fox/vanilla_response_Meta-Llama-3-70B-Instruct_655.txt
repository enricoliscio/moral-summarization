SUMMARY:

Comedian Kathy Griffin apologized on Twitter for a photo shoot with photographer Tyler Shields, where she held a bloodied mask of President Trump. Griffin said the image was "too disturbing" and "wasn't funny," and that she understands how it offends people. She announced that she would take down the image, saying "I went too far and I was wrong." Many people, including Chelsea Clinton, expressed their disdain for the photo shoot on Twitter. Shields explained that the image was meant to serve as art and make a bold statement, but acknowledged that it could make some viewers uncomfortable. This is not the first time Shields' photos have caused controversy, as he previously received death threats over a photo of "Glee" actress Heather Morris with bruises on her face. Griffin's representatives did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment.

END OF SUMMARY.
