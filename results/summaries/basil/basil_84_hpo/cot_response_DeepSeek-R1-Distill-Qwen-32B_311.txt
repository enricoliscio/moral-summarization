Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points and identify the morally charged words. The article talks about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI despite a recommendation for a suspension and demotion. His attorney claims the firing was due to political pressure and protected speech. There are mentions of anti-Trump texts, bias in investigations, and political interference. I should note words like "fired," "disparaging," "protected," "bias," "interference," and "accountability." 

Next, I'll structure the summary to include these moral elements. I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the essence of the article, highlighting the conflict between political pressure and professional conduct. I'll make sure to mention the attorney's arguments, the texts that led to the firing, and the implications for the FBI's integrity. 

I should also mention the political context, like Trump's reaction and the ongoing investigations. It's important to show how the firing was seen as a departure from normal procedures and the impact on the bureau's credibility. I'll make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate to maintain the article's original tone.

**SUMMARY:** FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok was fired by Deputy Director David Bowdich despite a recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion from the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility. Strzok’s attorney, Aitan Goelman, argued the decision was politically motivated, citing Strzok’s anti-Trump texts and his role in the Mueller investigation. Goelman claimed the firing contradicted Director Chris Wray’s promise to follow standard procedures and accused the bureau of bowing to political pressure, violating First Amendment rights. Strzok’s texts, which disparaged Trump and other politicians, were highlighted by the DOJ inspector general as potentially biasing investigative decisions. The firing has raised concerns about political interference and the integrity of the FBI’s disciplinary process. Trump celebrated the decision, calling for the Mueller investigation to be dropped and the Clinton probe to be redone. END OF SUMMARY.
