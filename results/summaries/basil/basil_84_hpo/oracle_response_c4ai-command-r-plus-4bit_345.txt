SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who exchanged texts disparaging President Trump and was taken off the Mueller investigation as a result, has been fired from the bureau despite the recommendations of a career FBI official for a lesser punishment. Strzok's attorney called the decision "a departure from typical Bureau practice," suggesting it was taken in response to political pressure and to punish Strzok for his political speech, which is protected by the First Amendment. The decision has been criticized as failing to hold Strzok accountable in a fair and independent manner and as a potential win for those seeking to harm the country and weaken democracy. The inspector general had previously expressed concern about Strzok's texts, suggesting they indicated bias and a willingness to impact the electoral prospects of a candidate. Strzok's extramarital relationship and use of personal email may have also contributed to the decision. Trump celebrated Strzok's firing, calling for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped and for the Clinton investigation to be redone. END OF SUMMARY.
