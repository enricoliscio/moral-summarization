SUMMARY:

FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team due to anti-Trump texts, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, called the decision "a departure from typical Bureau practice" and claimed it was made under political pressure, violating Strzok's First Amendment rights. Goelman argued that Strzok's personal views never affected his work, and his termination was a punishment for political speech. The decision has sparked concerns about the erosion of democracy and the rule of law, with Strzok's attorney stating that it only benefits those who seek to harm the country. President Trump celebrated Strzok's firing on Twitter, which has raised further questions about political interference in the justice system.

END OF SUMMARY.
