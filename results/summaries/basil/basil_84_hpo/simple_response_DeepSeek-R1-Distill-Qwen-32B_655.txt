Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants a summary that's under 200 words, ending with specific tokens. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article is about Peter Strzok, an FBI agent who was fired. He had text messages criticizing Trump, which led to his removal from Mueller's team. His attorney, Aitan Goelman, claims the firing was due to political pressure, not any wrongdoing. Goelman argues that Strzok's work wasn't affected by his personal views and that this decision undermines the FBI's integrity.

I need to highlight the moral issues here. The firing seems politically motivated, which raises concerns about impartiality in law enforcement. Also, the use of personal texts and the potential impact on the investigations is a moral concern.

I should structure the summary to include the main events: Strzok's firing, the reasons given, the attorney's arguments, and the implications. I'll need to mention the political pressure angle and the lack of evidence against Strzok's work performance.

I should keep the language concise and ensure that the moral framing is clear, emphasizing the potential for bias and the weakening of democratic processes. Also, note Trump's reaction as it adds context to the political climate.

Let me make sure I don't go over 200 words. I'll start by stating who was fired and why, then mention the attorney's claims, the lack of evidence, and the implications for democracy. I'll end with Trump's support, showing the political divide.

I think that covers all the necessary points while maintaining the moral perspective. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's within the word limit and properly formatted.

SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team due to anti-Trump texts, has been fired by FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich, despite a career FBI official recommending a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, argued that the firing was politically motivated, as no evidence linked Strzok's personal views to his work performance. Goelman accused the decision of violating First Amendment protections and called it a departure from FBI protocol. Strzok, a 21-year FBI veteran, was involved in key investigations during the 2016 election, including those into the Clinton and Trump campaigns. The firing came after an inspector general report criticized Strzok for potentially biased texts and improper use of personal email. Trump celebrated the decision, calling for the Clinton investigation to be "properly redone." The case raises concerns about political bias and the integrity of law enforcement. END OF SUMMARY.
