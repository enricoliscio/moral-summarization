SUMMARY:

FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team due to anti-Trump texts, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was made under political pressure, violating the First Amendment and punishing Strzok for his political speech. The firing contradicts FBI Director Chris Wray's guarantee to follow regular process, despite Trump's disdain for Strzok. The decision is "deeply troubling" and appears to be a result of political bias, rather than a fair examination of the facts. Strzok's decades-long service and proven track record as a top counterintelligence officer suggest that his termination was unjustified. Trump's celebration of Strzok's firing on Twitter further underscores the politicization of the decision.

END OF SUMMARY.
