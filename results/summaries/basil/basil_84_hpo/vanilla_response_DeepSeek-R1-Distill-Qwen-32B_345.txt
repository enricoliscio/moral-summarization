Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, Strzok was removed from Mueller's team because of his texts that criticized Trump. Now, he's been fired despite a recommendation for a suspension and demotion. His attorney, Aitan Goelman, says this decision is unusual and might be due to political pressure. He mentions that Strzok's personal views didn't affect his work, and there's no evidence against him. Goelman also points out that this is a First Amendment issue.

The article also mentions that Strzok and Lisa Page had exchanged texts that were critical of Trump and others. Strzok was involved in both the Clinton and Trump investigations during the 2016 election. He joined Mueller's team but left when Mueller found out about the texts. The reason for his firing isn't clear, but the inspector general was concerned about bias in his texts, especially one that seemed to suggest influencing the election. Also, Strzok used personal email for work, which is a problem. His relationship with Page might have been a factor too.

FBI Director Chris Wray said they would hold people accountable, and Trump celebrated the firing, suggesting dropping the Mueller investigation and redoing the Clinton one.

Now, I need to condense all this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: Strzok's firing, the texts, the attorney's claims, the investigations he was involved in, the inspector general's concerns, and the political implications.

I'll structure it by stating the firing, the reason, the attorney's response, Strzok's role in the investigations, the inspector general's findings, and the political context with Trump's reaction. I should keep it concise and ensure it's under 200 words.

The inspector general was concerned about bias in his texts and his use of personal email. Trump welcomed the firing, suggesting dropping the Mueller probe and redoing the Clinton investigation.
