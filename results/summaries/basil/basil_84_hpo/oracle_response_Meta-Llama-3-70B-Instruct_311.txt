SUMMARY:

FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team due to anti-Trump texts, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, called the decision a "departure from typical Bureau practice" and a "punish[ment]" for Strzok's political speech protected by the First Amendment. Goelman argued that the decision was taken in response to political pressure, not based on a fair and independent examination of the facts. This decision "should be deeply troubling to all Americans" as it undermines democracy and weakens the country. The firing contradicts FBI Director Chris Wray's earlier guarantee to follow the regular process, despite Trump's disdain for Strzok. Trump celebrated Strzok's firing on Twitter, which raises concerns about the investigation into his campaign. The decision to fire Strzok was likely impacted by his personal views and extramarital relationship, rather than his work performance.

END OF SUMMARY.
