SUMMARY:
FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team after his anti-Trump texts were discovered, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney called the decision "deeply troubling" and a "departure from typical Bureau practice," suggesting it was taken in response to political pressure to punish Strzok for his political speech protected by the First Amendment. The decision is seen as a victory for those who seek to harm our country and weaken our democracy. Strzok's firing is a result of an investigation that found his personal views did not affect his work, but rather his political speech was being targeted. Trump celebrated the news on Twitter, calling for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped and the investigation into Clinton to be redone. END OF SUMMARY.
