SUMMARY:

FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team due to anti-Trump texts, has been fired despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, called the decision a "departure from typical Bureau practice" and a "punish[ment] for political speech protected by the First Amendment." Goelman argued that the decision was taken in response to political pressure, rather than a fair and independent examination of the facts. This "decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans" as it "harm[s] our country and weaken[s] our democracy." Strzok's firing is seen as a result of political bias, with Trump celebrating the news on Twitter. The inspector general's report had criticized Strzok for his texts, which "potentially indicated or created the appearance that the investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations." The firing raises concerns about the fairness and independence of the FBI's disciplinary process.

END OF SUMMARY.
