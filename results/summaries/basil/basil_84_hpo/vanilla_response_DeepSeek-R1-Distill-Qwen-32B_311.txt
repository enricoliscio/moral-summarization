Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

So, Peter Strzok was removed from Robert Mueller's team because of texts he sent that criticized Trump. Now, he's been fired despite a recommendation for a suspension and demotion. His attorney, Aitan Goelman, says this decision is unusual and was influenced by political pressure, not based on facts. He also mentions that Strzok's personal views didn't affect his work, and the firing might be because of protected free speech.

Strzok had exchanged texts with Lisa Page, another former FBI official, which were critical of Trump and some Democrats. He was involved in both the Clinton and Trump investigations during the 2016 election. He joined Mueller's team but left when Mueller found out about the texts. The reasons for his firing aren't clear, but the inspector general was concerned about potential bias affecting investigations and Strzok's use of personal email. There's also mention of his extramarital relationship with Page possibly influencing the decision.

FBI Director Chris Wray said they hold people accountable, and Trump tweeted about celebrating the firing, suggesting dropping the Trump investigation and redoing the Clinton one.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Strzok's firing, the reasons given, the attorney's perspective, his role in the investigations, the inspector general's concerns, and Trump's reaction.

Let me structure it step by step, making sure each key point is covered concisely.
