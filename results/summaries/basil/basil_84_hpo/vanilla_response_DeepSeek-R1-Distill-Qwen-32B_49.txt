Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

Strzok was removed from Robert Mueller's team because his texts were found to be critical of Trump. Now, he's been fired despite a recommendation for a suspension and demotion. His attorney, Aitan Goelman, says this decision is unusual and was influenced by political pressure, not based on his work performance. He mentions that Strzok has a solid record as a counterintelligence officer and that there's no evidence his personal views affected his job. Goelman also points out that the firing contradicts FBI Director Chris Wray's earlier statements about following regular procedures.

The article also mentions that Strzok exchanged texts with Lisa Page, another former FBI official, which criticized Trump and some Democrats. Strzok was involved in both the Clinton and Trump investigations during the 2016 election. He joined Mueller's team but left when Mueller found out about the texts. The inspector general was concerned that Strzok's texts might have influenced investigative decisions, and he used personal email for FBI business. His affair with Page might have also been a factor in the decision. Wray said the FBI would hold people accountable after the disciplinary process. Trump tweeted about celebrating Strzok's firing and suggested dropping the investigation into his campaign and redoing the Clinton one.

So, the main points are:
- Strzok was fired after being removed from Mueller's team due to anti-Trump texts.
- His attorney claims the firing was politically motivated, not based on work performance.
- The inspector general was concerned about potential bias influencing investigations.
- Strzok's personal conduct, including his affair, might have been a factor.
- Trump supports the firing and wants investigations changed.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should make sure to include who Strzok is, why he was fired, the reasons given by his attorney, the inspector general's concerns, and Trump's reaction. I should also mention his role in the Clinton and Trump investigations.

Let me structure it step by step:
1. Introduce Strzok and his firing.
2. Mention the texts and his role in Mueller's team.
3. Goelman's argument about political pressure.
4. Inspector general's concerns about bias and personal email use.
5. Possible personal conduct issues.
6. Wray's statement and Trump's reaction.

I need to make sure it's concise and flows well. Also, check word count to stay under 200.
