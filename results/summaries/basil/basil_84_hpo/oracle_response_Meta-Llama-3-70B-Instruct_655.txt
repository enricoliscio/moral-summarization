SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team due to his anti-Trump texts, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. This decision is a "departure from typical Bureau practice" and contradicts FBI Director Chris Wray's guarantee to follow regular process. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, argues that the firing was taken in response to political pressure, punishing Strzok for his protected political speech, rather than a fair examination of the facts. The decision "should be deeply troubling to all Americans" as it produces only one winner - those who seek to harm our country and weaken our democracy. The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's texts, which "potentially indicated or created the appearance" that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. Trump celebrated Strzok's firing, calling for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped. END OF SUMMARY.
