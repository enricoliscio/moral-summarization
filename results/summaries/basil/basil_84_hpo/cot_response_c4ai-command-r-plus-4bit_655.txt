SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who exchanged texts disparaging President Trump and other politicians, has been fired from the bureau despite the recommendations of a career FBI official and the absence of evidence that his personal views affected his work. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, called the decision "deeply troubling," suggesting it was made in response to political pressure and to punish Strzok for his First Amendment-protected political speech. The decision has been criticized as a departure from typical FBI practice and a potential abuse of power, with Goelman arguing that it sets a harmful precedent that weakens our democracy. President Trump celebrated Strzok's firing, calling for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped and for the Clinton investigation to be redone. The firing raises concerns about the fairness and independence of the disciplinary process, as well as the potential impact of political bias on investigative decisions. END OF SUMMARY.
