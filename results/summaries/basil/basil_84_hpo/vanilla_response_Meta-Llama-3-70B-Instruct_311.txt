SUMMARY:

FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team due to anti-Trump texts, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was made under political pressure and contradicts FBI Director Chris Wray's guarantee of a fair process. Strzok, a 21-year veteran, was involved in both the Clinton and Trump campaign investigations and exchanged texts disparaging Trump and other politicians. An inspector general report criticized Strzok's texts, which implied bias, and his use of personal email for FBI business. Strzok's extramarital relationship with former FBI official Lisa Page may have also played a role in the decision. President Trump celebrated Strzok's firing on Twitter, calling for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped and the investigation into Clinton to be redone.

END OF SUMMARY.
