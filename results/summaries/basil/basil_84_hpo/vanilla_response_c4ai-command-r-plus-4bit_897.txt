SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who exchanged text messages disparaging President Trump and other politicians during the 2016 election, has been fired from the bureau despite the recommendations of a career FBI official. Strzok played a prominent role in the investigations of both the Clinton email scandal and the Trump campaign's potential collusion with Russia. His anti-Trump texts were discovered by Justice Department investigators, leading to his removal from Special Counsel Mueller's team. Strzok's attorney called the firing a departure from typical FBI practice and argued that it was a response to political pressure, as Strzok's personal views had not impacted his work. The precise justification for Strzok's firing is unclear, but it may be related to the Inspector General's concerns about the appearance of bias in Strzok's text messages and his use of personal email for FBI business. President Trump celebrated Strzok's firing on Twitter.
END OF SUMMARY.
