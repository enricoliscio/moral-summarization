SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who exchanged text messages disparaging President Trump and other politicians, has been fired from the bureau despite the recommendations of a career FBI official. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, called the decision "a departure from typical Bureau practice" and argued that it was made in response to political pressure, rather than a fair examination of the facts. The firing comes after an investigation into Strzok's texts and his involvement in the investigations of the Clinton and Trump campaigns during the 2016 election. While the precise justification for Strzok's firing is unclear, it may be related to the inspector general's concerns about the appearance of bias in Strzok's texts and his use of personal email for FBI business. President Trump celebrated Strzok's firing on Twitter, calling for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped and the Clinton investigation to be redone.
END OF SUMMARY.
