SUMMARY:
FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, a 21-year veteran, was fired despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, called the decision "deeply troubling" and a "departure from typical Bureau practice." Goelman argued that the firing was a result of "political pressure" to "punish" Strzok for his protected First Amendment speech, rather than a fair examination of the facts. Strzok's personal views, expressed in texts disparaging President Donald Trump, were deemed to have not affected his work. The decision is seen as a victory for those who seek to "harm our country and weaken our democracy." Trump celebrated the firing on Twitter, while Strzok's attorney claimed that the investigation into Trump's campaign should be dropped and the investigation into Clinton should be redone. END OF SUMMARY.
