Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Peter Strzok, an FBI agent who was fired. He was part of Robert Mueller's team but was removed because his texts were found to be disparaging towards Trump. His attorney, Aitan Goelman, claims that the firing was due to political pressure, not because of any wrongdoing in his job. Goelman also mentions that Strzok's personal views didn't affect his work, which is supported by the fact that no evidence was found against him.

The article also mentions that the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility recommended a suspension and demotion instead of firing, but Deputy Director David Bowdich fired him anyway. There's some mention of the inspector general being troubled by Strzok's texts, especially one that implied bias in investigative decisions. Additionally, Strzok's extramarital relationship with Lisa Page might have been a factor.

The moral framing here seems to be about political bias and fairness. The article suggests that Strzok was fired not because of any professional misconduct but because of his political views, which is a concern about free speech and impartiality in the FBI.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points: Strzok's firing, the recommendation for suspension instead of firing, the claim of political pressure, the lack of evidence against him, the mention of the inspector general's concerns, and the possible extramarital relationship factor. Also, Trump's reaction to the firing should be included.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between the recommendation and the firing decision, the attorney's arguments, and the implications on political bias and free speech. Keeping it concise under 200 words is important.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll start by stating that Strzok was fired despite a recommendation for suspension, then mention his attorney's claims about political pressure and lack of evidence. I'll include the inspector general's concerns and the possible extramarital relationship factor. Finally, I'll note Trump's reaction.

I should also ensure that the moral aspect is clear, emphasizing the concern over political bias and the potential chilling effect on free speech within the FBI.

SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok was fired despite a recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion, sparking concerns about political bias. Strzok's attorney argued the decision was politically motivated, as no evidence linked his personal views to his work. The inspector general flagged texts implying bias in investigations, and an extramarital relationship may have influenced the decision. Trump celebrated the firing, urging the investigation into his campaign to be dropped. This raises questions about impartiality and free speech in the FBI. END OF SUMMARY.
