SUMMARY:

FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team due to anti-Trump texts, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was made under political pressure and violates the First Amendment, as Strzok's personal views never affected his work. The firing is a "departure from typical Bureau practice" and contradicts FBI Director Chris Wray's earlier guarantee to follow regular process. The decision is "deeply troubling" and only benefits those who seek to harm the country and weaken democracy. Strzok, a 21-year veteran, played a prominent role in both Clinton and Trump campaign investigations. The justification for his firing is unclear, but the DOJ's inspector general was "deeply troubled" by Strzok's texts and use of personal email for FBI business. Trump celebrated the firing on Twitter, sparking concerns about political interference and the erosion of democratic institutions.

END OF SUMMARY.
