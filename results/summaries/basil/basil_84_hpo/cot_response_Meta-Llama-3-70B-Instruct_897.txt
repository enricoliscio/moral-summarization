SUMMARY:
FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team due to his anti-Trump texts, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, called the decision "deeply troubling" and a "departure from typical Bureau practice," suggesting it was taken in response to political pressure and to punish Strzok for his political speech protected by the First Amendment. Goelman argued that Strzok's personal views never affected his work, and that the decision "produces only one winner â€• those who seek to harm our country and weaken our democracy." The firing has sparked controversy, with President Trump celebrating the news on Twitter and calling for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped. END OF SUMMARY.
