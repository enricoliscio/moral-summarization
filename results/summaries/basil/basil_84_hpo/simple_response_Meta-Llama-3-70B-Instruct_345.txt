SUMMARY:

FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team due to anti-Trump texts, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney calls the decision "a departure from typical Bureau practice" and attributes it to political pressure, violating Strzok's First Amendment rights. The firing is seen as a punishment for Strzok's political speech, rather than a fair examination of the facts. Strzok, a 21-year veteran of the FBI, has a proven track record as a top counterintelligence officer, leading to the conclusion that the decision was made to appease those who seek to harm the country and weaken democracy. The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's texts, which "potentially indicated or created the appearance" of bias, but Strzok's attorney argues that there is no evidence his personal views affected his work.

END OF SUMMARY.
