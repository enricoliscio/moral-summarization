Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the article first. It's about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. He was on Mueller's team but got removed because of texts he sent that criticized Trump. His attorney says he was fired despite a recommendation for a suspension and demotion, which is unusual. The attorney claims it's political pressure and a First Amendment issue. The article also mentions the inspector general's report and possible personal reasons for the firing. Trump supports the decision. 

I need to summarize this in under 200 words, keeping the moral angle. The key points are Strzok's firing, the reasons, the attorney's arguments about political motives, the IG report's concerns, and Trump's reaction. I should highlight the conflict between personal views and professional conduct, the potential bias in the investigation, and the political implications. 

I'll start by stating the firing, then mention the texts and his attorney's claims. Include the recommendation vs. firing, the IG's report, and Trump's support. Make sure to note that there's no evidence his views affected his work. Conclude with the implications for the bureau's integrity and democracy. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok was fired after Justice Department investigators found texts criticizing President Trump, despite an FBI official recommending a suspension and demotion. His attorney, Aitan Goelman, argued the decision was politically motivated, violating First Amendment rights, as no evidence linked Strzok's personal views to his work. The FBI's inspector general report flagged Strzok's texts as potentially biased, and his extramarital relationship with another official may have influenced the decision. Trump celebrated the firing, calling for his campaign investigation to be dropped. The case raises concerns about political interference and the integrity of the FBI's disciplinary process. END OF SUMMARY.
