SUMMARY:

FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team due to anti-Trump texts, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was made under political pressure and violated the First Amendment. Strzok, a 21-year veteran, played a prominent role in the Clinton and Trump campaign investigations. He exchanged texts with Lisa Page that disparaged Trump and other politicians. The inspector general report criticized Strzok's texts, which implied bias and improper considerations, and his use of personal email for FBI business. Strzok's extramarital relationship with Page may have also contributed to the FBI's decision. President Trump celebrated Strzok's firing on Twitter, calling for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped and the Clinton investigation to be redone.

END OF SUMMARY.
