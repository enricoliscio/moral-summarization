Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. The user provided the text and the specific morally framed words to include. I need to make sure the summary uses as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Strzok was fired despite a recommendation for suspension and demotion. His attorney argues it's a departure from normal practice and due to political pressure. The texts he sent were critical of Trump, and the Inspector General found potential bias in his actions. Trump celebrated the firing.

I need to include the moral words like departure, failed, decision, taken, punish, harm, weaken, impacted, considerations, take, impact, hold. I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflict between the recommended punishment and the firing, the political angle, and the implications on democracy.

I should start by stating Strzok was fired against the recommendation. Then mention Goelman's points about departure from practice and political pressure. Include the lack of evidence against Strzok and the impact on democracy. Then note the Inspector General's concerns about bias and official actions. Finally, mention Trump's reaction and the implications on the investigations.

I'll make sure each sentence incorporates the moral framing words where appropriate. Let me draft that concisely, keeping it under 200 words. I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically and covers all key points without being too detailed.

SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok was fired by Deputy Director David Bowdich despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok’s attorney, Aitan Goelman, called the decision a “departure from typical Bureau practice,” arguing it was taken in response to political pressure to punish Strzok for his anti-Trump texts, which were protected under the First Amendment. Goelman emphasized that no evidence linked Strzok’s personal views to his work, asserting the decision would harm democracy and weaken accountability. The Inspector General found Strzok’s texts potentially impacted investigative decisions with bias, and his use of personal email for FBI business was criticized. Trump celebrated Strzok’s firing, urging the investigation into his campaign to be dropped and Clinton’s probe redone. The decision to terminate Strzok, despite the recommendation, raises concerns about political influence and fairness in the FBI’s disciplinary process. END OF SUMMARY.
