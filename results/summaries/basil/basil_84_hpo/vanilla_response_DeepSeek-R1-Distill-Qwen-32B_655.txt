Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Peter Strzok, an FBI Special Agent, was removed from Robert Mueller's team because of his texts that were critical of Trump. Now, he's been fired despite a recommendation for a suspension and demotion. His attorney, Aitan Goelman, says this decision is unusual and suggests it's due to political pressure, not based on a fair review. Goelman emphasizes that Strzok's personal views didn't affect his work, and he was a top counterintelligence officer.

Strzok had exchanged texts with Lisa Page, another former FBI official, criticizing Trump and some Democrats. He testified after an inspector general report on the FBI's handling of the Clinton probe, which included these anti-Trump texts. Strzok was involved in both the Clinton and Trump investigations during the 2016 election. He joined Mueller's team but left when Mueller found out about his texts.

The article mentions that the exact reason for his firing isn't clear, but the inspector general was troubled by his texts implying bias in investigative decisions. Also, Strzok used personal email for FBI business. His extramarital relationship with Page might have been a factor. FBI Director Wray said they hold people accountable, and Trump celebrated the firing, suggesting dropping the Trump investigation and redoing the Clinton one.

So, the main points are: Strzok's firing after texts critical of Trump, despite recommendations for lesser punishment. His attorney claims it's politically motivated. Strzok's role in key investigations, the inspector general's concerns about bias, and Trump's reaction.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the key events and implications. I should mention his firing, the texts, the attorney's claims, his professional role, the inspector general's findings, and Trump's response.

Let me structure it: Start with his firing, the reason (texts), the recommendation vs. the decision. Then his attorney's perspective, his role in the investigations, the inspector general's concerns, and Trump's reaction.

I should make sure to include that there's no evidence his views affected his work and that the firing might be politically motivated. Also, mention the possible factors like the relationship and personal email use.

I think that's a solid outline. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, keeping it concise.

SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok was fired after his texts critical of President Trump were discovered, despite a recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. His attorney argued the decision was politically motivated, citing Strzok's exemplary service and lack of evidence linking his views to his work. Strzok, a key figure in the Clinton and Trump investigations, had exchanged anti-Trump texts with Lisa Page. The inspector general flagged his texts as potentially biased and criticized his use of personal email. Trump celebrated the firing, suggesting dropping his investigation and redoing the Clinton probe. The decision's exact justification remains unclear, but political pressure and personal conduct may have played roles. END OF SUMMARY.
