SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, known for his role in investigations surrounding the 2016 election campaigns, has been fired from the bureau due to his exchange of anti-Trump text messages with former FBI official Lisa Page. Despite the recommendation of a career FBI official for a lesser punishment, FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich ordered Strzok's dismissal, a decision that Strzok's attorney claims was influenced by political pressure from President Trump, who has publicly disparaged Strzok. The firing raises concerns about political interference in the justice system and sets a dangerous precedent by punishing Strzok for exercising his right to free speech. It also contradicts FBI Director Chris Wray's assurance that the bureau would follow its regular process despite Trump's disdain for Strzok. The inspector general's report on the matter expressed concern over the appearance of bias in Strzok's texts but found no evidence that his personal views impacted his investigative decisions. The report also criticized Strzok's use of personal email for FBI business and his extramarital relationship with Page. Trump celebrated Strzok's firing and called for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped.
END OF SUMMARY.
