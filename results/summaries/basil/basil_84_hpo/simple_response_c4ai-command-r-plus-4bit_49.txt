SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, known for his role in the investigations of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's campaigns during the 2016 election, has been fired from the bureau due to text messages exchanged with former FBI official Lisa Page that expressed anti-Trump sentiments. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, argued that the decision to fire Strzok was influenced by political pressure from Trump and was a violation of Strzok's First Amendment rights. The firing contradicted the recommendation of an FBI career official, who suggested a suspension and demotion. Despite the lack of evidence that Strzok's personal views impacted his work, the decision was made based on the appearance of bias and the potential impact on investigative decisions. The case raises concerns about the influence of political pressure on disciplinary actions within the FBI and the potential chilling effect on free speech. Trump celebrated Strzok's firing and called for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped.

END OF SUMMARY.
