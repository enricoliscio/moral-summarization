SUMMARY:

FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team due to anti-Trump texts, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was made under political pressure and violates the First Amendment, as Strzok's personal views never affected his work. Strzok, a 21-year veteran, played a prominent role in investigations surrounding the Clinton and Trump campaigns during the 2016 election. He exchanged texts with former FBI official Lisa Page that disparaged Trump and other politicians. The FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility recommended a suspension, but FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich ordered Strzok's termination. President Trump celebrated the firing on Twitter, calling for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped and the Clinton investigation to be re-done.

END OF SUMMARY.
