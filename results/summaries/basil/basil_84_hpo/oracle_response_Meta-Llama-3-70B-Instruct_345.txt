SUMMARY:

FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team due to anti-Trump texts, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. This decision is a "departure from typical Bureau practice" and contradicts FBI Director Chris Wray's guarantee to follow regular process. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, argues that the firing is a result of "political pressure" and an attempt to "punish" Strzok for his protected First Amendment speech, rather than a fair examination of the facts. The decision is "deeply troubling" and produces only one winner - those who seek to "harm our country and weaken our democracy." Strzok's firing is a result of biased considerations, and the justification for it is unclear. Trump celebrated the firing on Twitter, which raises concerns about the politicization of the FBI.

END OF SUMMARY.
