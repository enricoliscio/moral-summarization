SUMMARY:
FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who exchanged texts disparaging President Trump, has been fired from the bureau despite the recommendations of a career FBI official. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, called the decision "troubling," arguing that it contradicted FBI Director Chris Wray's earlier guarantees and was made in response to political pressure to punish Strzok for his protected political speech. The decision was made by FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich, who overruled the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility's recommendation of a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok played a prominent role in the investigations into both the Clinton and Trump campaigns during the 2016 election. He was removed from Mueller's team once his anti-Trump texts were discovered. The inspector general report expressed concern over Strzok's texts, suggesting a potential bias and improper considerations that could impact investigative decisions. It also criticized Strzok's use of personal email for FBI business and his extramarital relationship. Trump celebrated Strzok's firing, calling for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped and the Clinton investigation to be redone. Goelman argued that Strzok's personal views never affected his work and that the firing was a victory for those seeking to harm and weaken democracy.
