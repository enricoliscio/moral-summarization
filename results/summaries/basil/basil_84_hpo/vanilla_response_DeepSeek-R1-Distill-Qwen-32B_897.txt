Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by saying that Peter Strzok, an FBI agent who was on Robert Mueller's team, was fired despite a recommendation for a suspension and demotion. His attorney, Aitan Goelman, claims this decision was political and against typical FBI practices. Goelman argues that Strzok's personal views didn't affect his work and that the firing was due to political pressure, citing the First Amendment.

Strzok had exchanged texts with Lisa Page that criticized Trump and other politicians. He testified after an inspector general report on the Clinton probe, which mentioned these anti-Trump texts. Strzok was involved in both the Clinton and Trump investigations during the 2016 election and joined Mueller's team but left when Mueller found out about the texts.

The inspector general was troubled by Strzok's texts, especially one implying bias affecting investigative decisions. They also criticized his use of personal email for FBI business. It's possible his affair with Page influenced the decision. FBI Director Wray said they would hold people accountable after the disciplinary process. Trump celebrated Strzok's firing on Twitter, suggesting dropping the Trump investigation and redoing the Clinton one.

So, the main points are:
- Strzok was fired despite a recommendation for suspension.
- His attorney claims it's politically motivated.
- Strzok's texts criticized Trump and were part of the investigation.
- Inspector general concerns about bias and personal email use.
- Possible influence from his affair with Page.
- Trump's reaction to the firing.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include all these elements without getting too detailed. I should keep it clear and concise, highlighting the political angle and the reasons behind the firing.

SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok was fired after Justice Department investigators found texts critical of President Trump. Despite a career FBI official recommending a 60-day suspension and demotion, Deputy Director David Bowdich ordered his termination. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, called the decision politically motivated, citing the lack of evidence linking Strzok's personal views to his work. Strzok, a key figure in the Clinton and Trump investigations during the 2016 election, exchanged texts with Lisa Page that disparaged Trump. An inspector general report criticized his texts for potentially indicating bias and improper use of personal email. The decision to fire Strzok, despite a recommendation for lesser punishment, was questioned as politically driven, with Trump celebrating the move on Twitter. END OF SUMMARY.
