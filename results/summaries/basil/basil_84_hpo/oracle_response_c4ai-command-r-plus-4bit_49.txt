SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who exchanged texts disparaging President Trump and other politicians, was fired from the bureau despite the recommendations of a career FBI official for a less severe punishment. Strzok's attorney called the decision "deeply troubling," suggesting that it was made in response to political pressure and as punishment for Strzok's political speech, which is protected by the First Amendment. The decision failed to consider Strzok's decades of exemplary service and the lack of evidence that his personal views ever impacted his work. This departure from typical Bureau practice sends a concerning message and may weaken our democracy by giving ammunition to those who seek to harm our country and undermine our institutions. The precise justification for Strzok's firing is unclear, but it follows criticism from the DOJ inspector general, who was "deeply troubled" by Strzok's texts and their potential impact on investigative decisions. The inspector general also criticized Strzok's use of personal email for FBI business. FBI Director Wray had previously stated that the bureau would hold individuals accountable, and Trump celebrated Strzok's firing.
END OF SUMMARY.
