Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave it. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about Peter Strzok, an FBI agent who was fired despite a recommendation for a suspension and demotion. His attorney, Aitan Goelman, claims this decision was politically motivated, especially because Strzok had texts critical of Trump. The attorney argues that there's no evidence his personal views affected his work and that the firing was a response to political pressure, violating the First Amendment.

Strzok was involved in key investigations during the 2016 election, both with Clinton and Trump. He left Mueller's team when his texts were discovered. The DOJ's inspector general was concerned about potential bias in his texts and his use of personal email. There's also a mention of an extramarital relationship possibly influencing the decision.

The summary needs to highlight the moral issues: political interference, violation of free speech, and the integrity of the FBI. I should mention Strzok's firing, the attorney's arguments, the lack of evidence against his work, the political context, and the inspector general's concerns. Also, note Trump's reaction and the implications for the bureau's independence.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral framing is clear. I'll structure it to first state the firing, then the attorney's claims, the lack of evidence, the political angle, the inspector general's points, and the broader implications.
