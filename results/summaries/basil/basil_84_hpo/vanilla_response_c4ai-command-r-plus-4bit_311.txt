SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, known for his involvement in investigations surrounding the Clinton and Trump campaigns during the 2016 election, has been fired from the bureau due to text messages exchanged with former FBI official Lisa Page that were disparaging towards President Trump and other politicians. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, stated that the decision to fire Strzok was influenced by political pressure and contradicted FBI Director Chris Wray's earlier guarantee to follow regular process. The decision has been criticized as a departure from typical FBI practice and a punishment for Strzok's First Amendment rights. President Trump celebrated Strzok's firing on Twitter, calling for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped. The precise justification for Strzok's firing remains unclear, but it may be related to the appearance of bias in his text messages and the use of personal email for FBI business. 

END OF SUMMARY.
