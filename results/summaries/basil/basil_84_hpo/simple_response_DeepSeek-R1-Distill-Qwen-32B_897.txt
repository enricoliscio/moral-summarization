Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Peter Strzok, an FBI agent who was fired. He was part of Robert Mueller's team but was removed after some texts were found where he criticized Trump. His attorney, Aitan Goelman, says he was fired despite a recommendation for a suspension and demotion. Goelman claims this was a political move, not based on facts, and a violation of free speech.

Strzok's texts with Lisa Page, another FBI official, were critical of Trump and some Democrats. He was involved in both Clinton and Trump investigations during the 2016 election. The inspector general's report was concerned about his texts possibly influencing investigative decisions and his use of personal email. There's also mention of his extramarital relationship with Page possibly affecting the decision. Trump celebrated his firing and wants the Clinton investigation redone.

So, the summary needs to include these points: Strzok's firing, the texts, the attorney's claims of political pressure, the inspector general's concerns, and Trump's reaction. Also, the moral framing is that it's a political move against free speech.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll start by stating who Strzok is and why he was fired, then mention Goelman's argument about political pressure and free speech. Next, I'll note the inspector general's concerns and the possible reasons for firing, including the extramarital relationship. Finally, I'll include Trump's reaction.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Also, make sure the moral aspect is highlightedâ€”that the firing was politically motivated, not based on merit or facts.

SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok was fired despite a recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion, according to his attorney, Aitan Goelman. Goelman argued the decision was politically motivated, targeting Strzok for his anti-Trump texts, which were protected under the First Amendment. Strzok, a key figure in both the Clinton and Trump investigations during the 2016 election, exchanged disparaging texts about Trump with former FBI official Lisa Page. The inspector general was concerned these texts could indicate bias influencing investigative decisions, and Strzok's use of personal email for FBI business was also criticized. His extramarital relationship with Page may have contributed to the decision. Goelman emphasized that no evidence linked Strzok's views to his work performance, calling the firing a departure from FBI norms. Trump celebrated the firing, urging the Trump investigation to be dropped and the Clinton probe redone. END OF SUMMARY.
