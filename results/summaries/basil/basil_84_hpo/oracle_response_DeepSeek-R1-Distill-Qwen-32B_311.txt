Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I should make sure to include as many as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Peter Strzok was fired from the FBI despite a recommendation for a suspension and demotion. His attorney, Aitan Goelman, claims the firing was due to political pressure, not because of any wrongdoing. The article mentions that Strzok had exchanged texts criticizing Trump, which led to his removal from Mueller's team. The Inspector General's report found no evidence that his personal views affected his work but was concerned about the appearance of bias. Trump celebrated the firing, suggesting the investigation into his campaign should be dropped and Clinton's should be redone.

Now, I need to highlight the moral framing. Words like "departure," "failed," "decision," "punish," "harm," "weaken," "impacted," "considerations," "take," "impact," "hold" should be included. 

I'll structure the summary to mention Strzok's firing, the attorney's claim of political pressure, the lack of evidence against him, the Inspector General's concerns about bias, and Trump's reaction. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to convey the ethical issues involved, such as the departure from standard practices and the potential harm to democracy.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral language. Let me draft it, making sure each point is covered succinctly and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok was fired by Deputy Director David Bowdich despite a recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion from the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility. Strzok’s attorney, Aitan Goelman, called the decision a “departure from typical Bureau practice,” claiming it was taken in response to political pressure to punish Strzok for his anti-Trump texts, which were protected under the First Amendment. Goelman emphasized that no evidence linked Strzok’s personal views to his work, arguing the decision would harm democracy. Strzok, a 21-year FBI veteran, was involved in key investigations during the 2016 election but left Mueller’s team after his texts were discovered. The Inspector General found no evidence his views impacted his work but was troubled by the appearance of bias. Trump celebrated the firing, suggesting the Clinton investigation should be redone. The decision to terminate Strzok remains unclear, but it raises concerns about political considerations and the weakening of democratic processes. END OF SUMMARY.
