SUMMARY:
FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team due to anti-Trump texts, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney called the decision "deeply troubling" and a "departure from typical Bureau practice," suggesting it was made in response to political pressure and to punish Strzok for his political speech protected by the First Amendment. The decision is seen as a threat to democracy, as it appears to be influenced by bias and improper considerations. Strzok's 21-year service as a top counterintelligence officer was marred by his exchange of texts with Lisa Page, which were criticized by the DOJ's inspector general. The firing has been celebrated by President Trump, who tweeted that the investigation into his campaign should be dropped and the investigation into Clinton should be redone. END OF SUMMARY.
