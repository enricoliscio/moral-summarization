SUMMARY:

FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team due to anti-Trump texts, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was made under political pressure and violated the First Amendment, as there was no evidence that Strzok's personal views affected his work. Strzok, a 21-year veteran, played a key role in the Clinton and Trump campaign investigations. He exchanged texts with Lisa Page that disparaged Trump and other politicians. The FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility had recommended a lighter punishment, but FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich overruled it. The decision has been criticized, with Strzok's attorney calling it a "departure from typical Bureau practice." President Trump celebrated Strzok's firing on Twitter, saying the investigation into his campaign should be dropped and the Clinton investigation should be redone.

END OF SUMMARY.
