Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the text and the morally framed words. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. 

The article is about Peter Strzok, an FBI agent, being fired despite a recommendation for a suspension and demotion. His attorney, Goelman, argues that the firing was due to political pressure, not performance issues. The firing is seen as a departure from normal practices, and the decision was made despite a lack of evidence linking his personal views to his work. The inspector general was troubled by his texts, suggesting potential bias in investigations. Trump supports the firing and wants investigations changed.

Now, I need to include the moral words: departure, failed, decision, taken, punish, harm, weaken, impacted, considerations, take, impact, hold. I should structure the summary to highlight these terms, showing the conflict and the moral implications. 

I'll start by stating Strzok's firing, mention the departure from typical practice, Goelman's claims about political pressure, the lack of evidence, the IG's concerns, and Trump's reaction. I'll make sure to use the moral words where appropriate to frame the summary as the author intended. Keep it under 200 words and end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok was fired by Deputy Director David Bowdich despite a recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion from the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility. Strzok’s attorney, Aitan Goelman, called the decision a "departure from typical Bureau practice," arguing it was taken in response to political pressure to punish Strzok for his anti-Trump texts, which were protected under the First Amendment. Goelman emphasized that no evidence linked Strzok’s personal views to his work, asserting the decision would harm the country and weaken democracy. The inspector general was "deeply troubled" by Strzok’s texts, which potentially indicated bias or improper considerations in investigative decisions. Strzok’s extramarital relationship with Lisa Page may have also influenced the decision. FBI Director Chris Wray had earlier promised a fair process, but the firing contradicted that commitment. President Trump celebrated the decision, calling for the Russia investigation to be dropped and the Clinton probe to be redone. END OF SUMMARY.
