SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who exchanged text messages disparaging President Trump and other politicians during the 2016 election, has been fired from the bureau. Strzok played a prominent role in the investigations into both the Clinton email scandal and the Trump campaign's potential collusion with Russia. His anti-Trump texts were discovered by Justice Department investigators, leading to his removal from Special Counsel Mueller's team. Despite the recommendation of a career FBI official for a suspension and demotion, FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich ordered Strzok's firing. Strzok's attorney called the decision politically motivated and a violation of his First Amendment rights, arguing that there was no evidence of bias in Strzok's work. President Trump celebrated the firing on Twitter, calling for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped.
END OF SUMMARY.
