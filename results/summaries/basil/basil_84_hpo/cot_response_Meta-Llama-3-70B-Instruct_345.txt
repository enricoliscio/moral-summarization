SUMMARY:
FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team after his anti-Trump texts were discovered, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney called the decision "deeply troubling" and a "departure from typical Bureau practice," contradicting FBI Director Chris Wray's earlier guarantee to follow the regular process. The decision is seen as a response to political pressure, punishing Strzok for his protected First Amendment speech. Strzok's 21-year service and top counterintelligence work were ignored, and the move is a "win" for those who seek to harm our country and weaken our democracy. The inspector general's report had criticized Strzok for his biased texts and use of personal email, but the firing decision raises questions about accountability and fairness. Trump celebrated the news on Twitter, calling for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped. END OF SUMMARY.
