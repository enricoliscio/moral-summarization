SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was taken off the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election due to anti-Trump texts, has been fired from the bureau despite recommendations for a lesser punishment. Strzok's attorney claims the decision was politically motivated and a violation of Strzok's First Amendment rights, suggesting it was made under pressure from those who seek to harm the country and weaken democracy. The firing comes despite a lack of evidence that Strzok's personal views impacted his work and despite concerns about the appearance of bias and improper conduct. The decision has been praised by President Trump, who has called for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped and for the Clinton investigation to be redone. END OF SUMMARY.
