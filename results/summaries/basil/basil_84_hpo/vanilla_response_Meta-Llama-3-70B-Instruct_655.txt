SUMMARY:

FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team due to anti-Trump texts, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, called the decision "a departure from typical Bureau practice" and attributed it to political pressure. Goelman argued that Strzok's personal views never affected his work and that the decision was made to punish him for political speech protected by the First Amendment. Strzok, a 21-year veteran of the FBI, played a prominent role in investigations surrounding the Clinton and Trump campaigns during the 2016 election. The precise justification for the firing is unclear, but it may be related to the inspector general's report criticizing Strzok's texts and use of personal email for FBI business. President Trump celebrated Strzok's firing on Twitter, calling for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped and the investigation into Clinton to be redone.

END OF SUMMARY.
