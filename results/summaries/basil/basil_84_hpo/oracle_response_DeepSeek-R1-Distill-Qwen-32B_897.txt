Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The user has specified certain words to include, so I'll make sure to highlight those. The article is about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI, so I'll start by identifying the key points: his firing despite a recommendation for suspension, the reasons behind it, and the political implications.

I should note that the attorney called the decision a "departure" from usual practice and that it "punished" Strzok for his speech. The firing is seen as "harmful" to democracy. I'll include words like "failed," "taken," "impact," and "hold" to maintain the moral tone. Also, the mention of political pressure and the First Amendment is crucial. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok was fired by Deputy Director David Bowdich despite a recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion from an FBI career official. Strzok’s attorney, Aitan Goelman, criticized the decision as a "departure from typical Bureau practice," arguing it was "punish[ment]" for his political speech, protected under the First Amendment. Goelman emphasized that no evidence linked Strzok’s personal views to his work, calling the decision "deeply troubling" and a threat to democracy. Strzok’s anti-Trump texts, including one suggesting bias in investigative decisions, were cited by the DOJ inspector general as "deeply troubling." The firing was seen as politically motivated, with Trump celebrating it on Twitter. The decision to terminate Strzok was "taken" despite a lack of evidence, raising concerns about political pressure and the "impact" on the FBI’s integrity. END OF SUMMARY.
