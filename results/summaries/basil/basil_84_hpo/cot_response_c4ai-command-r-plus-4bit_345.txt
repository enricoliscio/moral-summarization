SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who exchanged texts disparaging President Trump, has been fired from the bureau despite recommendations for a more lenient punishment. Strzok's attorney called the decision "troubling," arguing that it contradicted FBI Director Wray's earlier guarantees and punished Strzok for politically protected speech. The firing comes after an inspector general report found Strzok's texts "deeply troubling," indicating potential bias and improper considerations. While Strzok's conduct was criticized, his attorney argued that his personal views never affected his work and that the firing was a result of political pressure. The decision has been celebrated by Trump, who called for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped. The moral framing of the article centers around the potential injustice and harm caused by the firing, with Strzok's attorney arguing that it weakens democracy and punishes protected speech. END OF SUMMARY.
