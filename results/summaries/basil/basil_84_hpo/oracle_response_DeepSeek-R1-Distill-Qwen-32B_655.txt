Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and the specific morally framed words to include. First, I need to read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI despite a recommendation for suspension and demotion. His attorney argues it's due to political pressure, and the article mentions his anti-Trump texts and other issues like personal emails and a relationship. The user also listed words like "departure," "failed," "punish," etc., that should be included.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and uses those moral terms. I should focus on the key events: Strzok's firing, the attorney's claims, the lack of evidence against him, the political pressure angle, and the implications for democracy. Also, mention the inspector general's concerns and the possible factors like his personal relationship. I'll structure it to highlight the moral issues, like the departure from typical practices and the potential punishment for his speech. I'll avoid adding my own opinions and stick to the facts while using the specified words.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved. I'll start with the firing, mention the attorney's statement, the lack of evidence, the political angle, and the broader implications. I'll end with the impact on the investigations and the weakening of democracy. That should cover all the necessary elements while staying within the word limit.

SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok was fired by Deputy Director David Bowdich despite a recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion from the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility. Strzok’s attorney, Aitan Goelman, called the decision a "departure from typical Bureau practice," arguing it was taken in response to political pressure and to punish Strzok for his anti-Trump texts, which were protected under the First Amendment. Goelman emphasized that no evidence linked Strzok’s personal views to his work, asserting the decision would harm the country and weaken democracy. Strzok, a 21-year FBI veteran, exchanged anti-Trump texts with Lisa Page and was involved in high-profile investigations during the 2016 election. The inspector general was "deeply troubled" by Strzok’s texts, which potentially indicated bias or improper considerations in investigative decisions. The precise justification for his firing remains unclear, but his use of personal email and extramarital relationship with Page may have played a role. Director Chris Wray had earlier promised a fair process, but Trump celebrated Strzok’s firing, calling for the Trump investigation to be dropped and the Clinton probe to be redone. END OF SUMMARY.
