SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who exchanged anti-Trump texts with former FBI official Lisa Page, has been fired from the bureau despite the recommendations of a career FBI official. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, called the decision "a departure from typical Bureau practice" and claimed it was made in response to political pressure, rather than a fair examination of the facts. The decision comes after an investigation and Congressional testimony failed to find evidence that Strzok's personal views affected his work. Strzok played a prominent role in the investigations into both the Clinton and Trump campaigns during the 2016 election. He was removed from Mueller's team when his texts came to light and faced scrutiny for his use of personal email for FBI business. The precise justification for Strzok's firing is unclear, but it may be related to the appearance of bias in his text messages and his extramarital relationship with Page. Trump celebrated the firing on Twitter, calling for the investigation into his campaign to be dropped.
END OF SUMMARY.
