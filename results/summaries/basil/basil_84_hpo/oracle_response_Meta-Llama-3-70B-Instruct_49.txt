SUMMARY: FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from Robert Mueller's team due to anti-Trump texts, has been fired from the bureau despite a career official's recommendation for a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, called the decision a "departure from typical Bureau practice" that "should be deeply troubling to all Americans." The firing is seen as a political move to "punish" Strzok for his protected First Amendment speech, rather than a fair examination of the facts. Goelman argued that Strzok's personal views never "impacted" his work, and that the decision will only "harm" the country and "weaken" democracy. The inspector general's report had criticized Strzok's texts for potentially indicating bias, but Goelman believes the firing was taken in response to political pressure. Trump celebrated the news on Twitter, sparking concerns about the integrity of the investigation. The decision raises questions about the fairness and independence of the FBI's disciplinary process. END OF SUMMARY.
