Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

President Trump is reacting to a BuzzFeed article that says he told Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump Tower project. Trump is calling the article a "phony story" and says it's a disgrace to journalism. He appreciates Mueller's statement disputing the report. Mueller's office said BuzzFeed's description of statements and characterization of documents weren't accurate, but didn't provide details. BuzzFeed stands by their reporting, and Trump's team denies the claims. The article also mentions that this is the first time Trump explicitly told someone to lie about Russia dealings.

So, the moral framing here is about truthfulness, credibility, and the integrity of journalism. Trump is criticizing the media for spreading false stories, while the media is defending their reporting. There's also the aspect of Mueller's unusual move to respond, which adds to the tension.

I need to make sure the summary captures Trump's criticism of BuzzFeed and the media, Mueller's response, and the implications for journalism's credibility. Also, mention that this is the first instance of Trump directing a subordinate to lie about Russia dealings.

Let me structure this: start with Trump's reaction, mention the BuzzFeed article's claims, his criticism of the media, Mueller's response, BuzzFeed's defense, and the significance of the story as the first explicit lie by Trump.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include all key points without going into too much detail.
