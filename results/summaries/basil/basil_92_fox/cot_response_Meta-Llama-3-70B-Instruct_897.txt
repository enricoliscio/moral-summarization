SUMMARY:
President Trump praised Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office for disputing a "phony" BuzzFeed news report claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. Trump called the report a "disgrace to our country" and a "disgrace to journalism," saying the mainstream media's coverage was "disgraceful" and has "lost tremendous credibility." Mueller's office rarely issues statements, but did so in this case, disputing the article's claims. Trump's team and lawyer Rudy Giuliani also denied the report, with Giuliani saying the press's "hysterical desire to destroy this President has gone too far." BuzzFeed stands by its reporting, but Trump called the controversy a "very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our country." The incident highlights the tensions between the Trump administration and the media. END OF SUMMARY.
