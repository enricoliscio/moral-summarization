SUMMARY:

President Trump has appreciated the statement released by FBI special counsel Robert Mueller, disputing parts of a BuzzFeed news report. The report claimed that Trump directed his former attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the timing of discussions over a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the BuzzFeed piece a "total phony story" and a "disgrace to our country" and "journalism". He also criticized the mainstream media's coverage of the story, saying it has lost credibility. Mueller's office rarely issues statements, but did so in this case, saying that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were not accurate. Both Trump's team and BuzzFeed have stood by their reporting, with BuzzFeed saying they have seen no indication that any specific aspect of their story is inaccurate.

END OF SUMMARY.
