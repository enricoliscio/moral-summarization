SUMMARY: 
President Trump appreciated FBI special counsel Robert Mueller's statement refuting a BuzzFeed report that claimed Trump instructed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the BuzzFeed story a "disgrace" and criticized the mainstream media's "disgraceful" coverage of it, stating that their "credibility" was severely damaged. BuzzFeed's article, citing law enforcement sources, alleged that Cohen told Mueller's office that Trump directed him to lie, which would be a significant development in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. However, Mueller's office took the unusual step of disputing the report, stating that BuzzFeed's description was "not accurate." While BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, Trump's team, including lawyer Rudy Giuliani, praised Mueller's correction of the "false story." The incident highlights the media's questionable practices and their detrimental impact on journalism's credibility and the country.
END OF SUMMARY.
