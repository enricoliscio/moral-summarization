SUMMARY:

President Trump praised Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office for releasing a statement disputing parts of a BuzzFeed News report claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the BuzzFeed report "a total phony story" and "a disgrace to our country" and "journalism". Mueller's office rarely issues statements, but did so in this case, stating that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were "not accurate". BuzzFeed stands by its reporting and sources, and Trump's team has also denied the claims. The controversy has sparked a debate about journalism and credibility, with Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani criticizing the media's coverage of the story.

END OF SUMMARY.
