SUMMARY: President Trump expressed his appreciation for FBI special counsel Robert Mueller's rare statement disputing a BuzzFeed news report that claimed Trump directed his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the BuzzFeed story a "disgrace to journalism" and criticized the mainstream media's coverage of it, saying it would take a long time for their credibility to recover. BuzzFeed's report, citing law enforcement sources, alleged that Cohen told Mueller's team that Trump instructed him to lie, which would constitute a criminal act by the president. Mueller's office, in an unusual move, released a statement disputing the accuracy of BuzzFeed's description of Cohen's testimony. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, but Trump and his team, including lawyer Rudy Giuliani, praised Mueller for correcting the "false story." The controversy highlights the media's responsibility in reporting on sensitive political issues and the potential consequences of inaccurate or misleading information. 

END OF SUMMARY.
