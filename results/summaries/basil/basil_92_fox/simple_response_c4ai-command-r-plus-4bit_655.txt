SUMMARY: President Trump praised Special Counsel Mueller for releasing a statement disputing a BuzzFeed News report that claimed Trump directed his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the BuzzFeed piece a "disgrace to journalism" and criticized the mainstream media's coverage of it. BuzzFeed's report, citing law enforcement sources, alleged that Cohen told Mueller's team that Trump instructed him to lie, which would constitute a felony. Mueller's office rarely issues statements, but took the extraordinary step of disputing the BuzzFeed report, stating that their "description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony...are not accurate." BuzzFeed, however, stood by their reporting. Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, also praised Mueller's team for "correcting the BuzzFeed false story," while BuzzFeed's spokesman defended their reporting, saying they have "re-confirmed" their findings. This incident highlights the ethical dilemma of reporting on sensitive issues with potentially far-reaching consequences and the responsibility of the media to report accurately, especially when dealing with powerful figures and allegations of wrongdoing. 

END OF SUMMARY.
