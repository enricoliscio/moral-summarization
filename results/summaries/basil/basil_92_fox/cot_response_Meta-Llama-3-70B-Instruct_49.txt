SUMMARY:
President Trump praised special counsel Robert Mueller for releasing a statement disputing parts of a BuzzFeed news report, calling the article a "total phony story" and a "disgrace to our country" and "journalism". Trump appreciated Mueller's office for taking the "appropriate" step of correcting the report, which he believed was "disgraceful" and would take a long time for the mainstream media to recover its "tremendous" lost credibility. The report claimed that Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the timing of discussions over a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Mueller's office disputed the article, saying that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were "not accurate". Trump's team and lawyer Rudy Giuliani also denied the claims, calling it a "very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our country". BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, saying it saw no indication that any specific aspect of its story was inaccurate. END OF SUMMARY.
