SUMMARY:

President Trump applauded FBI special counsel Robert Mueller for releasing a statement disputing parts of a BuzzFeed news report, which Trump deemed a "total phony story" and a "disgrace to our country" and "journalism". The report claimed Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the timing of discussions over a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were "not accurate". Trump praised Mueller's office for "correcting the Buzzfeed false story", while BuzzFeed stood by its reporting and urged Mueller to clarify what he was disputing. Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani also praised Mueller's office, saying the press's "hysterical desire to destroy this President has gone too far". The controversy highlights the importance of accurate reporting and the need for credible journalism.
