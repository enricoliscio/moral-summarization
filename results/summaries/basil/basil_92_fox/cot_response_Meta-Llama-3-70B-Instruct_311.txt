SUMMARY:
President Trump applauded FBI special counsel Robert Mueller's office for disputing parts of a "phony" BuzzFeed news report claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. Trump called the report a "disgrace to our country" and "journalism," and said the mainstream media's coverage was "disgraceful" and has "lost tremendous credibility." The report alleged that Trump told Cohen to lie about the timing of discussions over a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Mueller's office rarely issues statements, but took the extraordinary step of releasing a statement disputing the article. Trump's team and lawyer Rudy Giuliani also denied the claims, calling it a "very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our country." BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, saying it saw no indication that any specific aspect of its story was inaccurate. The controversy highlights the tension between the media and the Trump administration.
END OF SUMMARY.
