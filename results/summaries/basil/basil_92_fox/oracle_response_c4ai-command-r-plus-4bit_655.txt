SUMMARY: President Trump denounced a BuzzFeed News article claiming he directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow, calling it a "disgrace to journalism." The article cited law enforcement sources and stated that Cohen acknowledged to Mueller's office that Trump told him to lie. Mueller's office, which rarely issues statements, disputed the article's accuracy, saying that BuzzFeed's "description of specific statements...are not accurate." Trump praised Mueller's statement and criticized the mainstream media's coverage of the story. BuzzFeed, however, stands by its reporting, while Trump's team denied the claims. This controversy has sparked discussions about journalistic ethics and the role of the press in a politically charged environment. The article also raises questions about the potential implications for Trump regarding his dealings with Russia during the presidential campaign.
