Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should use as many of those as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. President Trump is reacting to a BuzzFeed article claiming he directed Cohen to lie about the Moscow project. Trump criticizes the article and media coverage, calling them disgraceful. Mueller's office disputes the report, which is unusual for them. BuzzFeed stands by their reporting, and Trump's team denies the claims.

I need to include the morally charged words like "claiming," "story," "coverage," "disgrace," "statement," "appropriate," "accurate," "correcting," "destroy," etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight Trump's criticism, Mueller's rare statement, and the ongoing dispute between BuzzFeed and Trump's team.

I'll start by mentioning Trump's appreciation for Mueller's statement, then his criticism of the story and media coverage. Next, I'll explain what the BuzzFeed article claimed, including Cohen's testimony. Then, I'll note Mueller's correction and the unusual move. Finally, I'll mention BuzzFeed's defense and Trump's team's denial.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically and includes all the key points while using the moral terms. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each part is covered and the moral framing is maintained.

SUMMARY: President Trump expressed appreciation for FBI special counsel Robert Mueller's statement disputing a BuzzFeed article claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump Tower project. Trump criticized the "phony story" and its coverage, calling it a disgrace to journalism and the country. BuzzFeed's article, based on law enforcement sources, alleged Cohen admitted to Mueller's office that Trump told him to lie about the project's timeline to conceal Trump's involvement. It also claimed Trump planned to visit Russia during the campaign to negotiate the deal. Mueller's office rarely comments but issued a rare statement correcting BuzzFeed's description of Cohen's testimony, though it did not provide further details. BuzzFeed defended its reporting, stating it stood by its sources and findings. Trump's team denied the claims, with Trump calling the controversy a "sad day for journalism" but a "great day for our country." Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani praised Mueller's office for "correcting the Buzzfeed false story," while BuzzFeed's spokesman reaffirmed the organization's confidence in its reporting. END OF SUMMARY.
