Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about President Trump and the Buzzfeed story. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts with Trump appreciating Mueller's statement disputing Buzzfeed's report. Buzzfeed claimed Trump told Cohen to lie about the Moscow project. Trump called the story fake and said it's a disgrace to journalism. Mueller's office rarely comments, but they did this time, saying Buzzfeed's description wasn't accurate. Buzzfeed stands by their reporting, and Trump's team denied the claims. Giuliani also criticized the media.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Trump's reaction, the Buzzfeed story's details, Mueller's response, Buzzfeed's defense, and Trump's team's denial. Also, note the rare move by Mueller's office to comment. Make sure to mention that Mueller didn't provide specifics in their statement.

I should structure it clearly, starting with Trump's appreciation, then the Buzzfeed story, Mueller's response, Buzzfeed's defense, and Trump's team's denial. Keep it concise, focusing on the key points without getting bogged down in details.

Let me make sure I include all the important elements: Trump's dismissal of the story, Buzzfeed's claims about Cohen and the Moscow deal, Mueller's rare statement, Buzzfeed's confidence in their reporting, and the implications for media credibility.

I think that's all. Now, I'll put it together in a clear, concise summary.
