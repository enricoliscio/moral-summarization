Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the tone.

The article is about President Trump reacting to a BuzzFeed report that claims he directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump Tower project. Trump is dismissing the story as fake and appreciates Mueller's office for disputing it. He criticizes BuzzFeed and the mainstream media, saying their credibility is lost. Mueller's office rarely comments but issued a statement saying BuzzFeed's description of Cohen's testimony was inaccurate. BuzzFeed stands by their reporting, and Trump's team also denies the claims.

I should structure the summary to include Trump's dismissal of the story, his criticism of the media, Mueller's rare statement, and the ongoing dispute between BuzzFeed and Trump's team. I need to keep the moral framing, so I'll highlight Trump's accusations of fake news and media bias, as well as the tension between Mueller's office and BuzzFeed.

I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and ends with the specified tokens. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring all key points are covered without going into too much detail.

He thanked Robert Mueller's office for disputing the article, marking an unusual move for Mueller's team. BuzzFeed claimed Cohen admitted to lying about the project's timeline to conceal Trump's involvement, suggesting Trump explicitly told a subordinate to lie about his dealings with Russia. Mueller's office stated BuzzFeed's description of Cohen's testimony was inaccurate, though no further details were provided. Trump and his team denied the allegations, with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani accusing the media of bias. BuzzFeed defended its reporting, asserting no inaccuracies were found. Trump also criticized mainstream media for losing credibility, while Mueller's office's rare statement highlighted the ongoing tensions over the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
