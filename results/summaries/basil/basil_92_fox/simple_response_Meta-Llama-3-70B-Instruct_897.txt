SUMMARY:

President Trump praised Special Counsel Robert Mueller for disputing a BuzzFeed news report claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the report a "total phony story" and a "disgrace to our country" and "journalism". He also criticized the mainstream media's coverage of the story, saying it will take a long time for them to recover their credibility. Mueller's office rarely issues statements, but did so in this case, disputing the article's characterization of documents and testimony obtained by the office. BuzzFeed stands by its reporting and sources, and Trump's team has also denied the claims. The incident has sparked a heated debate about journalism and credibility.

END OF SUMMARY.
