SUMMARY:

President Trump praised FBI special counsel Robert Mueller for releasing a statement disputing parts of a BuzzFeed news report, which Trump called a "total phony story" and a "disgrace to our country" and "journalism". The report claimed Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the timing of discussions over a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were "not accurate". Trump's team also denied the claims, with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani praising Mueller's office for "correcting the Buzzfeed false story". BuzzFeed stood by their reporting, saying they've seen no indication that any specific aspect of their story is inaccurate. Trump criticized the mainstream media's coverage of the story, saying it's "going to take a long time for the mainstream media to recover its credibility".

END OF SUMMARY.
