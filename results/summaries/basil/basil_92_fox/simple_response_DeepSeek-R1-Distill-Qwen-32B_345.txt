Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump reacting to a BuzzFeed report. The report claims that Trump told Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump Tower project. Trump and his team are dismissing the report, calling it fake news. They appreciate Mueller's office disputing the report, which is unusual for them. BuzzFeed stands by their story, citing sources, and says Mueller's statement isn't helpful. The article also mentions the impact on media credibility and Trump's criticism of the media.

I should structure the summary to highlight the key points: Trump's dismissal of the report, Mueller's rare statement, BuzzFeed's defense, and the implications on media credibility. I need to make sure the moral framing is clear, showing Trump and Mueller's side versus BuzzFeed's, and the debate over media integrity.

I'll start by stating Trump's reaction, then mention Mueller's statement, followed by BuzzFeed's response. I'll also touch on the broader issue of media credibility and Trump's criticism of the media. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll ensure each sentence is concise and captures the essence without unnecessary details.

Let me draft it:

President Trump criticized a BuzzFeed report claiming he directed Michael Cohen to lie about the Moscow project, calling it fake news and praising Mueller's office for disputing it. Mueller's office rarely comments but released a statement saying the report's descriptions and characterizations were inaccurate. BuzzFeed defended its reporting, stating they stand by their sources and findings. Trump's team, including Giuliani, criticized the media's credibility, while Trump accused the mainstream media of losing credibility. The situation highlights the ongoing conflict between the administration and the press over reporting accuracy and integrity.

That's concise, under 200 words, and preserves the moral framing by showing both sides' arguments and the impact on media credibility.
