Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The article is about President Trump's response to a BuzzFeed report and the subsequent statements from Mueller's office.

First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points. The main points are:

1. BuzzFeed published a story claiming Trump told Cohen to lie about the Moscow deal.
2. Trump and his team, including Mueller's office, disputed the report.
3. Trump criticized the media, calling the story a disgrace.
4. Mueller's office rarely comments but released a statement this time.
5. The article's implications on Trump's credibility and potential legal issues.
6. The ongoing debate between BuzzFeed and Trump's team.

Now, I need to capture the moral framing. The article presents Trump as defending himself against accusations of lying, which is a serious moral issue. The media's role in reporting and the credibility aspect are also key moral points. I should ensure the summary reflects the conflict between Trump's accusations of fake news and the media's responsibility to report accurately.

I should structure the summary to include Trump's appreciation of Mueller's statement, his criticism of BuzzFeed and mainstream media, the content of the BuzzFeed article, Mueller's rare response, and the ongoing dispute between the parties involved.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it's clear and captures all essential elements without bias, just presenting the facts as per the article's moral perspective.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure to include all these elements and maintain the moral framing as presented in the article.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized a BuzzFeed article alleging he instructed former attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump Tower project, calling it a "disgrace" to journalism and the country. Trump praised FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller's rare statement disputing the report, which BuzzFeed based on law enforcement sources claiming Cohen admitted to Mueller's office that Trump directed him to mislead Congress. Trump's team denied the claims, with Trump calling the controversy a "sad day for journalism" but a "great day for our country." Mueller's office, which rarely comments, stated BuzzFeed's description of Cohen's testimony and related documents was inaccurate. BuzzFeed defended its reporting, urging Mueller to clarify his objections. Trump also criticized mainstream media coverage, asserting it had lost credibility due to its handling of the story. The dispute highlights tensions over reporting on Trump's potential Russia ties and the media's role in accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
