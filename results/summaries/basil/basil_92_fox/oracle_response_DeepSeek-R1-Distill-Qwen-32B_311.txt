Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

President Trump is reacting to a BuzzFeed article that claims he directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow project. Trump and his team are calling the story a "phony" and a "disgrace," which are strong moral terms. Mueller's office released a statement disputing the article, which is unusual. The article also mentions Cohen's testimony as a significant development.

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's criticism of the media, the unusual response from Mueller's office, and the ongoing debate over the story's accuracy. I need to include words like "claiming," "story," "statement," "disgrace," "phony," "coverage," "lie," and others from the list.

I should start by mentioning Trump's appreciation for Mueller's statement, then move on to his criticism of BuzzFeed and the media. Next, I'll explain what the article claims, including Cohen's testimony. Then, I'll note Mueller's response and the reactions from both sides—BuzzFeed defending their reporting and Trump's team dismissing it.

I need to keep the summary concise, around 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. I'll ensure that the morally charged words are included to reflect the author's framing.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure each key point is covered and the moral terms are preserved.

SUMMARY: President Trump expressed appreciation for FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s statement disputing a BuzzFeed article claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump Tower project. Trump criticized the "phony" story, calling it a "disgrace" to journalism and the country, and accused the mainstream media of losing credibility. The article, based on Cohen’s testimony, alleged Trump explicitly told Cohen to lie about his dealings with Russia, marking a significant development. Mueller’s office, which rarely comments, issued a statement denying BuzzFeed’s description of Cohen’s testimony as inaccurate. Trump’s team, including lawyer Rudy Giuliani, praised Mueller’s office for "correcting" the false story, while BuzzFeed defended its reporting, stating it stood by its sources and findings. The controversy highlights tensions between the administration and the media, with Trump labeling it a "sad day for journalism" but a "great day for our country." END OF SUMMARY.
