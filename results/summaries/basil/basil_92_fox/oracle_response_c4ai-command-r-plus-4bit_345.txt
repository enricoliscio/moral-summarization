SUMMARY: President Trump expressed his appreciation for FBI special counsel Robert Mueller's statement disputing a BuzzFeed news article that claimed Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump deemed the piece a "disgrace to journalism" and criticized the mainstream media's coverage of it. The article alleged that Cohen's testimony revealed Trump's explicit instruction to lie about his dealings with Russia, but Mueller's office called BuzzFeed's description of statements and characterization of documents inaccurate. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, while Trump's team denied the claims. The incident sparked discussions about media credibility and the potential impact on Trump's presidency. The morally framed words in the summary include: claiming, piece, coverage, story, statement, appropriate, article, lie, dealings, description, statements, accurate.
END OF SUMMARY.
