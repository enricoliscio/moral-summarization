SUMMARY:

President Trump praised special counsel Robert Mueller for releasing a statement disputing parts of a BuzzFeed news report, which Trump called a "total phony story" and a "disgrace to our country" and "journalism". The report claimed Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the timing of discussions over a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were "not accurate". Trump's team also denied the claims, with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani praising Mueller's office for "correcting the Buzzfeed false story". BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, urging Mueller to make clear what he's disputing. Trump criticized the mainstream media's coverage, saying it's "lost tremendous credibility" and will take a long time to recover. The controversy has sparked a heated debate, with Trump calling it a "very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our country".
