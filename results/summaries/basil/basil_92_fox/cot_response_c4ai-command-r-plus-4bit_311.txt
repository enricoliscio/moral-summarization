SUMMARY: President Trump has criticized BuzzFeed News for publishing a "phony story" that he directed his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow. The article claimed that Cohen had acknowledged this to Mueller's office, but Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's characterization, stating that their description was "not accurate". Trump called the article a "disgrace" and criticized the mainstream media for its "disgraceful" coverage, stating that their credibility has been damaged. He also appreciated Mueller's team for their "appropriate" response in disputing the story. BuzzFeed, however, stands by its reporting and urges Mueller to clarify his statement. Trump's team and lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, also denied the claims in the article, with Giuliani accusing the press of having a "hysterical desire to destroy this President." BuzzFeed has since reaffirmed its confidence in its reporting, stating that it has seen no indication that any specific aspect of its story is inaccurate. This incident has raised questions about journalistic ethics and the credibility of the media, with some believing it to be a sad day for journalism.
