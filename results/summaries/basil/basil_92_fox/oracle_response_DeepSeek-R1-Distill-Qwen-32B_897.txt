Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary, under 200 words, that includes as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump reacting to a BuzzFeed article that claims he told Michael Cohen to lie about the Moscow project. Trump appreciates Mueller's statement disputing the article. The article mentions the loss of credibility in the media, Trump's criticism of the media, and the ongoing investigation by Mueller.

I need to identify the key events and the moral language used. The author uses words like "claiming," "story," "coverage," "lie," "dealing," "description," "statements," "accurate," "correcting," "destroy," "gone," "reconfirmed," and "reported."

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. I'll start by mentioning Trump's appreciation of Mueller's statement. Then, I'll touch on the BuzzFeed article's claims and Trump's criticism of the media. I'll also include Mueller's response and the ongoing debate between BuzzFeed and Trump's team.

I need to ensure the summary is clear and concise, sticking to the main points without getting bogged down in details. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to maintain the original tone.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it flows well and includes the necessary elements. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words. After drafting, I'll review it to ensure all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: President Trump expressed appreciation for FBI special counsel Robert Mueller's statement disputing a BuzzFeed article claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow project. Trump criticized the article, calling it a "disgrace" to journalism and the country, and accused the mainstream media of losing credibility. BuzzFeed's story, based on two law enforcement sources, alleged Cohen admitted to Mueller's office that Trump told him to mislead Congress about the timing of the Moscow deal. The article described Trump's actions as a "significant new frontier" in his dealings with Russia. Mueller's office rarely comments on investigations but released a statement to correct BuzzFeed's "description" of Cohen's testimony, stating it was inaccurate. Trump's team denied the claims, with Trump calling the controversy a "sad day for journalism" but a "great day for our country." Mueller's spokesperson, Peter Carr, disputed BuzzFeed's account, while BuzzFeed's editor in chief, Ben Smith, defended the reporting and urged Mueller to clarify. Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, criticized the media's "hysterical desire to destroy" Trump, while BuzzFeed's spokesman, Matt Mittenthal, reaffirmed the story's accuracy. The debate over the article's accuracy and implications for Trump's credibility continues. END OF SUMMARY.
