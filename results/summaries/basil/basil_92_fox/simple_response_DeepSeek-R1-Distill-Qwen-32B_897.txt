Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the tone.

The article is about President Trump reacting to a BuzzFeed story. The story claims that Trump told Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump Tower project. Trump appreciates Mueller's statement disputing the Buzzfeed report, calling it a "phony story" and a disgrace to journalism. He also criticizes mainstream media for losing credibility.

BuzzFeed's story is based on two law enforcement officials, stating that Cohen admitted to Mueller's office that he lied about the timing of the Moscow deal to conceal Trump's involvement. This is significant because it's the first known instance of Trump explicitly telling a subordinate to lie about his dealings with Russia. BuzzFeed also reports that Trump planned to visit Russia during the campaign to meet Putin and negotiate the deal.

Mueller's office rarely comments, but they issued a statement saying Buzzfeed's description of statements and characterization of documents were inaccurate. They didn't provide details. Buzzfeed's editor stands by their reporting, and Trump's team denied the claims. Trump called the controversy a sad day for journalism but a great day for the country. His lawyer, Giuliani, praised Mueller for correcting Buzzfeed and criticized the press for going too far in their desire to destroy Trump.

Buzzfeed's spokesman reaffirmed their confidence in the reporting and said they'd share more as possible.

The moral framing here seems to be Trump and Mueller's office accusing Buzzfeed of false reporting and attacking the media's credibility, while Buzzfeed defends their story. The article highlights the conflict between the administration and the media, with accusations of bias and credibility issues on both sides.

I need to make sure the summary captures this conflict and the moral judgments each side is making. I'll focus on the key actions: Trump's appreciation of Mueller's statement, the Buzzfeed story's claims, Mueller's refutation, and the reactions from both sides. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral tone is preserved.
