SUMMARY: President Trump expressed his appreciation for FBI special counsel Robert Mueller's rare statement disputing a BuzzFeed News report that claimed Trump directed his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the BuzzFeed piece a "disgrace to journalism" and criticized the mainstream media's coverage of it. He suggested that the media's credibility had been significantly damaged. BuzzFeed's report, citing anonymous sources, alleged that Cohen told Mueller's team that Trump instructed him to lie, which would constitute a criminal act. Mueller's office, in an unusual move, released a statement calling the BuzzFeed report inaccurate but without providing further details. BuzzFeed, however, stood by its reporting, while Trump's team, including lawyer Rudy Giuliani, praised Mueller's statement and criticized the media's negative portrayal of the President. This incident highlights the ethical dilemma of reporting on sensitive issues based on anonymous sources and the potential consequences for journalistic credibility when such reports are disputed. It also underscores the importance of transparency and accuracy in journalism, especially when dealing with politically charged topics.

END OF SUMMARY.
