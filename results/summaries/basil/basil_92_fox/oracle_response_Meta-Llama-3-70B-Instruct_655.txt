SUMMARY:

President Trump praised special counsel Robert Mueller for releasing a statement disputing parts of a BuzzFeed news report, calling it a "total phony story" and a "disgrace to our country" and "journalism". The report claimed Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the timing of discussions over a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump appreciated Mueller's office for coming out with a statement, saying it was "appropriate" and that the mainstream media's coverage of the story was "disgraceful" and had "lost tremendous credibility". Mueller's office rarely issues statements, but took the extraordinary step of disputing the article, saying BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were "not accurate". BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, urging Mueller to make clear what he's disputing. Trump's team denied the claims, with Trump calling it a "very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our country".
