SUMMARY:

President Trump applauded Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office for disputing a BuzzFeed news report claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the report a "total phony story" and a "disgrace to our country" and "journalism". He also criticized the mainstream media's coverage of the story, saying it will take a long time for them to recover their credibility. Mueller's office rarely issues statements, but did so in this case, saying BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were not accurate. Both Trump's team and BuzzFeed are standing by their reports, with BuzzFeed urging Mueller's office to clarify what they are disputing. The controversy highlights the tension between the Trump administration and the media, with Trump's team accusing the press of having a "hysterical desire to destroy this President".
