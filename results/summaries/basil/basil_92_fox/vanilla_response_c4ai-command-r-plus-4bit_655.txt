SUMMARY: President Trump expressed his appreciation for FBI special counsel Robert Mueller's statement disputing a BuzzFeed news report. The report claimed that Trump directed his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about the timing of discussions regarding a Trump Tower project in Moscow. Mueller's office released a statement stating that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents were "not accurate". BuzzFeed, however, stood by its reporting. Trump called the BuzzFeed piece a "disgrace to journalism" and criticized the mainstream media's coverage of the story. He also stated that it would take a long time for the mainstream media to recover its credibility. Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, also praised Mueller's office for correcting the false story and criticized the press for their "hysterical desire to destroy" the President. BuzzFeed, meanwhile, defended its reporting, stating that it remains confident in its story. 

END OF SUMMARY.
