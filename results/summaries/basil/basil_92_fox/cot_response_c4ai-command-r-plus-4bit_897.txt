SUMMARY: President Trump denounced a BuzzFeed news report claiming he directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow as a "disgrace to journalism". He praised FBI special counsel Robert Mueller for releasing a statement disputing parts of the story, stating that the media's "hysterical desire to destroy this President has gone too far". The article claimed Cohen had admitted to Mueller that Trump told him to lie, but Mueller's office called BuzzFeed's description "not accurate". Democrats hinted at impeachment proceedings, but Mueller's rare statement disputed the article. BuzzFeed stands by its reporting, yet Trump's team denied the claims, with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani commending Mueller for "correcting the BuzzFeed false story". A BuzzFeed spokesman reaffirmed their confidence in their reporting, stating they have "seen no indication that any specific aspect of our story is inaccurate". Trump deemed the controversy "a great day for our country", while condemning the media's credibility. 
END OF SUMMARY.
