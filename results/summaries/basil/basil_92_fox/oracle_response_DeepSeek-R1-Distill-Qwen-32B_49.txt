Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the article's content. It's about President Trump reacting to a Buzzfeed story regarding Michael Cohen lying to Congress about the Trump Tower in Moscow. The key points are Trump's criticism of Buzzfeed and the media, Mueller's office disputing the story, and the back-and-forth between Buzzfeed and Trump's team.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. They include words like "claiming," "story," "statement," "appropriate," "lie," "dealings," "description," "statements," "accurate," "correcting," "destroy," "gone," "reconfirmed," "reported." I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I'll start by outlining the main events: Buzzfeed's story, Trump's response, Mueller's statement, Buzzfeed's defense, and the implications on media credibility. I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise.

I should structure the summary to reflect the moral judgment from Trump's perspective, emphasizing his criticism of Buzzfeed and the media's credibility. Also, highlight Mueller's rare move to dispute the story and the ongoing conflict between Buzzfeed and Trump's team.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes all necessary morally framed words without making it too verbose. Let me draft it, then check the word count and the inclusion of the key terms.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized a Buzzfeed article claiming he directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump Tower project, calling it a "disgrace to journalism" and the media's credibility. Trump thanked Robert Mueller's office for releasing a statement disputing the article, calling it "appropriate." Buzzfeed's story, based on Cohen's testimony, described Trump explicitly telling Cohen to lie about his dealings with Russia, marking a significant development. Mueller's office denied Buzzfeed's description of Cohen's statements and characterization of documents, though it did not provide further details. Buzzfeed defended its reporting, stating it stood by its sources and urged Mueller to clarify. Trump's team, including his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, praised Mueller's office for "correcting" the "false story," while Buzzfeed's spokesperson reaffirmed the article's accuracy. The controversy highlights tensions between the administration and the media, with Trump labeling it a "sad day for journalism" but a "great day for our country." END OF SUMMARY.
