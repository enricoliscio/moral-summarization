SUMMARY:

President Trump praised Special Counsel Robert Mueller for releasing a statement disputing parts of a BuzzFeed news report claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the BuzzFeed article a "total phony story" and a "disgrace to our country" and "journalism". Mueller's office rarely issues statements, but did so in this case, saying that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were "not accurate". BuzzFeed stood by its reporting and sources, urging Mueller to clarify what he's disputing. Trump's team also denied the claims, with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani praising Mueller's office for "correcting the Buzzfeed false story". The controversy has sparked a heated debate over the credibility of the media and the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election.

END OF SUMMARY.
