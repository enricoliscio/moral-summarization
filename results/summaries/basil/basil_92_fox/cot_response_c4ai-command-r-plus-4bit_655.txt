SUMMARY: President Trump praised FBI special counsel Robert Mueller for disputing a BuzzFeed news report, which claimed that Trump directed his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the BuzzFeed story a "disgrace" and criticized the mainstream media for their "disgraceful" coverage, stating that their credibility has been severely damaged. BuzzFeed's article, citing law enforcement sources, alleged that Cohen told Mueller's office that Trump instructed him to lie, which would be a significant development in the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mueller's office, in an unusual move, released a statement disputing the accuracy of BuzzFeed's description of Cohen's testimony. Trump's team, including lawyer Rudy Giuliani, also denounced the claims in the article, with Giuliani commending Mueller's office for "correcting the Buzzfeed false story." BuzzFeed, however, stood by its reporting, stating that it remains "confident" in its story despite the special counsel's denial. This incident highlights the contentious relationship between the Trump administration and the media, with Trump often criticizing news outlets for their coverage of his presidency. END OF SUMMARY.
