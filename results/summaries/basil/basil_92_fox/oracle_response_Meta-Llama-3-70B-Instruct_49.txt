SUMMARY:

President Trump appreciated special counsel Robert Mueller's statement disputing parts of a BuzzFeed news report, which Trump called a "total phony story" and a "disgrace to our country" and "journalism". The report claimed Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the timing of discussions over a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were "not accurate". Trump praised Mueller's office for "correcting the Buzzfeed false story", saying it was a "great day for our country". However, BuzzFeed stood by its reporting and sources, urging Mueller to clarify what he was disputing. Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani also praised Mueller's office, saying the press's "hysterical desire to destroy this President has gone too far". The controversy highlights the issue of credibility, with Trump saying the mainstream media has "lost tremendous credibility".

END OF SUMMARY.
