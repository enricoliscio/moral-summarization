Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about President Trump reacting to a BuzzFeed story. The story claims Trump told his attorney, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump Tower project. Trump appreciates Robert Mueller's statement disputing the report. He calls the Buzzfeed piece and media coverage disgraceful and says the media lost credibility.

BuzzFeed's story is based on two law enforcement sources. It says Cohen admitted to Mueller's office that Trump told him to lie about the timing of the Moscow deal. This is the first time Trump is alleged to have explicitly told someone to lie about Russia dealings. They also reported Trump planned to visit Russia during the campaign to meet Putin.

Mueller's office rarely comments but issued a statement saying Buzzfeed's description and characterization were inaccurate. Buzzfeed stands by their reporting, and Trump's team denies the claims. Trump's lawyer, Giuliani, supports Mueller's correction and criticizes the press. Buzzfeed's spokesman says they've reconfirmed their reporting and see no inaccuracies.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Trump's appreciation of Mueller's statement, mention the Buzzfeed claims, Trump's criticism of the media, Mueller's response, Buzzfeed's defense, and Trump's team's denial.

Make sure to include key points: Trump's reaction, Buzzfeed's allegations, Mueller's rare statement, Buzzfeed's defense, and Trump's team's denial. Keep it concise and clear.
