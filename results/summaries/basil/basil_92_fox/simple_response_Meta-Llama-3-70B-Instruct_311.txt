SUMMARY:

President Trump praised Robert Mueller's office for disputing a BuzzFeed news report that claimed Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the report a "total phony story" and a "disgrace to our country" and "journalism". He also criticized the mainstream media's coverage of the story, saying it has lost credibility. The report claimed that Cohen told Mueller's office that Trump told him to lie about the project, but Mueller's office disputed the article, saying the characterization of documents and testimony was not accurate. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, urging Mueller's office to clarify what it disputed. Trump's team, including lawyer Rudy Giuliani, also denied the claims. The incident highlights the ongoing media scrutiny of Trump's actions and the importance of accurate reporting.
