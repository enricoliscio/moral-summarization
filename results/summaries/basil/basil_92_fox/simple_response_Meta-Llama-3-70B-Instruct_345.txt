SUMMARY:

President Trump praised Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office for disputing a BuzzFeed news report claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the report "a total phony story" and "a disgrace to our country" and "journalism", and criticized the mainstream media's coverage as "disgraceful". Mueller's office rarely issues statements, but did so in this case, stating that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were "not accurate". Trump's team and lawyer Rudy Giuliani also denied the claims, with Giuliani saying the press's "hysterical desire to destroy this President has gone too far". BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, saying it saw no indication that any specific aspect of its story was inaccurate.

END OF SUMMARY.
