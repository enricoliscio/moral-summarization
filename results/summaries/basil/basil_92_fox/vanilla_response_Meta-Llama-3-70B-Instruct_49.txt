SUMMARY:

President Trump has appreciated the statement released by FBI special counsel Robert Mueller's office, which disputes parts of a BuzzFeed news report claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the timing of discussions over a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the BuzzFeed report "a total phony story" and a "disgrace to our country" and "journalism". He also criticized the mainstream media's coverage of the story, saying it has lost credibility. The BuzzFeed report cited two law enforcement officials who said Cohen acknowledged to Mueller's office that he was told to lie to Congress about the potential real-estate deal in Moscow. Mueller's office rarely issues statements about the state of the investigation, but took the extraordinary step of releasing a statement disputing the article. Both Trump's team and BuzzFeed have stood by their reporting, with BuzzFeed saying they've seen no indication that any specific aspect of their story is inaccurate.

END OF SUMMARY.
