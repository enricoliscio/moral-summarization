SUMMARY: President Trump denounced a BuzzFeed report claiming he directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow, calling it a "disgrace to journalism." The article cited sources stating that Cohen told Mueller's office that Trump instructed him to lie, but Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's characterization of their evidence. Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani praised Mueller's office for refuting the report, criticizing the media's negative portrayal of the President. BuzzFeed, however, stands by its reporting. This incident highlights the ethical dilemma between freedom of the press and responsible, factual reporting, with potential repercussions for national security and the public trust. The media has a moral obligation to report truthfully, especially in politically sensitive matters, as false accusations can damage reputations and erode trust in journalism as a whole.
