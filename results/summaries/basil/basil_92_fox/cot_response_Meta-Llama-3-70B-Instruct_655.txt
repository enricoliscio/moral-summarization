SUMMARY:
President Trump praised special counsel Robert Mueller for releasing a statement disputing parts of a BuzzFeed news report claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. Trump called the BuzzFeed piece a "total phony story" and a "disgrace to our country" and "journalism". He also criticized the mainstream media's coverage, saying it was "disgraceful" and has "lost tremendous credibility". Mueller's office rarely issues statements, but took the extraordinary step of disputing the article, saying BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were "not accurate". Trump's team and lawyer Rudy Giuliani also denied the claims, with Giuliani praising Mueller's office for "correcting the Buzzfeed false story". BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, saying it saw no indication that any specific aspect of its story was inaccurate. END OF SUMMARY.
