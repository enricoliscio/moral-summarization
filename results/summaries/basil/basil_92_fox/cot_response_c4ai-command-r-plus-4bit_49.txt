SUMMARY:
Trump praised Robert Mueller's decision to issue a statement disputing a BuzzFeed News report that claimed Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the BuzzFeed piece a "disgrace" and a "phony story," criticizing the mainstream media's coverage of it as "disgraceful." The article alleged that Cohen had testified to Mueller that Trump explicitly told him to lie, which would be a significant development in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mueller's office rarely issues statements, but took the extraordinary step of disputing the BuzzFeed report, stating that their "description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony" were inaccurate. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, while Trump's team, including lawyer Rudy Giuliani, praised Mueller's correction and criticized the media for its "hysterical desire to destroy this President." The controversy has raised questions about the credibility of the media and the implications for Trump's presidency. 

END OF SUMMARY.
