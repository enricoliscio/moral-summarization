SUMMARY: President Trump expressed his appreciation for FBI special counsel Robert Mueller's statement disputing a BuzzFeed news report that claimed Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the BuzzFeed piece a "disgrace to journalism" and criticized the mainstream media's coverage of the story. He also praised Mueller's team for releasing a statement disputing the article, which claimed that Cohen's testimony marked a "significant new frontier" in the investigation into Trump's dealings with Russia. Mueller's office rarely issues public statements, but took the extraordinary step of disputing BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterizations of documents and testimony. BuzzFeed, however, stood by its reporting and urged Mueller to clarify his dispute. Trump's team denied the claims in the article, with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani praising Mueller's office for "correcting the BuzzFeed false story." BuzzFeed, in turn, defended its reporting and stated that it remained confident in its accuracy.
END OF SUMMARY.
