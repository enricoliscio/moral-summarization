Alright, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

The article is about President Trump reacting to a Buzzfeed story. The story claims Trump told his attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow project. Trump is upset and calls the story a "disgrace" to journalism. He appreciates Mueller's statement disputing Buzzfeed's claims. 

I need to make sure the summary includes the morally charged words like "claiming," "story," "disgrace," "lie," "coverage," etc. I should structure the summary to show Trump's strong reaction, Buzzfeed's stance, Mueller's rare move, and the implications on media credibility.

I'll start by stating Trump's appreciation for Mueller's statement. Then mention the Buzzfeed story and its claims. Highlight Trump's criticism of the story and media coverage. Include Mueller's correction and Buzzfeed's response. Conclude with the impact on media credibility.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure all the key moral terms are included. Let me draft that now.

SUMMARY: President Trump expressed appreciation for FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller's statement disputing a Buzzfeed article claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump Tower project. Trump criticized the "phony story," calling it a "disgrace" to journalism and the country, and accused the mainstream media of losing credibility. Buzzfeed's article, based on two law enforcement officials, alleged Cohen admitted to Mueller's office that Trump told him to mislead Congress about the deal's timeline to conceal Trump's involvement. It also claimed Trump planned to visit Russia during the campaign to negotiate the project. Mueller's office rarely comments but issued a rare statement, saying Buzzfeed's description of Cohen's testimony and related documents was inaccurate. Buzzfeed defended its reporting, stating it stands by its sources and reporting. Trump's team denied the claims, with Trump calling the controversy a "sad day for journalism" but a "great day for our country." Mueller's office was praised by Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani for "correcting" Buzzfeed's "false story." Buzzfeed reiterated its confidence in the reporting, stating it had "re-confirmed" its sources and found no inaccuracies. END OF SUMMARY.
