SUMMARY: President Trump expressed his appreciation for FBI special counsel Robert Mueller's statement disputing a BuzzFeed news report that claimed Trump instructed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the BuzzFeed piece a "disgrace to journalism" and criticized the mainstream media's coverage of it. BuzzFeed's article cited sources claiming Cohen told Mueller that Trump directed him to lie, but Mueller's office issued a rare statement disputing the accuracy of the report. BuzzFeed's editor-in-chief defended the reporting, while Trump's team, including lawyer Rudy Giuliani, praised Mueller's correction. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, stating that they have seen no indication of inaccuracy in their story. Trump's response to the controversy characterized it as a "sad day for journalism."

END OF SUMMARY.
