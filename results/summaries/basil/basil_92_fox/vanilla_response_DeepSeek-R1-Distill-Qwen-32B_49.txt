Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's response to a BuzzFeed report. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, the article starts by mentioning that President Trump appreciates Robert Mueller's statement disputing a BuzzFeed report. The report claimed Trump told Michael Cohen to lie about the Moscow project. Trump called the story a disgrace to journalism and the country, and criticized the mainstream media's coverage.

BuzzFeed's story cited two law enforcement officials saying Cohen admitted to lying about the timing of the Moscow deal to hide Trump's involvement. They also reported that Trump planned to visit Russia during the campaign to meet Putin. Mueller's office rarely comments but released a statement saying BuzzFeed's description and characterization were inaccurate.

Trump's team denied the claims, with Trump calling it a sad day for journalism but a good day for the country. His lawyer, Giuliani, praised Mueller for correcting the story. BuzzFeed's editor stood by their reporting, and their spokesman said they saw no inaccuracies and would share more details if possible.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key points: Trump's appreciation of Mueller's statement, theBuzzFeed report's claims, Mueller's response, Trump's criticism of media, and the ongoing debate between BuzzFeed and Trump's team.

I'll structure it by first stating Trump's reaction, then the content of the BuzzFeed report, Mueller's response, and the subsequent reactions from both sides. Make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.

Let me check the word count as I go. Okay, I think this covers all the essential elements without going over the limit.
