SUMMARY:

President Trump praised Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office for disputing a BuzzFeed news report claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the report a "total phony story" and a "disgrace to our country" and "journalism." He also criticized the mainstream media's coverage of the story, saying it will take a long time for them to recover their credibility. Mueller's office rarely issues statements, but did so in this case, saying BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were not accurate. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting and sources, and Trump's team denied the claims. The incident highlights the ongoing battle between Trump and the media, with Trump accusing them of having a "hysterical desire to destroy" him.

END OF SUMMARY.
