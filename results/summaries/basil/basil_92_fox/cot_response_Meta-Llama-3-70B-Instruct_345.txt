SUMMARY:
President Trump appreciated the FBI special counsel Robert Mueller's statement disputing parts of a BuzzFeed news report claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. Trump called the BuzzFeed piece a "disgrace to our country" and a "disgrace to journalism", and stated that the mainstream media's coverage was "disgraceful" and has "lost tremendous credibility". Mueller's office rarely issues statements, but took the extraordinary step of releasing a statement disputing the article, saying that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were "not accurate". Trump's team and lawyer Rudy Giuliani also denied the claims, with Giuliani praising Mueller's office for "correcting the Buzzfeed false story". BuzzFeed stood by their reporting, but the controversy has sparked a debate about journalism and credibility. END OF SUMMARY.
