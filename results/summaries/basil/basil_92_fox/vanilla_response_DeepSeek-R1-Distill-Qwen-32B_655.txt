Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump reacting to a BuzzFeed report. The report claims that Trump told Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump Tower project. Trump is appreciative that Robert Mueller's office released a statement disputing the BuzzFeed article. He called the story and its coverage a disgrace to journalism and the country. 

BuzzFeed's story was based on two law enforcement officials who said Cohen admitted to Mueller's office that he lied about the timing of the Moscow deal to hide Trump's involvement. It's the first time Trump explicitly told someone to lie about his dealings with Russia. They also reported that Trump planned to visit Russia during the campaign to meet Putin. 

Mueller's office rarely comments, but they released a statement saying BuzzFeed's description and characterization were inaccurate. They didn't provide details. BuzzFeed's editor stands by their reporting, and Trump's team denied the claims. Trump and his lawyer praised Mueller's office for correcting the story. BuzzFeed's spokesperson defended their reporting, saying they've reconfirmed it and see no inaccuracies.

So, the key points are: Trump appreciates Mueller's statement against BuzzFeed's report. The report claims Trump directed Cohen to lie about Moscow deal. Mueller's office says the report's description and characterization are inaccurate. BuzzFeed stands by their story. Trump and his team deny the claims. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's appreciation, mention the BuzzFeed report's claims, Mueller's response, and the ongoing dispute. I'll make sure to include the main elements without getting too detailed.
