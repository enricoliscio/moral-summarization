Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about President Trump reacting to a Buzzfeed news report. Buzzfeed claimed that Trump told his attorney, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump Tower project. Trump is appreciative that Robert Mueller's office released a statement disputing the Buzzfeed story. He called the Buzzfeed piece and the media coverage a disgrace and said it hurt the media's credibility.

Buzzfeed's story was based on two law enforcement officials saying Cohen admitted to Mueller's office that Trump told him to lie. It was the first time Trump was directly accused of telling someone to lie about his Russia dealings. Mueller's office rarely comments, but they did this time, saying Buzzfeed's description wasn't accurate. Buzzfeed's editor stands by their reporting, and Trump's team denied the claims. Trump's lawyer also criticized the media for going too far.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's appreciation for Mueller's statement. Then mention the Buzzfeed story's claims, Mueller's response, and the reactions from both Buzzfeed and Trump's side. I'll make sure to include key points: the lie about the Moscow project, the significance of Cohen's testimony, Mueller's rare statement, Buzzfeed's defense, and Trump's criticism of the media. I'll keep it concise and ensure all main elements are covered without getting too detailed.
