SUMMARY: President Trump expressed his appreciation for FBI special counsel Robert Mueller's statement disputing a BuzzFeed news article that claimed Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the BuzzFeed piece a "disgrace to journalism" and criticized the mainstream media's coverage of the story, stating that it would take a long time for their credibility to recover. The article alleged that Cohen's testimony provided evidence of Trump explicitly telling a subordinate to lie about his dealings with Russia, but Mueller's office disputed BuzzFeed's description and characterization of statements made to the special counsel's office. Trump's team denied the claims, with Trump calling it a "great day for our country" that the story was proven false. BuzzFeed, however, stands by its reporting, stating that they have reconfirmed their sources and found no inaccuracies.

END OF SUMMARY.
