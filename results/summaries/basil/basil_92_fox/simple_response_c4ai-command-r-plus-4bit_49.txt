SUMMARY: President Trump praised FBI special counsel Robert Mueller for disputing a BuzzFeed news report which claimed Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the report a "disgrace to journalism" and criticized the mainstream media's coverage of the story, stating that it would take a long time for their credibility to recover. BuzzFeed's article, citing law enforcement officials, alleged that Cohen had admitted to Mueller's office that Trump told him to lie, and that this represented a "significant new frontier" in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mueller's office, which rarely issues public statements, took the extraordinary step of disputing the article, stating that BuzzFeed's description and characterization of documents and testimony were "not accurate". While Trump and his team denied the claims, BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, stating that it remained confident in its story. This incident highlights the ethical dilemma between protecting sources and the public's right to know, with potential consequences for the credibility of the media and the integrity of the investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
