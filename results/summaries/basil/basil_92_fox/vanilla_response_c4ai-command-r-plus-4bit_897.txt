BuzzFeed's editor-in-chief defended the reporting and urged Mueller to clarify what was being disputed. Trump criticized the BuzzFeed piece as a "disgrace to journalism" and criticized the mainstream media's coverage of it. Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, also praised Mueller's office for correcting the story and criticized the press for their "hysterical desire to destroy" Trump. BuzzFeed, meanwhile, doubled down on its reporting, stating that it remains confident in its story and will continue to stand by its reporting.
