SUMMARY: President Trump expressed his appreciation for FBI special counsel Robert Mueller's statement disputing a BuzzFeed news article that claimed Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the BuzzFeed article a "disgrace to journalism" and criticized the mainstream media's coverage of the story. The article alleged that Cohen's testimony provided evidence of Trump explicitly telling a subordinate to lie about his dealings with Russia. However, Mueller's office released a rare statement disputing the accuracy of BuzzFeed's description and characterization of statements made to the special counsel's office. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, while Trump and his team, including lawyer Rudy Giuliani, denounced the article and praised Mueller's correction. The controversy has sparked discussions about journalistic ethics and the credibility of the mainstream media.
