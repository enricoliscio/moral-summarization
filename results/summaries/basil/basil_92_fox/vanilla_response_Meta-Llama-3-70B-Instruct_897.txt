SUMMARY:

President Trump has expressed appreciation for special counsel Robert Mueller's office disputing a BuzzFeed news report claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Trump called the report "a total phony story" and criticized the mainstream media's coverage, saying it has lost credibility. The BuzzFeed article, citing two law enforcement officials, stated that Cohen acknowledged to Mueller's office that he was told to lie about the project's timeline. However, Mueller's office released a rare statement disputing the article, saying the characterization of documents and testimony was not accurate. Both Trump's team and BuzzFeed have stood by their claims, with BuzzFeed urging Mueller's office to clarify what it disputes. The controversy has sparked a heated debate about journalism and credibility.
