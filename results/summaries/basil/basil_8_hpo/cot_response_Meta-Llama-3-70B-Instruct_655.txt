SUMMARY:
Senior White House officials have raised the stakes in the tax cut debate, warning that inaction would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers offered a "dire" assessment, stating that if Democrats don't pass the bill in the next couple of weeks, it would "materially increase the risk" of a double dip. However, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official, provided a more "sober-minded" analysis, saying that a wait of a month or two would not cause a double dip, but rather a "contractionary" fiscal policy would. The White House is selling the deal to Democrats, who are "skeptical" about extending Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and a generous revision of the estate tax. The administration's pitch is to take the package now or risk being "blamed" for an economic downturn, highlighting the "real consequences" of inaction. END OF SUMMARY.
