Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that the summary should include the morally framed words: increase, stall, help, dipping, stabilize, fails, facing.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about senior White House officials pressuring Democrats to pass Bush tax cuts, warning that inaction could lead to a double dip recession. Larry Summers emphasized the risk, while others like Rob Shapiro provided a more cautious analysis. The White House is pushing the deal, highlighting the consequences of delay, such as tax increases and loss of unemployment benefits.

I need to make sure the summary includes all the specified words. I'll start by outlining the key points: the warning about increasing the risk of a double dip, the potential stalling of the economy, the help from the tax cuts, the dipping towards economic problems, the need to stabilize the housing market, the failure of the deal, and the facing of consequences.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the warning, then the debate, the consequences, and the White House's push. I'll make sure each morally framed word is naturally integrated.

I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. Let me draft it and then review to include all the required words and maintain the moral tone.

SUMMARY: Senior White House officials have warned that inaction on the Bush tax cuts significantly increases the risk of a double dip recession, urging congressional Democrats to act quickly. Larry Summers emphasized that failing to pass the bill would materially increase the risk of the economy stalling, while others, like Rob Shapiro, argued that a delay would not cause a double dip but stressed the need for a more stimulative approach. The administration is pushing for the deal, highlighting its potential to help the economy and prevent a dip into economic stagnation. However, stabilizing the housing market, a critical factor, is not part of the current plan. The White House is warning that without the deal, the economy faces real consequences, such as tax increases and the loss of unemployment benefits. The message is clear: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn. The debate over whether to fight for a better deal or accept the current compromise is framed as a choice between facing difficult consequences or securing modest help for the economy. END OF SUMMARY.
