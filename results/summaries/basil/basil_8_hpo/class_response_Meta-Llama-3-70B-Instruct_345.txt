SUMMARY:

Senior White House officials are warning congressional Democrats that inaction on the Bush tax cuts will "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession, which could stall the economy. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers cautioned that failing to pass the bill in the next couple of weeks would "materially increase the risk" of an economic downturn. However, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official, offered a more sober analysis, stating that a double dip would come from a contractionary fiscal policy, not from a short delay in passing the tax cut package. The deal, while stimulative, is not enough to lift the economy to a different place, and stabilizing housing prices is crucial to avert a return to slow growth. The White House is urging Democrats to take the package now, warning that failing to do so will lead to increased taxes and loss of unemployment insurance, and ultimately, facing a really difficult situation.
