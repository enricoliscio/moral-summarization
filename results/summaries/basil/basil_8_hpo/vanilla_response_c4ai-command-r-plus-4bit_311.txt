SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats that failing to pass the Bush tax cuts deal promptly could lead to a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, stated that inaction would "significantly increase the risk" of an economic downturn. The message was a strong pitch to Democrats skeptical about extending tax cuts for the wealthy and revising the estate tax. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and senior adviser David Axelrod emphasized the potential consequences of delaying the deal, arguing that the current agreement offers significant benefits for the economy and Americans. They also highlighted the risks of increased taxes and reduced unemployment benefits if no action is taken. The White House's strategy was to urge Democrats to accept the package now rather than risk an economic downturn and shoulder the blame. However, stabilizing the housing market, a critical factor in averting a double-dip recession, was not part of the congressional agenda. The summary of the news article emphasizes the White House's push for swift action on the tax cuts deal to prevent economic fallout, despite opposition from some Democrats.
