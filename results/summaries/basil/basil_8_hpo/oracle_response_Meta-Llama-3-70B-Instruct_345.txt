SUMMARY:

Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats that inaction on the Bush tax cuts would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers stated that if Democrats don't pass the bill in the next couple of weeks, it would "materially increase the risk" of the economy stalling out. This dire assessment was met with skepticism by some experts, who argued that a double dip recession would not be caused by waiting a month or two to pass the tax cut package. Instead, they pointed to the need to stabilize housing prices to avert slow growth. The White House began a robust process of selling the deal to Democrats, who are skeptical about extending Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and revising the estate tax. The administration's pitch was clear: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn, and potentially lose unemployment insurance for 2 million people.
