SUMMARY:
The White House has raised the stakes in the tax cut debate, warning that inaction would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers offered a dire assessment, stating that if Democrats don't pass the bill in the next couple of weeks, it would "materially increase the risk" of the economy stalling out. However, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official, offered a more sober-minded analysis, saying that a double dip would come from a contractionary fiscal policy, not from waiting a month or two to pass the tax cut package. The White House is selling the deal to Democrats, who are skeptical about an extension of Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and a generous revision of the estate tax. The administration's pitch is to take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn, with senior adviser David Axelrod warning of "real consequences" if the agreement fails.
