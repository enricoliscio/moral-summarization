SUMMARY: Senior White House officials cautioned congressional Democrats about the dangers of inaction on the Bush tax cuts, arguing that failing to pass the deal could "significantly increase the risk" of a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, warned that delaying the deal would "materially increase the risk" of an economic downturn, with potentially dire consequences. Rob Shapiro, a former Clinton administration official, offered a more nuanced perspective, acknowledging that while a double dip was unlikely in the short term, the deal was necessary to boost growth and prevent a return to slow growth once the stimulus ends. The White House faced challenges in selling the deal to skeptical Democrats, particularly regarding extensions for the wealthy and revisions to the estate tax. The administration's pitch emphasized the potential risks of inaction, highlighting the immediate consequences of tax increases and unemployment insurance losses. David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs underscored the urgency of the situation, questioning the wisdom of delaying the deal and emphasizing the need for swift action to support the economy.
