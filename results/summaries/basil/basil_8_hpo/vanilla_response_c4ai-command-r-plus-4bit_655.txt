SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats that failure to pass the Bush tax cuts deal promptly could lead to a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, stressed the urgency of passing the deal within weeks to prevent an economic downturn. The message was a stark one, though debatable, as Summers himself previously downplayed the importance of extending the tax cuts for the wealthy. The White House began aggressively selling the deal to skeptical Democrats, emphasizing the potential consequences of inaction. Robert Gibbs, White House Press Secretary, suggested that any changes to the deal should not result in decreased support, acknowledging the challenging political dynamics. David Axelrod, senior adviser, highlighted the trade-offs and emphasized the need to act now rather than risk economic fallout and increased taxes for Americans. Gibbs questioned the logic of delaying the deal, arguing that it would not lead to a better agreement. The administration's pitch to Democrats was clear: accept the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn.
END OF SUMMARY.
