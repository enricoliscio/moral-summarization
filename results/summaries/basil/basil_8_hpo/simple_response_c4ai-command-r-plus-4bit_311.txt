SUMMARY: Senior White House officials issued a stark warning to congressional Democrats, arguing that failure to pass the Bush tax cuts deal would heighten the risk of a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, a senior economic adviser, stated that inaction would "materially increase the risk" of an economic downturn. The White House began a vigorous effort to sell the deal to skeptical Democrats, who oppose extending tax cuts for the wealthy and modifying the estate tax. The administration's pitch emphasized the potential economic fallout if the deal fell through, with David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs highlighting the negative consequences of delay. However, critics argued that stabilizing the housing market was a more crucial factor in preventing an economic downturn, and questioned the urgency of passing the tax cuts deal. The White House was reluctant to make revisions to the deal, fearing a loss of support. The moral dilemma here is between the potential economic harm caused by delaying or altering the deal versus the ethical concerns of providing tax cuts to the wealthy and modifying the estate tax. The White House argued that the benefits to the economy and the American people outweighed the ethical concerns, while skeptics believed that the deal's potential drawbacks warranted further consideration.
END OF SUMMARY.
