Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The author used specific morally charged words: inaction, pass, help, on, selling, up, lose. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about senior White House officials pressuring congressional Democrats to pass the Bush tax cuts. They're warning that inaction could lead to a double dip recession. Larry Summers is mentioned as a key figure, saying that not passing the bill would increase the risk of the economy stalling. There's also a debate about the effectiveness of the tax cuts, with some arguing they're not enough and others downplaying the risks of delay.

The article mentions that stabilizing the housing market isn't on the congressional agenda, and the White House is trying to sell the deal to Democrats who are skeptical about extending tax cuts for the wealthy. The administration is emphasizing the consequences of not passing the bill, like increased taxes and loss of unemployment insurance.

I need to include the morally framed words. "Inaction" is a key point, as the officials warn against it. "Pass" is used in the context of the bill. "Help" is mentioned regarding the economy. "On" is part of phrases like "on the other side of the ledger." "Selling" the deal is another point. "Up" in the sense of taxes going up. "Lose" in terms of losing unemployment benefits.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the pressure from the White House, the consequences of inaction, and the moral framing words. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure each of those words is included naturally.

Let me draft the summary step by step. Start with the pressure from White House officials. Mention the warning about inaction leading to a double dip. Include Larry Summers' dire assessment. Then talk about the debate over the effectiveness. Mention the selling of the deal and the consequences of not passing it, like taxes going up and losing unemployment. End with the administration's emphasis on real consequences.

I think that covers all the points and includes the moral words. Now, I'll make sure it's all within 200 words and flows well.

SUMMARY: Senior White House officials are urging congressional Democrats to pass the Bush tax cuts, warning that inaction could significantly increase the risk of a double dip recession. Larry Summers emphasized that failing to pass the bill would materially increase the risk of economic stagnation. While some argue the tax cuts are stimulative, others, like Rob Shapiro, caution that the deal isn't enough to lift the economy and stress the importance of stabilizing housing prices, which isn't currently on the congressional agenda. The White House is actively selling the deal to skeptical Democrats, highlighting the consequences of delay, such as increased taxes and the loss of unemployment insurance. Senior adviser David Axelrod stressed that without the deal, the country faces a difficult situation, and the administration is emphasizing the real consequences of inaction. END OF SUMMARY.
