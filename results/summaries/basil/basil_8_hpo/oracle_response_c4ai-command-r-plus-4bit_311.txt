SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats of the consequences of inaction on the Bush tax cuts, arguing that failing to pass the deal could "significantly increase the risk" of a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating that delaying the deal would materially increase the risk of the economy stalling and entering a second recession. While the White House pushed for the deal, some questioned the accuracy of such dire predictions. Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official, acknowledged the deal's potential stimulatory effect but highlighted the need to stabilize housing prices as a more crucial factor in averting a recession. The administration's pitch to Democrats emphasized the potential blame for an economic downturn if they failed to pass the package. David Axelrod, senior adviser, questioned the endgame and consequences of delaying the deal, highlighting the real-world impacts of increased taxes and expiring unemployment benefits for millions. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs also challenged the idea of prolonging the debate, arguing that a future compromise would not be better than the current agreement. The White House's message was clear: passing the deal was essential to help the economy and avoid negative repercussions.
END OF SUMMARY.
