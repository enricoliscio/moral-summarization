SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats that failing to pass the Bush tax cuts deal would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, stated that inaction would "materially increase the risk" of an economic downturn. The message was clear: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic crisis. David Axelrod, senior adviser, emphasized the potential consequences of delaying the decision, pointing out that forecasts would worsen without action. Robert Gibbs, White House Press Secretary, also questioned the logic of those advocating for an eight-week fight, suggesting that no better agreement would be reached. The White House's pitch to Democrats was a tough sell, given their skepticism about extending tax cuts for the wealthy and revising the estate tax. However, the administration emphasized the significant benefits for the economy and people's well-being, arguing that the deal was necessary to avoid a "really difficult situation." The challenge was to balance the benefits of the deal with the unpopular provisions, and the White House was open to revisions as long as they didn't decrease support for the package.
END OF SUMMARY.
