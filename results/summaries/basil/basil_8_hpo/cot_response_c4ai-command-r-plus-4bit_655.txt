SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats of the dire consequences of inaction on the Bush tax cuts, arguing that it would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The message was clear: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasized the dangers of waiting, stating that inaction would materially increase the risk of the economy stalling. David Axelrod, senior adviser, asked skeptics to consider the end game and the consequences of playing it out. Robert Gibbs, White House Press Secretary, echoed this sentiment, questioning the wisdom of a prolonged fight and suggesting that the current agreement is the best compromise possible. The administration's pitch to the rest of the party highlighted the difficult situation ahead if no action is taken. The message emphasized the risks and potential blame for any economic downturn, framing the debate as a moral struggle between action and inaction, with serious consequences for the American people.
