SUMMARY:

Senior White House officials have warned congressional Democrats that failing to pass a deal on the Bush tax cuts could significantly increase the risk of a double dip recession. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers stated that if the bill is not passed in the next couple of weeks, it would "materially increase the risk" of the economy stalling out and entering a double dip recession. However, other experts, such as Rob Shapiro, disagree, saying that a double dip would not be caused by a short delay in passing the tax cut package. The White House is pushing Democrats to pass the deal, warning that inaction would lead to economic downturn and blaming them for the consequences. The administration is offering a take-it-or-leave-it approach, with few concessions, and warning that waiting would lead to increased taxes and loss of unemployment insurance for millions.
