SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats that failing to pass the Bush tax cuts deal promptly would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, stated that inaction would "materially increase the risk" of an economic downturn. The White House began a robust effort to sell the deal to skeptical Democrats, arguing that the benefits of the package outweighed the unpopular provisions. David Axelrod, senior adviser, and Robert Gibbs, White House Press Secretary, emphasized the consequences of delay, suggesting that the current agreement was the best option available. They argued that a prolonged fight would not result in a better deal and that the economic risks were too great to ignore. The White House's message highlighted the moral responsibility of Congress to act swiftly and avoid potential harm to the economy and the well-being of the American people.
