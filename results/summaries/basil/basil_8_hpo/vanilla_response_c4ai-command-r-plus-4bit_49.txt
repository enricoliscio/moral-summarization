SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats that failing to pass the Bush tax cuts deal promptly could lead to a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating that inaction would "significantly increase the risk" of an economic downturn. While some analysts debated the accuracy of this claim, the White House began aggressively selling the deal to skeptical Democrats. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs indicated that the administration was open to revisions that maintained or increased support for the deal. Senior adviser David Axelrod and Gibbs emphasized the potential economic consequences of delaying the deal, urging Democrats to consider the risks of a prolonged fight. They highlighted the benefits of the current agreement and warned that a future compromise might not be as favorable. The White House's message to Democrats was clear: accept the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn.
