SUMMARY:

Senior White House officials are warning congressional Democrats that inaction on the Bush tax cuts will "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession, which would "materially increase the risk" that the economy would stall out. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers cautioned that if the bill isn't passed in the next couple of weeks, it would increase the risk of the economy dipping towards a double dip recession. However, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official, offered a more sober-minded analysis, stating that the wait wouldn't cause a double dip, but rather a contractionary fiscal policy would. He emphasized that stabilizing housing prices is key to averting a slow growth economy. The White House is selling the deal to Democrats, warning that failure to pass the bill would lead to increased taxes and lost unemployment insurance, and that playing politics with the economy would have real consequences.
