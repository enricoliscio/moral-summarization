SUMMARY:

Senior White House officials, including Larry Summers, warned that failing to pass a deal on the Bush tax cuts would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession. Summers stated that if the bill is not passed within the next couple of weeks, it would materially increase the risk of the economy stalling out. However, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official, disagreed, saying that a double dip recession would not be caused by waiting a month or two to pass the tax cut package. The White House is pushing Democrats to pass the deal, which includes an extension of Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and a generous revision of the estate tax, warning that inaction would lead to economic downturn and blaming Democrats if the deal fails. The administration is offering few concessions, instead emphasizing the potential consequences of not passing the deal.

END OF SUMMARY.
