SUMMARY:

The White House is pressuring congressional Democrats to pass a deal on the Bush tax cuts, warning that inaction would significantly increase the risk of a double dip recession. Senior economic adviser Larry Summers stated that if the bill isn't passed within the next couple of weeks, it would "materially increase the risk" of the economy stalling out. However, experts like Rob Shapiro argue that the wait wouldn't cause a double dip, and that the deal is stimulative but not enough to lift the economy to a different place. The White House is selling the deal to Democrats, who are skeptical about extending tax cuts for the wealthy and revising the estate tax. The administration's pitch is: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn. If the deal fails, forecasts will go down, taxes will increase, and 2 million people will lose their unemployment insurance.
