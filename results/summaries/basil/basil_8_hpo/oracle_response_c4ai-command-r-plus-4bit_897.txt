SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats that inaction on the Bush tax cuts deal could "significantly increase the risk" of a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasized the urgency of passing the deal, stating that a delay would "materially increase the risk" of an economic downturn. The White House began a robust campaign to sell the deal to skeptical Democrats, who were reluctant to extend tax cuts for the wealthy and revise the estate tax. The administration's pitch emphasized the potential consequences of inaction, highlighting the risk of increased taxes and the loss of unemployment insurance for millions of Americans. David Axelrod, senior adviser, questioned the endgame of those who wanted to fight for more, asking where the battle would lead and what the consequences of delaying the deal would be. Robert Gibbs, White House Press Secretary, echoed this sentiment, suggesting that an eight-week fight would not result in a better agreement. The moral framing of the article revolves around the potential consequences of passing or not passing the tax cuts deal, with the White House arguing that inaction would have detrimental effects on the economy and Americans' well-being.
