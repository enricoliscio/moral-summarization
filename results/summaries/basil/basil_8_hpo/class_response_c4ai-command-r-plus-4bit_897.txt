SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats of the severe consequences of failing to pass the Bush tax cuts deal, arguing that inaction could "significantly increase the risk" of a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasized the urgency of the matter, stating that if Democrats don't act within the next few weeks, it would "materially increase the risk" of the economy stalling and a potential double-dip recession. The message was clear: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn. David Axelrod, senior adviser, highlighted the real-world consequences of inaction, including tax increases and the loss of unemployment insurance for millions. Robert Gibbs, White House Press Secretary, questioned the logic of delaying the decision, asking who would benefit from an eight-week fight only to come back to the same compromise. The White House's pitch to Democrats was stark: accept the deal now or face the potential consequences of an economic downturn.
