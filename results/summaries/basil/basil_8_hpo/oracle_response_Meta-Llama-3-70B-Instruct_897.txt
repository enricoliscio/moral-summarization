SUMMARY:

Senior White House officials warned that inaction on the Bush tax cuts would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession, urging Democrats to pass the deal within weeks. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers emphasized that failing to pass the bill would "materially increase the risk" of stalling the economy. While Summers previously downplayed the significance of continuing the Bush tax cuts, he now stresses the importance of passing the deal to help lower-income workers. Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official, offered a more sober analysis, stating that waiting a month or two would not cause a double dip, but the current deal is not enough to lift the economy to a different place. The White House is selling the deal to skeptical Democrats, warning that inaction would lead to increased taxes and lost unemployment insurance. The administration's pitch is to take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn.
