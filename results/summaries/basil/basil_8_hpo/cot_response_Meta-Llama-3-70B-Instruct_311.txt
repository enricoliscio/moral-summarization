SUMMARY:
The White House has raised the stakes in the tax cut debate, warning that inaction would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers offered a dire assessment, stating that if the bill isn't passed in the next couple of weeks, it would "materially increase the risk" of the economy stalling out. However, some experts, like Rob Shapiro, believe that the wait wouldn't cause a double dip, but rather a contractionary fiscal policy would. The White House is pushing for the deal, warning Democrats that if they don't pass it, they will be blamed for an economic downturn. The administration is emphasizing the consequences of inaction, including 2 million people losing their unemployment insurance and taxes going up on January 1. The deal may not be perfect, but it's better than nothing, and the White House is urging Democrats to take it to avoid a difficult situation.
