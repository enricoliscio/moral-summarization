SUMMARY: Senior White House officials issued stark warnings to congressional Democrats, cautioning that failing to pass the Bush tax cuts deal could have dire consequences for the economy. With a possible double dip recession on the line, the White House began a robust effort to sell the deal to skeptical Democrats. The pitch included both sticks and carrots, with the White House pressuring Democrats to take the deal now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn. The message was clear: there are real consequences to inaction, and the difficult reality is that the deal, though imperfect, is fundamentally better than no deal at all. END OF SUMMARY.
