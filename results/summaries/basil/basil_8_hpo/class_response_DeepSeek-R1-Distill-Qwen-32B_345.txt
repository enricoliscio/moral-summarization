Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the text and specified certain words to include. First, I need to read the article carefully to understand the main points. The article is about the Bush tax cuts and the efforts by the White House to get congressional Democrats on board. They're using strong language to push for the deal, emphasizing the risks of inaction.

I notice the author used words like "increase," "stall," "help," "dipping," "stabilize," "fails," and "facing." These words carry moral weight, so I need to include them in the summary. I should focus on the key arguments made by officials like Larry Summers and Rob Shapiro. Summers warns about the risk of a double dip recession if the bill isn't passed, while Shapiro argues that the deal isn't enough but is still stimulative.

The summary needs to be concise, around 200 words, and include those moral terms. I should structure it to highlight the pressure on Democrats, the consequences of delay, and the administration's push for the deal. Also, mention the lack of alternative options and the real consequences mentioned, like taxes going up and unemployment benefits ending.

I need to ensure the summary flows well, capturing the urgency and the differing opinions, but staying within the word limit. I'll start by stating the main point, then outline the arguments from both sides, and conclude with the administration's stance on the deal's necessity.

SUMMARY: Senior White House officials have intensified pressure on congressional Democrats to pass the Bush tax cuts, warning that inaction would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession. Larry Summers, the outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasized that failing to pass the bill would "materially increase the risk" of the economy stalling out. While Summers downplayed the significance of the tax cuts for the wealthy earlier, he now stressed the consequences of delay, including rising taxes and the loss of unemployment insurance for 2 million people. Rob Shapiro, a former Clinton administration official, argued that the wait would not cause a double dip but noted the deal is stimulative yet insufficient to lift the economy to a stronger position. Stabilizing the housing market, he said, is critical but not part of the current plan. The administration is urging Democrats to accept the deal, warning that failure to act would face real consequences, such as increased taxes and economic stagnation. The message is clear: pass the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn. END OF SUMMARY.
