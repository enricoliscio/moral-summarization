SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats of dire consequences if they failed to pass a deal on the Bush tax cuts, arguing that inaction could significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The message was clear: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn. Larry Summers, a senior economic adviser, offered a dire prediction, stating that a delay in passing the bill would materially increase the risk of an economic stall. While some debated the accuracy of this claim, the White House began a robust effort to sell the deal to skeptical Democrats, arguing that the consequences of inaction were too great. David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs emphasized the real risks of doing nothing, highlighting the potential for tax increases and the loss of unemployment insurance for millions. They urged Democrats to consider the end game and the consequences of playing it out, suggesting that a prolonged fight would not result in a better agreement. The moral framing of the message was clear: the responsibility to prevent economic harm lay with the Democrats, and any failure to act would have serious repercussions.
