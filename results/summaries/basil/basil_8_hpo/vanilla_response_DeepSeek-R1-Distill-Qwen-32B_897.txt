Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Senior White House officials trying to get Congress to pass the Bush tax cuts. They're warning that not passing the bill could lead to a double dip recession. Larry Summers, the outgoing economic adviser, says that if they don't pass it soon, the risk of the economy stalling increases. He's pretty dire about it.

But wait, earlier in September, Summers downplayed the importance of continuing the Bush tax cuts, but that was before they included extensions for unemployment insurance and other tax incentives for lower-income workers. So, maybe the current proposal is better?

Another person mentioned is Rob Shapiro, who was a commerce official under Clinton. He thinks that waiting a month or two won't cause a double dip, but the current deal isn't enough to really boost the economy. He emphasizes that stabilizing housing prices is key, but that's not part of the current plan.

The White House is pushing the deal hard, especially to Democrats who are skeptical about extending tax cuts for the wealthy and the estate tax changes. They're using a mix of threats and incentives, but not many carrots, just sticks. The press secretary, Robert Gibbs, says they're open to changes but not sure if it's worth the effort. They're basically telling Democrats to take the deal now or be blamed for the economic downturn.

David Axelrod adds that delaying the deal would lead to negative consequences like tax increases and loss of unemployment benefits. The administration believes the current deal is the best option, and delaying it would make things worse.

So, the summary needs to capture the key points: the warning about a double dip, the debate over the tax cuts, the skepticism from Democrats, the consequences of inaction, and the administration's push for the deal. I should keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise.
