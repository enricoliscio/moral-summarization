SUMMARY:

Senior White House officials have raised the stakes on congressional Democrats, warning that inaction on the Bush tax cuts would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers stated that if the bill is not passed in the next couple of weeks, it will "materially increase the risk" of the economy stalling out. However, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official, offered a more sober-minded analysis, saying that waiting a month or two to pass the tax cut package would not cause a double dip, but rather a contractionary fiscal policy would be the culprit.

The White House is selling the deal to skeptical Democrats, warning that failing to pass the bill would lead to increased taxes and lost unemployment insurance for 2 million people. Senior adviser David Axelrod emphasized that there are "real consequences" to inaction, and that the agreement, despite its flaws, would "help people and help the economy." The administration is urging Democrats to take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn.
