SUMMARY:

Senior White House officials warned that inaction on the Bush tax cuts would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession, which would stall the economy and lead to a downturn. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers stated that if Democrats don't pass the bill in the next couple of weeks, it would "materially increase the risk" of the economy stalling out. However, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official, offered a more sober-minded analysis, saying that a double dip recession would come from a contractionary fiscal policy, not from waiting a month or two to pass the tax cut package. He emphasized that stabilizing housing prices is crucial to avert a slow growth economy. The White House is selling the deal to skeptical Democrats, warning that failing to pass the package would lead to increased taxes and loss of unemployment insurance, and that there are real consequences to playing it out. The administration's pitch is to take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn.
