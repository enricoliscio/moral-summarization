SUMMARY:
Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats that inaction on the Bush tax cuts would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession, a "dire" assessment. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers stated that if the bill isn't passed within a couple of weeks, it would "materially increase the risk" of the economy stalling out. However, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official, offered a more sober-minded analysis, saying that a wait wouldn't cause a double dip, but rather a contractionary fiscal policy would. The White House began selling the deal to skeptical Democrats, warning that if they don't take the package, they would be blamed for an economic downturn. The administration's pitch was to take the deal now or risk facing "real consequences," including increased taxes and lost unemployment insurance. END OF SUMMARY.
