SUMMARY: Senior White House officials have issued a stark warning to congressional Democrats, advising them to accept the current tax cut deal or risk the "dire" consequences of a double-dip recession. The message is clear: inaction will significantly increase the "stakes" of an economic downturn, and Democrats will be blamed for it. Larry Summers, a senior economic adviser, emphasized the "danger" of delaying the deal, arguing that waiting even a month or two could materially increase the risk of a recession. The White House is now in the process of selling the deal to skeptical Democrats, urging them to accept the package as it stands rather than engaging in a "fight" that could lead to a "fundamentally" worse "agreement." David Axelrod, a senior adviser, questioned the "consequences" of delaying, highlighting the very "difficult" situation that would result from increased taxes and decreased unemployment insurance. The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, echoed this sentiment, asking who on earth would view a prolonged battle as preferable to the current "better" compromise. END OF SUMMARY.
