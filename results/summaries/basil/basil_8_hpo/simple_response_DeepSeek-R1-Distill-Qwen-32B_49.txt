Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Hmm, I need to make sure I capture the essence of the article without adding my own bias. The article is about the Bush tax cuts and the White House's push to get them passed. 

First, I should identify the main points. Senior officials are warning that not passing the tax cuts could lead to a double dip recession. Larry Summers is mentioned, saying the risk is significant. But then there's debate about whether waiting a month or two would actually cause that. Some experts, like Shapiro, argue it's more about fiscal policy. 

Also, the White House is trying to convince Democrats to support the deal, even though they're skeptical about extending tax cuts for the wealthy. There's a push for immediate action, with consequences like increased taxes and loss of unemployment benefits if they don't pass the bill. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with the White House's warning, mention Summers' comments, the debate over the risk, Shapiro's analysis, the administration's push, and the consequences if they don't act. 

Wait, I should make sure to include that the deal includes extensions for unemployment and tax incentives for lower-income workers. Also, note that stabilizing the housing market isn't part of the current plan, which is a key point. 

I need to preserve the moral framing, so highlighting the urgency and the potential consequences is important. Make sure to balance the different viewpoints without taking sides. 

Putting it all together, I'll start with the warning, mention the experts' differing opinions, the administration's strategy, and the potential negative outcomes if the deal isn't passed. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Senior White House officials have warned congressional Democrats that failing to pass the Bush tax cuts could significantly increase the risk of a double dip recession, urging immediate action to avoid economic stagnation. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasized the stakes, stating that inaction over the next few weeks could materially harm the economy. However, the significance of the tax cuts has been debated, with some, like Rob Shapiro, arguing that the risk of a double dip is more tied to broader fiscal policy rather than a short delay. The administration is pushing for the deal, which includes extensions of unemployment insurance and tax incentives for lower-income workers, while acknowledging its limitations in fully revitalizing the economy. Stabilizing the housing market, seen as crucial, is not part of the current plan. The White House is leveraging the potential consequences of inaction, such as tax increases and loss of unemployment benefits, to convince Democrats to support the deal, framing it as the lesser of two evils. END OF SUMMARY.
