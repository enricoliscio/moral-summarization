Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing words they mentioned. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Bush tax cuts and the efforts by the White House to get Congress to pass the deal. They're warning that inaction could lead to a double dip recession.

I notice the key morally framed words are increase, stall, help, dipping, stabilize, fails, facing. I need to make sure these are included in the summary. The article mentions Larry Summers warning that not passing the bill would increase the risk of the economy stalling. So I'll start by highlighting that.

Next, there's a debate about the effectiveness of the tax cuts. Some, like Rob Shapiro, argue that waiting a month or two won't cause a double dip but the deal isn't enough to stabilize the economy. I should include that the deal helps but isn't sufficient, and stabilizing housing is crucial but not part of the current plan.

The White House is pushing the deal, using the threat of facing real consequences like tax increases and loss of unemployment insurance. They're warning that failing to pass the bill now could lead to blame for an economic downturn. I'll make sure to mention that they're emphasizing the risks of inaction.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll condense each point without losing the moral framing. I'll structure it to show the White House's warnings, the debate over the deal's effectiveness, and the consequences of not acting. 

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the warnings, then the debate, and ending with the consequences. I'll use the specified moral words to maintain the author's framing. Let me put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned that failing to pass the Bush tax cut deal would significantly increase the risk of a double dip recession, emphasizing the stakes of inaction. Larry Summers stated that not passing the bill in the next few weeks would materially increase the risk of the economy stalling. While Summers downplayed the significance of the tax cuts earlier, the current deal includes provisions to help lower-income workers. Critics, like Rob Shapiro, argued that waiting a month or two would not cause a double dip but noted the deal is insufficient to stabilize the economy. The White House is urging Democrats to pass the package, warning that failure to act would face real consequences, such as tax increases and loss of unemployment insurance. They argue that delaying the deal would likely result in a worse outcome, with no guarantee of a better agreement. The administration is emphasizing the risks of inaction, urging Congress to act now to avoid blame for an economic downturn. END OF SUMMARY.
