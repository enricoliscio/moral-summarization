Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses the efforts of Senior White House officials to push Congress to pass the Bush tax cuts, warning that inaction could lead to a double dip recession. Larry Summers is mentioned as a key figure, emphasizing the risks of not passing the bill. There's a debate about whether the tax cuts would be enough to prevent a downturn, with some experts like Rob Shapiro arguing that it's not sufficient and that stabilizing the housing market is more critical.

I should note that the summary needs to be concise, no longer than 200 words, and include the moral framing. The moral aspect here is the responsibility of Congress to act to prevent economic harm. I need to highlight the stakes and the consequences as presented by the officials, while also mentioning the counterarguments about the limitations of the tax cuts.

I'll start by identifying the key points: the warning about the double dip, Summers' dire assessment, Shapiro's counterargument, the focus on unemployment and tax increases, and the administration's push for the deal without offering more incentives.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these elements, ensuring it flows logically and stays within the word limit. I'll make sure to mention the moral implications, such as the responsibility to act to prevent economic decline, and the potential consequences of inaction.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward. Let me draft the summary, making sure each sentence adds value and contributes to the overall message without unnecessary details.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it captures the essence of the article, including the debate and the stakes involved, while maintaining the moral perspective that inaction could lead to negative economic outcomes.

SUMMARY: Senior White House officials have intensified pressure on congressional Democrats to pass the Bush tax cuts, warning that inaction could significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, the outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasized that failing to pass the bill in the next few weeks would "materially increase the risk" of economic stagnation. However, some experts, like Rob Shapiro, argue that the tax cut deal is not sufficient to prevent a downturn, as it does not address deeper economic issues, such as housing market stabilization. The administration is urging Democrats to accept the deal, warning of real consequences like tax increases and the loss of unemployment benefits if the bill fails. While some officials acknowledge the deal's limitations, they stress that delaying action could worsen the economic situation. The moral framing underscores the responsibility to act to prevent further economic harm, even if the solution is imperfect. END OF SUMMARY.
