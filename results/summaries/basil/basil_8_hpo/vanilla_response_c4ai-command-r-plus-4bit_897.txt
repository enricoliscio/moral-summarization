SUMMARY: White House officials warn congressional Democrats that failure to pass the Bush tax cuts deal could lead to a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, states that not passing the bill in the next few weeks could "materially increase the risk" of an economic downturn. The White House begins selling the deal to Democrats, emphasizing the potential economic consequences of inaction. David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs, senior advisers, argue that the deal includes significant benefits for the economy and that the alternative could result in higher taxes and decreased unemployment benefits. They suggest that further compromise could lead to decreased support and that the current deal is the best option available. The administration's pitch to Democrats emphasizes the potential economic fallout if the deal is not passed.
