SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats of the severe consequences of inaction on the Bush tax cuts, arguing that failing to pass the deal could "significantly increase the risk" of a double-dip recession. The message was clear: take the package now or risk facing the blame for an economic downturn. Larry Summers, the outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating that delaying the deal would "materially increase the risk" of the economy stalling and dipping into another recession. The White House began selling the deal to skeptical Democrats, urging them to consider the potential consequences of their decisions. David Axelrod, a senior adviser, asked lawmakers to consider the end game and the real consequences of inaction, including the increase in taxes and the loss of unemployment insurance for millions. The White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, questioned the logic of delaying the deal, stating that no one believed a compromise reached after a lengthy fight would be better than the current agreement. The White House's pitch emphasized the need for stability and action to help the economy and people, framing the decision as a moral choice with significant implications for the country's well-being. END OF SUMMARY.
