SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warn congressional Democrats that failing to pass a deal on the Bush tax cuts soon could have dire consequences for the economy, significantly increasing the risk of a double-dip recession. The message is clear: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn and its difficult aftermath. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasizes the stakes, stating that inaction will "materially increase the risk" of a recession. David Axelrod, senior adviser, asks skeptics to consider the endgame and the consequences of delaying action. Robert Gibbs, White House Press Secretary, echoes this sentiment, questioning the wisdom of those who would rather fight for a better deal, as the potential for a worse agreement looms. The White House's pitch to Democrats is a tough sell, as they grapple with the moral dilemma of extending tax cuts for the wealthy while trying to minimize the risk of economic downturn and stabilize the fragile economy.
