Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about senior White House officials trying to push congressional Democrats to pass a deal on the Bush tax cuts. They're warning that inaction could lead to a double dip recession. Larry Summers, the outgoing economic adviser, says not passing the bill soon would increase the risk of the economy stalling. He mentions that a double dip recession is a significant risk if they don't act quickly.

There's some debate about the effectiveness of the tax cuts. Summers downplayed the significance earlier, but that was before including unemployment insurance and other incentives. Another expert, Rob Shapiro, thinks waiting a month or two won't cause a double dip but the deal isn't enough to boost the economy significantly. He emphasizes stabilizing housing prices as crucial, but that's not part of the current plan.

The White House is trying to convince Democrats to support the deal, even though they're skeptical about extending tax cuts for the wealthy and revising estate taxes. They're using both threats (sticks) and limited incentives (carrots). Press Secretary Gibbs mentions that any changes to the deal would need to maintain support, but it's unclear how much effort that would take. The administration is saying take the deal now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn. They point out that without the deal, taxes will go up and unemployment benefits will end, which are real consequences. They argue that the deal has benefits despite its flaws.

So, the summary should capture the main points: the warning about the recession, the debate over the tax cut deal's effectiveness, the focus on housing, the White House's push to get Democrats on board, and the consequences of inaction. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise. Let me structure it step by step, highlighting each key point without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Senior White House officials are urging congressional Democrats to pass a Bush tax cut deal, warning that inaction could increase the risk of a double dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing economic adviser, emphasized that failing to pass the bill soon would significantly raise the risk of economic stagnation. However, some experts argue that the deal isn't sufficient to boost growth and that stabilizing housing prices is more critical. The White House is pushing for quick approval, highlighting the consequences of inaction, such as tax increases and loss of unemployment benefits. They argue the deal, despite its flaws, offers some benefits and urge Democrats to act to avoid blame for an economic downturn. END OF SUMMARY.
