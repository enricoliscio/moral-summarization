SUMMARY:

Senior White House officials have raised the stakes in the congressional debate over the Bush tax cuts, warning that inaction would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers stated that if Democrats don't pass the bill within the next couple of weeks, it would "materially increase the risk" of the economy stalling out. The White House is selling the deal to Democrats, who are skeptical about extending tax cuts for the wealthy and revising the estate tax. The administration's pitch is to take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn. If the deal fails, forecasts will go down, people's taxes will go up, and 2 million people will lose their unemployment insurance. The White House argues that the deal will help people and the economy, and that inaction will have real consequences. They urge Democrats to pass the bill, rather than risking a worse agreement down the line.
