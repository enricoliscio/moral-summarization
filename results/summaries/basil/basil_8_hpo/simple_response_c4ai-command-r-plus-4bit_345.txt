SUMMARY: Senior White House officials are warning congressional Democrats that failing to pass the Bush tax cuts could lead to a double-dip recession. The message is a stark one: accept the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, stated that inaction would "significantly increase the risk" of an economic stall. While the White House is pushing for the deal, some experts argue that the single most important thing to avert a recession is to stabilize housing prices, which is not currently on the congressional agenda. The White House is facing skepticism from Democrats who oppose the extension of tax cuts for the wealthy and a generous revision of the estate tax. The administration's pitch to the party seems to be a choice between accepting the current deal or risking economic consequences. David Axelrod, senior adviser, asks skeptics to consider the endgame and potential fallout of delaying or altering the package. The White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, also cautioned that any changes to the deal should not result in decreased support, highlighting the difficult position Democrats are in. END OF SUMMARY.
