SUMMARY:

Senior White House officials have warned congressional Democrats that failing to pass a deal on the Bush tax cuts would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers stated that if the bill is not passed in the next couple of weeks, it would materially increase the risk of the economy stalling out and entering a double dip recession. However, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official, disagreed, saying that a wait of a month or two would not cause a double dip recession. The White House has begun selling the deal to skeptical Democrats, warning that inaction would lead to economic downturn and blaming them if it fails. The administration is offering a take-it-or-leave-it approach, with few concessions, and warning of dire consequences if the deal is not passed.

END OF SUMMARY.
