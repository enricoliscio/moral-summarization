Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a provided news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. They've specified that I should use the morally framed words from the article, which are: inaction, pass, help, on, selling, up, lose. 

First, I need to understand the article. It's about senior White House officials pressuring congressional Democrats to pass a tax cut deal to avoid a double dip recession. They warn that inaction would increase the risk of a recession. Larry Summers is mentioned, stating that not passing the bill would significantly increase the risk. There's a debate about whether a delay would cause a double dip or not. The deal includes extensions for unemployment insurance and tax incentives, but some argue it's not enough. The White House is trying to sell the deal to Democrats, emphasizing the consequences of inaction, like increased taxes and loss of unemployment benefits. They argue that the deal, though not perfect, is better than nothing and that delaying would lead to worse outcomes.

Now, I need to summarize this while keeping the moral framing. I should use the specified words as much as possible. I'll start by noting that senior officials warned about the risks of inaction. Then, mention Summers' dire assessment. Include the debate about the delay causing a double dip. Highlight the deal's provisions and the criticism that it's insufficient. Note the White House's efforts to sell the deal, emphasizing the consequences of not passing it. Conclude with the administration's argument that the deal is better than the alternative.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, around 200 words, and includes the moral words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered without losing the moral framing. I'll check each sentence to see if I can incorporate the words like 'inaction,' 'pass,' 'help,' etc. 

For example, when talking about the consequences, I can say "failure to pass the bill would lead to higher taxes and loss of unemployment benefits." That uses 'pass' and 'lose.' When discussing the White House's efforts, I can say "they are selling the deal," using'selling.' 

I should also maintain the flow, ensuring it's clear and logical. After drafting, I'll review to ensure all key points are included and the moral words are appropriately used without forcing them in unnaturally.

SUMMARY: Senior White House officials have warned congressional Democrats that inaction on the Bush tax cut deal could "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession. Larry Summers, the outgoing economic adviser, emphasized that failure to pass the bill in the next few weeks would "materially increase the risk" of economic stagnation. While Summers previously downplayed the importance of extending the tax cuts for the wealthy, the current deal includes provisions to help lower-income workers, such as a 13-month extension of unemployment insurance. Critics argue that delaying the deal for a month or two would not cause a double dip but could lead to slower growth once the stimulus ends. The White House is actively selling the deal to skeptical Democrats, highlighting the consequences of inaction, including higher taxes and the loss of unemployment benefits for 2 million people. Senior adviser David Axelrod stressed that without the deal, the economy would face a "really difficult situation," urging Democrats to act now to avoid being blamed for an economic downturn. END OF SUMMARY.
