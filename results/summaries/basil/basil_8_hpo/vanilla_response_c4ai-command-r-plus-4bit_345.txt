SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats that failing to pass the Bush tax cuts deal promptly could lead to a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasized the potential consequences, claiming that inaction would "significantly increase the risk" of an economic downturn. The White House began aggressively selling the deal to Democrats, who were skeptical about extending tax cuts for the wealthy and revising the estate tax. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and senior adviser David Axelrod reinforced the urgency, suggesting that delaying the deal would have detrimental economic effects. They argued that the consequences of inaction were far worse than the provisions Democrats disliked. The administration's pitch emphasized the need to act now to avoid an even worse economic situation, and questioned the likelihood of a better agreement if Democrats chose to fight for changes.
