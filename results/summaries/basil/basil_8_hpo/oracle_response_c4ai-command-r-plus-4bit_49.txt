SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats that inaction on the Bush tax cuts deal could "significantly increase the risk" of a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasized the urgency of passing the deal, stating that a delay would "materially increase the risk" of an economic downturn. The administration's pitch to the party emphasized the potential consequences of inaction, suggesting that Democrats could be blamed for an economic downturn if they fail to pass the package now. David Axelrod, senior adviser, highlighted the "real consequences" of inaction, including tax increases and the loss of unemployment insurance for millions of people. The White House faced challenges in selling the deal to skeptical Democrats due to their opposition to extending tax cuts for the wealthy and revising the estate tax. However, the administration argued that the potential benefits to the economy and individuals outweighed these concerns. Robert Gibbs, White House Press Secretary, suggested that any changes to the deal that increased support would be fine, but cautioned against a lengthy and potentially futile fight over revisions. The message from the administration was clear: pass the package now to help the economy and individuals, or risk the consequences of inaction and a potential economic downturn.
