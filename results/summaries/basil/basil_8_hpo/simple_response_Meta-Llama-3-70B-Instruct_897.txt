SUMMARY:

The White House has issued a stern warning to congressional Democrats, stating that failing to pass a deal on the Bush tax cuts would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers emphasized the urgency of the situation, claiming that inaction would lead to a stalled economy. However, not all experts agree with this assessment, with Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official, suggesting that the wait would not cause a double dip recession. The White House is pushing Democrats to accept the current deal, which includes an extension of Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and a generous revision of the estate tax, warning that inaction would lead to economic downturn and blaming Democrats for the consequences. The administration is emphasizing the benefits of the deal, including a 13-month extension of unemployment insurance and other tax incentives to help lower-income workers.
