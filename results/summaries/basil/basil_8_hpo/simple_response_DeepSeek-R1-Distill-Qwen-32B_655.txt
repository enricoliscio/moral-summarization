Alright, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points and the underlying moral perspective.

The article talks about senior White House officials pressuring congressional Democrats to pass the Bush tax cuts, warning that inaction could lead to a double dip recession. Larry Summers is mentioned as saying that not passing the bill would increase the risk of the economy stalling. There's also a debate about the effectiveness of the tax cuts, with some arguing they're not enough to prevent a downturn and that stabilizing the housing market is more crucial. The White House is trying to convince Democrats to accept the deal, emphasizing the consequences of delay.

Now, the moral framing here seems to be about responsibility and the consequences of inaction. The White House is framing the situation as a critical moment where failure to act would have severe negative effects, particularly on unemployment and tax increases. They're using the fear of economic downturn to push for the tax cuts, even though some Democrats are skeptical about extending tax cuts for the wealthy.

I need to capture this moral angle in the summary. It's not just about the political maneuvering but the ethical responsibility to act to prevent harm. The officials are emphasizing the potential negative outcomes to persuade the Democrats, highlighting the moral duty to prevent economic harm.

I should also mention the counterarguments, like the belief that the tax cuts aren't sufficient and that housing stabilization is more important, but the White House is focused on immediate action. This shows a conflict between different moral priorities: one side prioritizing immediate economic measures, the other looking for more comprehensive solutions.

So, the summary should reflect this tension, showing the White House's emphasis on the risks of inaction and the counterarguments about the adequacy of the measures. It's important to convey that the moral framing is about the responsibility to act to prevent negative outcomes versus the need for more effective solutions.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the essence of the moral arguments presented. I'll structure it to first state the White House's warning, then mention the counterarguments, and conclude with the administration's push for immediate action despite skepticism.

Let me draft that, keeping it within the word limit and ensuring the moral elements are clear.

SUMMARY: Senior White House officials are intensifying pressure on congressional Democrats to pass the Bush tax cuts, warning that inaction could significantly increase the risk of a double dip recession. Larry Summers emphasized that failing to pass the bill would materially increase the risk of economic stagnation, while others, like Rob Shapiro, argued that the delay itself wouldn't cause a double dip but that the deal's stimulative effects are limited. The administration is framing the debate as a critical moment, with real consequences like tax increases and loss of unemployment benefits if the deal fails. They argue that any delay would result in a worse economic situation, urging Democrats to accept the package despite reservations about extending tax cuts for the wealthy. The moral framing centers on the responsibility to act to prevent economic harm, with the administration highlighting the potential negative outcomes of inaction. END OF SUMMARY.
