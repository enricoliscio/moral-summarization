SUMMARY:

Senior White House officials warned that inaction on the Bush tax cuts would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession, which would "materially increase the risk" that the economy would stall out. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers stated that if Democrats don't pass the bill in the next couple of weeks, it would increase the risk of a double dip recession. However, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official, offered a more sober-minded analysis, saying that waiting a month or two would not cause a double dip, but rather a contractionary fiscal policy would. Shapiro emphasized that stabilizing housing prices is crucial to avert slow growth. The White House is selling the deal to Democrats, warning that if the deal fails, people's taxes will go up, and 2 million people will lose their unemployment insurance, facing a really difficult situation. The administration's pitch is to take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn.
