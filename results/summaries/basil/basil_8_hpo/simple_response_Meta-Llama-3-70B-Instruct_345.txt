SUMMARY:

The White House has warned congressional Democrats that failing to pass a deal on the Bush tax cuts would significantly increase the risk of a double dip recession. Senior economic adviser Larry Summers stated that inaction would "materially increase the risk" of the economy stalling out and entering a double dip recession. However, Rob Shapiro, a former Clinton official, disagreed, saying that a double dip would come from a contractionary fiscal policy, not from waiting a month or two to pass a tax cut package. The White House is pushing Democrats to accept the deal, warning that inaction would lead to economic downturn and blaming them for the consequences. The administration is emphasizing the benefits of the deal, including the extension of unemployment insurance and tax incentives for lower-income workers, while downplaying the drawbacks, such as the extension of Bush tax cuts for the wealthy.
