Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Bush tax cuts and the efforts by the White House to get a deal passed. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, and it should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key elements seem to be:

1. Senior White House officials are pressuring congressional Democrats to pass the Bush tax cuts.
2. They warn that inaction could lead to a double dip recession.
3. Larry Summers is mentioned, stating that not passing the bill would increase the risk of the economy stalling.
4. There's debate about whether the tax cuts are enough to prevent a downturn.
5. Rob Shapiro counters that a delay wouldn't cause a double dip but the deal isn't enough to lift the economy.
6. The White House is pushing the deal, emphasizing the consequences of not passing it, like tax increases and loss of unemployment benefits.
7. They're trying to convince Democrats by highlighting the risks of inaction.

I need to condense this into a summary that captures the urgency, the arguments for and against the tax cuts, and the White House's strategy. I should mention the key players like Summers and Shapiro, the risks they mention, and the consequences of inaction. Also, note that the deal includes extensions for unemployment and tax incentives for lower-income workers, which might not have been included earlier.

I should structure the summary to first state the main action (White House pressuring Democrats), then the warnings, the counterarguments, and the consequences. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

Let me draft a few sentences:

"Senior White House officials are urging congressional Democrats to pass the Bush tax cuts, warning that inaction could increase the risk of a double dip recession. Larry Summers emphasized the urgency, stating that failing to pass the bill would materially increase the risk of economic stagnation. However, Rob Shapiro argued that a delay wouldn't cause a double dip but noted the deal isn't sufficient to boost the economy significantly. The White House is highlighting the consequences of inaction, such as tax increases and loss of unemployment benefits, to push for the deal, which includes extensions for lower-income workers. Despite counterarguments, the administration is focused on the risks of delay and the potential economic impact."

Now, check the word count. That's about 100 words, so I can add more details if needed. Maybe include that the deal was revised to include unemployment and tax incentives, which Summers didn't support earlier. Also, mention the push to get the deal passed quickly to avoid blame for an economic downturn.

Finalizing the summary to include all key points concisely.

SUMMARY: Senior White House officials are intensifying efforts to push congressional Democrats to approve the Bush tax cuts, warning that inaction could significantly raise the risk of a double dip recession. Larry Summers emphasized that failing to pass the bill in the next few weeks would materially increase the risk of economic stagnation. However, Rob Shapiro argued that a delay wouldn't cause a double dip but noted the deal isn't sufficient to boost the economy significantly. The White House is highlighting the consequences of inaction, such as tax increases and loss of unemployment benefits, to push for the deal, which includes extensions for lower-income workers. Despite counterarguments, the administration is focused on the risks of delay and the potential economic impact. END OF SUMMARY.
