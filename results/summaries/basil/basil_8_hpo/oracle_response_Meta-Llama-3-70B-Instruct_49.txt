SUMMARY:

Senior White House officials are warning congressional Democrats that inaction on the Bush tax cuts will "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers stated that if the bill is not passed in the next couple of weeks, it will "materially increase the risk" of the economy stalling out. The message is clear: pass the bill or face the consequences. The White House is selling the deal to Democrats, who are skeptical about extending tax cuts for the wealthy and revising the estate tax. The administration's pitch is: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn. Inaction will lead to people's taxes going up and 2 million people losing their unemployment insurance. The White House is emphasizing that the deal will help people and the economy, and that without it, the situation will be really difficult. The moral imperative is clear: act now to help the economy and those in need, or face the consequences of inaction.
