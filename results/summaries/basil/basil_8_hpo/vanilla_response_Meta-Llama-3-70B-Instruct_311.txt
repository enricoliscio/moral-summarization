SUMMARY:

Senior White House officials, including outgoing economic adviser Larry Summers, are warning congressional Democrats that if they don't pass a deal on the Bush tax cuts within the next couple of weeks, it could significantly increase the risk of a double dip recession. Summers stated that inaction would "materially increase the risk" of the economy stalling out. However, Rob Shapiro, a former Clinton White House official, disagreed, saying that waiting a month or two to pass a tax cut package would not cause a double dip recession. The White House is pushing Democrats to pass the deal, which includes an extension of unemployment insurance and other tax incentives, warning that failure to do so could lead to an economic downturn. The administration is emphasizing the potential consequences of inaction, including increased taxes and lost unemployment insurance for millions of people.

END OF SUMMARY.
