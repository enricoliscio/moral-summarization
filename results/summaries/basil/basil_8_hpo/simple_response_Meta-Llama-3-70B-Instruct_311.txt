SUMMARY:

Senior White House officials, including Larry Summers, have warned congressional Democrats that failing to pass a deal on the Bush tax cuts would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession. Summers stated that if the bill is not passed in the next couple of weeks, it would materially increase the risk of the economy stalling out and entering a double dip recession. However, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official, offered a more sober-minded analysis, saying that a wait of a month or two would not cause a double dip, but rather a contractionary fiscal policy. The White House has begun a robust process of selling the deal to Democrats, warning that inaction would lead to economic downturn and blaming them for the consequences. The administration's pitch is to take the package now or risk being blamed for the economic downturn, highlighting the real consequences of inaction, including increased taxes and loss of unemployment insurance.
