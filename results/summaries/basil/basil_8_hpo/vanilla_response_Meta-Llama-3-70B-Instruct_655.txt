SUMMARY:

Senior White House officials, including outgoing economic adviser Larry Summers, are warning congressional Democrats that failing to pass a deal on the Bush tax cuts could lead to a double dip recession. Summers stated that inaction would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession. However, other experts, such as Rob Shapiro, disagree, saying that a delay in passing the tax cut package would not cause a double dip recession. The White House is pushing Democrats to accept the current deal, which includes an extension of Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and a generous revision of the estate tax, or risk being blamed for an economic downturn. The administration is emphasizing the potential consequences of inaction, including increased taxes and the loss of unemployment insurance for 2 million people.

END OF SUMMARY.
