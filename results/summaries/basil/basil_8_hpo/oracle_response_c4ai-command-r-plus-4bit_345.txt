SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats that inaction on the Bush tax cuts deal could "significantly increase the risk" of a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasized the urgency of passing the deal, stating that a delay would "materially increase the risk" of an economic downturn. The White House began aggressively selling the deal to skeptical Democrats, who oppose the extension of tax cuts for the wealthy and revisions to the estate tax. The administration's pitch highlighted the potential consequences of inaction, urging Democrats to take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn. David Axelrod, senior adviser, questioned the endgame of those who wanted to fight for more, emphasizing the real consequences of inaction, including tax increases and the loss of unemployment insurance for millions. Robert Gibbs, White House Press Secretary, also emphasized the urgency of passing the deal, asking who would benefit from an eight-week fight that could lead to a worse agreement. The moral framing of the article centers around the potential consequences of inaction, with the White House urging Democrats to pass the deal and help the economy, rather than risking an economic downturn and losing the benefits of the package. END OF SUMMARY.
