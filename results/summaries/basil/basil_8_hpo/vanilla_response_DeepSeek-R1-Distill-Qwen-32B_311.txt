Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about senior White House officials trying to get Congress to pass the Bush tax cuts. They're warning that not passing the bill could lead to a double dip recession. Larry Summers, the outgoing economic adviser, says if the bill doesn't pass in the next few weeks, the risk of the economy stalling increases. He mentions a double dip recession, but downplays the significance of continuing the tax cuts back in September, though at that time the deal didn't include unemployment insurance extensions or other incentives for lower-income workers.

Then there's Rob Shapiro, a former Clinton commerce official, who says waiting a month or two won't cause a double dip, but the fiscal policy might be contractionary. He thinks the current deal is stimulative but not enough to lift the economy. He emphasizes stabilizing housing prices as crucial, but that's not on the congressional agenda.

The White House is pushing the deal to Democrats, who are skeptical about extending tax cuts for the wealthy and revising the estate tax. They're offering few incentives, and Gibbs says any changes should not decrease support. The administration is telling Democrats to take the package now or be blamed for an economic downturn. Axelrod mentions that without the deal, people's taxes will go up and unemployment insurance will end, leading to real consequences. Gibbs questions if waiting would result in a better agreement.

So, the key points are: White House warns inaction on tax cuts risks a double dip recession. Summers highlights the risk, Shapiro says the deal is stimulative but not enough. Stabilizing housing is key but not in the plan. The administration is pressuring Democrats to pass the bill, emphasizing the consequences of delay. The summary should capture all this concisely, under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Senior White House officials have warned that failing to pass the Bush tax cuts could increase the risk of a double dip recession, with outgoing economic adviser Larry Summers emphasizing the urgency. While Summers previously downplayed the tax cuts for the wealthy, the current deal includes extensions for unemployment insurance and tax incentives for lower-income workers. Rob Shapiro, a former Clinton official, argued that waiting a month or two wouldn't cause a double dip but criticized the deal as insufficient to boost the economy significantly, stressing the need to stabilize housing prices. The White House is urging Democrats to pass the bill, highlighting the consequences of delay, such as tax increases and loss of unemployment insurance. Administration officials argue that any delay would likely result in a less favorable agreement. END OF SUMMARY.
