SUMMARY:
Senior White House officials warned that inaction on the Bush tax cuts would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession, a "dire" consequence. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers stated that if Democrats don't pass the bill in the next couple of weeks, it would "materially increase the risk" of economic stagnation. However, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official, offered a more "sober-minded" analysis, saying that the wait wouldn't cause a double dip, but rather a "contractionary fiscal policy" would. The White House is pushing for a deal, warning Democrats that rejecting it would lead to "real consequences," including increased taxes and lost unemployment insurance for 2 million people. The administration's message is clear: take the package now or risk being "blamed" for an economic downturn. END OF SUMMARY.
