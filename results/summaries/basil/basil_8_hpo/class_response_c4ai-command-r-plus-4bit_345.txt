SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats of the severe consequences of failing to pass the deal on Bush tax cuts, arguing that inaction could lead to a significant increase in the risk of a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasized the urgency of the matter, stating that not passing the bill in the next few weeks would materially increase the risk of the economy stalling out and entering a downward spiral. The message was clear: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn. David Axelrod, senior adviser, highlighted the real consequences of inaction, including the certainty of tax increases and the loss of unemployment insurance for millions of people. The White House faced the challenging task of selling the deal to skeptical Democrats, who were reluctant to extend tax cuts for the wealthy and revise the estate tax. The administration's pitch emphasized the potential benefits of the package for the economy and the American people, urging Democrats to consider the end game and the potential fallout of delaying the decision. The White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, questioned the logic of those advocating for an eight-week fight, suggesting that such a delay would not result in a better agreement than the one currently on the table. The message was a stark choice: accept the deal now or face the consequences of a struggling economy.
