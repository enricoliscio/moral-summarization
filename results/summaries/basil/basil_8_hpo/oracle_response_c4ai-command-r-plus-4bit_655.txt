SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats that inaction on the Bush tax cuts deal could "significantly increase the risk" of a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasized the urgency of passing the deal, stating that a delay would "materially increase the risk" of an economic downturn. The White House began a robust effort to sell the deal to skeptical Democrats, arguing that the package included significant help for people and the economy. David Axelrod, senior adviser, questioned the endgame of those who wanted to fight for more, highlighting the real consequences of inaction, including an increase in taxes and the loss of unemployment insurance for millions. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs echoed this sentiment, asking who on earth believed that a prolonged fight would result in a better agreement. The message was clear: take the package now or risk an economic downturn and the blame that comes with it.
END OF SUMMARY.
