SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats that failing to pass the Bush tax cuts deal could "significantly increase the risk" of a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating that inaction would "materially increase the risk" of an economic downturn. The message was clear: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic stall. David Axelrod, senior adviser, questioned the end game of those who oppose the deal, highlighting the real consequences of inaction, including tax increases and the loss of unemployment insurance for millions. The White House began a robust process of selling the deal to skeptical Democrats, emphasizing the potential economic fallout if the agreement fails and facing a difficult situation. The pitch was stark: accept the package or risk economic turmoil.
