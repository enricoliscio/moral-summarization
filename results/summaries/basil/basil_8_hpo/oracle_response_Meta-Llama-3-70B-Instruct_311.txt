SUMMARY:

Senior White House officials are warning congressional Democrats that inaction on the Bush tax cuts will "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers stated that if Democrats don't pass the bill in the next couple of weeks, it will "materially increase the risk" of the economy stalling out. This dire assessment is meant to urge Democrats to take action and pass the bill, which includes a 13-month extension of unemployment insurance and other tax incentives to help lower-income workers. However, some experts argue that the wait would not cause a double dip, and that the deal is not enough to lift the economy to a different place. The White House is selling the deal to Democrats, warning that if they don't pass it, they will be blamed for an economic downturn. The administration is urging Democrats to take the package now, or risk facing real consequences, including people losing their unemployment insurance and taxes going up.
