SUMMARY: Senior White House officials warned congressional Democrats that failing to pass the Bush tax cuts deal would "significantly increase the risk" of a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, the outgoing senior economic adviser, emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating that inaction would "materially increase the risk" of an economic downturn. The White House began a robust campaign to sell the deal to skeptical Democrats, arguing that the benefits of the deal outweighed the unpopular provisions. David Axelrod, a senior adviser, pointed out the real consequences of inaction, including an increase in taxes and the loss of unemployment insurance for millions. The message was clear: take the deal now or risk an economic downturn and the blame that comes with it. Robert Gibbs, the White House Press Secretary, questioned the logic of delaying the deal, asking who would benefit from an eight-week fight that would likely result in a worse agreement. The White House's moral framing centered on the greater good of economic stability and the potential harm caused by delaying the deal, urging Democrats to set aside their skepticism for the benefit of the country.
