Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The article is about Senior White House officials pressuring congressional Democrats to pass the Bush tax cuts, warning that inaction could lead to a double dip recession. The author used specific morally framed words like inaction, pass, help, on, selling, up, and lose. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Senior officials are raising the stakes, warning inaction increases recession risk. Larry Summers is mentioned as saying that not passing the bill would increase the risk of the economy stalling. There's debate about whether a month or two delay would cause a double dip. Shapiro argues that it's not the delay but contractionary fiscal policy. The White House is trying to sell the deal to Democrats, who are skeptical about extending tax cuts for the wealthy. There are no major concessions, just the threat of blame for economic downturns. Axelrod mentions real consequences like tax increases and losing unemployment benefits. Gibbs questions if a later compromise would be better.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary, using the morally framed words. I'll start by stating that Senior White House officials are pressuring Democrats, using "inaction" as a threat. Mention the dire warnings from Summers about not passing the bill. Highlight the debate over the impact of delay versus fiscal policy. Note the efforts to "sell" the deal despite skepticism. Include the consequences of inaction, like losing unemployment and tax increases. End with the administration's argument that any delay would lead to a worse outcome.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes all the specified moral words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered concisely.

SUMMARY: Senior White House officials are pressuring congressional Democrats to "pass" the Bush tax cuts, warning that "inaction" could "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession. Larry Summers emphasized that failing to act would "materially increase the risk" of economic stagnation. While some, like Rob Shapiro, argue that the delay itself wouldn't cause a double dip, others stress the importance of the deal to "help" the economy. The administration is "selling" the package to Democrats, who are skeptical about extending tax cuts for the wealthy. Without the deal, millions could "lose" unemployment benefits, and taxes would rise. Officials warn that any delay would "up" the stakes, potentially leading to a worse economic outcome. END OF SUMMARY.
