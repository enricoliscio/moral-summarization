SUMMARY:

The White House is warning Democrats that failing to pass a deal on the Bush tax cuts will significantly increase the risk of a double dip recession. Outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers stated that if the bill isn't passed in the next couple of weeks, it will materially increase the risk of the economy stalling out. However, not everyone agrees with this dire assessment, with Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official, saying that waiting a month or two to pass the tax cut package would not cause a double dip recession. The White House is trying to sell the deal to skeptical Democrats, warning that inaction will lead to economic downturn and blaming them for it. The administration is emphasizing the consequences of not passing the deal, including increased taxes and loss of unemployment insurance for 2 million people.

END OF SUMMARY.
