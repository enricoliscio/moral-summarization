SUMMARY: National Security Adviser Susan Rice warns that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress is "destructive" to US-Israel relations. The invitation, extended by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, has added political tension to an already strained relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. Netanyahu's visit is seen as an attempt to derail nuclear negotiations with Iran, a key Obama foreign policy objective. U.S. officials report progress in the negotiations, while Israeli officials warn that a potential deal could make Iran a nuclear threshold state. Vice President Biden and several Democratic lawmakers plan to boycott Netanyahu's speech, citing concerns about partisanship and respect for the Obama administration. Netanyahu also declines an invitation to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats, further fueling tensions. Senator Lindsey Graham criticizes Biden's absence as "appalling and unacceptable." Senator Dick Durbin expresses disappointment in Netanyahu's refusal to meet, stating that it was an opportunity to balance the partisan nature of the invitation.
