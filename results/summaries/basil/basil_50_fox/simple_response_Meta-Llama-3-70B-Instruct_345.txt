SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice has warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress will be a "destructive" force in US-Israel relations, adding to the already contentious visit. Rice's comments are among the Obama administration's toughest on the issue, highlighting the bipartisan nature of the relationship that needs to be maintained. The visit has been criticized for being politically motivated, with Netanyahu invited by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department. The move has further strained the relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu, with tensions rising on all sides. Netanyahu has turned down an invitation to meet with leading Senate Democrats, citing concerns about partisanship. The visit is seen as an attempt to derail a nuclear deal with Iran, a key Obama foreign policy objective. The controversy has led to several Democrats announcing they will skip the event, while Republicans have criticized the administration's response.
