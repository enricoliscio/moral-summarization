Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Susan Rice warning that Netanyahu's speech will harm U.S.-Israel relations. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, Susan Rice is the National Security Adviser, and she's saying Netanyahu's upcoming address on Capitol Hill is destructive. The visit was invited by House Speaker Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department, which is a diplomatic no-no. Boehner wanted Netanyahu to talk about Iran's nuclear threat during negotiations.

The article mentions that this visit is causing strain between Obama and Netanyahu. Rice emphasizes the importance of maintaining bipartisan support for the U.S.-Israel relationship. The administration was previously more low-key, but now tensions are rising.

Netanyahu declined a meeting with Senate Democrats, saying it might seem partisan. He assured them his intention was to voice concerns about the Iran deal. U.S. officials think the visit is to derail the nuclear deal, which is a key Obama policy. Netanyahu is against the deal, fearing it leaves Iran too close to a nuclear weapon.

The negotiations are making progress, but Israel warns it could make Iran a nuclear threshold state. Biden and several Democrats won't attend the speech, while Republicans like Lindsey Graham criticize Biden's absence as disrespectful.

Durbin regrets Netanyahu didn't meet with Democrats, thinking it could balance Boehner's invitation.

So, the main points are:
- Rice warns Netanyahu's speech will harm relations.
- Boehner invited him without consulting the White House.
- Netanyahu's visit is seen as partisan and aimed at derailing the Iran deal.
- Netanyahu refused to meet Democrats, leading to criticism.
- The speech is causing political divisions and affecting Obama's foreign policy.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include key players and the main issues.
