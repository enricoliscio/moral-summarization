SUMMARY: U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress could damage long-standing U.S.-Israel relations. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, without consulting the White House, a move seen as a diplomatic breach. Boehner defended his invitation, citing concerns about the threat of a nuclear Iran. Rice's comments reflect the Obama administration's increasing frustration with Netanyahu's visit, which has further strained relations between the two leaders. Netanyahu rejected an invitation to meet privately with Senate Democrats, citing concerns about partisanship, while several House and Senate Democrats plan to boycott Netanyahu's speech, calling it an affront to the Obama administration's Iran negotiations. Vice President Biden also won't attend the speech, drawing criticism from Republicans. The controversy surrounding Netanyahu's visit underscores the tensions between the U.S. and Israel over Iran's nuclear program and the ongoing negotiations.
END OF SUMMARY.
