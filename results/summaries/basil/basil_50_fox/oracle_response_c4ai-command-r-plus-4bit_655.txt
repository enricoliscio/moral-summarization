SUMMARY: National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress will be "destructive" to the fabric of US-Israel relations. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John Boehner without conferring with the White House or State Department, a move considered diplomatically inappropriate. Boehner defended his invitation by citing the need to address the threat of Iran's nuclear program. Rice's comments add to the already strained relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. Netanyahu's visit is seen as a partisan move to derail a nuclear deal with Iran, a key Obama foreign policy objective. U.S. officials have made progress in negotiations with Iran on restricting its nuclear activities, while Israeli officials warn that Iran could become a nuclear threshold state. Vice President Biden and several Democratic lawmakers plan to boycott Netanyahu's speech, viewing it as an affront to the Obama administration's negotiations with Iran. Netanyahu also rejected an invitation to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats, further fueling partisan tensions. Senator Lindsey Graham criticized Biden's absence as "appalling and unacceptable," while Senator Dick Durbin expressed disappointment in Netanyahu's refusal to meet.
END OF SUMMARY.
