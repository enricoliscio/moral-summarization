SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill address will be a "destructive" force in long-standing U.S.-Israel relations, adding more political acrimony to the already "strained" relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. The visit, orchestrated by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department, has been deemed a "diplomatic no-no" and an "affront" to Obama. Netanyahu's refusal to meet with leading Senate Democrats has been met with "disappointment" and "regret". Rice's comments were among the Obama administration's "toughest" on Netanyahu's speech, set for March 3. The visit has sparked a partisan divide, with Vice President Biden and over a half-dozen House and Senate Democrats skipping the event, while Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham called Biden's absence "appalling and unacceptable". The controversy surrounds Netanyahu's opposition to a potential nuclear deal with Iran, which he believes would leave Iran on the brink of being able to build a nuclear weapon. END OF SUMMARY.
