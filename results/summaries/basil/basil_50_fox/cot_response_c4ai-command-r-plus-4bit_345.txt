SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress will be *destructive* to US-Israel relations. House Speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu without consulting the White House, a diplomatic *no-no*. Netanyahu *regrets* that his visit has been perceived as political, saying his *sole intention* was to voice Israel's *grave concerns* about a potential nuclear deal with Iran. Rice's comments reflect the Obama administration's tough stance on Netanyahu's speech, which they see as an *assault* on the President and an attempt to derail a signature foreign policy objective. Vice President Biden and several Democrats plan to boycott the speech, calling it an act of *disrespect*. Despite these concerns, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham defended Netanyahu's visit, and some Democrats *expressed disappointment* that Netanyahu refused to meet with them privately during his trip.
END OF SUMMARY.
