SUMMARY: National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress could damage the long-standing bipartisan U.S.-Israel relationship. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, a breach of diplomatic protocol, to address concerns about Iran's nuclear threat. Rice's comments add to the growing tensions between President Obama and Netanyahu, who has also declined an invitation to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats during his trip. U.S. officials believe Netanyahu's trip aims to derail Obama's nuclear negotiations with Iran, with Netanyahu fearing concessions that could leave Iran close to obtaining nuclear weapons. Vice President Biden and several Democrats have announced they will boycott Netanyahu's speech, while some Republicans view their absence as a sign of disrespect to Israel. This controversy highlights the challenges in the relationship between the two leaders and the partisan divide in U.S. politics regarding Israel.
END OF SUMMARY.
