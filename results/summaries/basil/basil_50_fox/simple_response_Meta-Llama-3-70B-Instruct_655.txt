SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill address will be a "destructive" force in long-standing U.S.-Israel relations. The visit, orchestrated by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department, has further strained the relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. Rice emphasized the importance of maintaining a bipartisan approach to U.S.-Israel relations. Netanyahu's refusal to meet with leading Senate Democrats has been seen as a snub, with some Democrats boycotting the speech. The visit is widely seen as an attempt to derail a nuclear deal with Iran, a key Obama foreign policy objective. The controversy has exposed deep divisions within the U.S. political establishment, with Republicans accusing the Obama administration of prioritizing politics over national security concerns.
