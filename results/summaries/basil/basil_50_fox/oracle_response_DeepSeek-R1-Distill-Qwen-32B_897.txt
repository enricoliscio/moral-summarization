Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a summary of a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the article. It's about Susan Rice warning that Netanyahu's speech could harm US-Israel relations. The key points are the political tension, the diplomatic no-no of inviting Netanyahu without consulting the White House, the nuclear threat from Iran, and the divide between Republicans and Democrats.

I notice the user provided a list of morally framed words: conferring, threat, bipartisan, influence, partisan, threaten, derailing, build, clamp, ease, become, affront, unacceptable, listening, receiving, invitation, stood. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

The user wants the summary to be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I should structure it to highlight the conflict, the diplomatic issues, and the political implications. I'll need to weave in those moral words naturally without making it sound forced.

I'll start by introducing Susan Rice's warning about the destructive impact on US-Israel relations. Then mention the invitation without conferring, the nuclear threat, and the bipartisan concern. Next, touch on Netanyahu refusing to meet with Democrats to avoid partisanship, but his intent is to derail the nuclear deal. Include the Democrats skipping the event as an affront, and Republicans like Graham calling it unacceptable. Finally, note the ongoing tensions and Biden's absence.

I need to make sure each sentence includes as many of the moral words as possible without making the summary too clunky. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each point flows logically and the moral terms are preserved.

SUMMARY: National Security Adviser Susan Rice criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill address, warning it could be "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Netanyahu, invited by Republican Speaker John Boehner without conferring with the White House, aims to address the nuclear threat from Iran, a key concern for Israel. Rice emphasized the need to maintain bipartisan support for the U.S.-Israel relationship, stating that Netanyahu's visit could influence political dynamics negatively. Netanyahu rejected a private meeting with Senate Democrats, fearing it might compound the perception of partisanship. U.S. officials suspect his visit is aimed at derailing the nuclear deal with Iran, a top priority for President Obama. Netanyahu has expressed skepticism over the negotiations, arguing they could allow Iran to build a nuclear weapon. The visit has caused political divisions, with some Democrats calling it an affront to Obama, while Republicans like Lindsey Graham criticized Biden's absence as unacceptable. Netanyahu's refusal to meet with Democrats was seen as disappointing by long-standing allies. The visit has further strained the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu, highlighting the delicate balance between diplomacy and partisanship. END OF SUMMARY.
