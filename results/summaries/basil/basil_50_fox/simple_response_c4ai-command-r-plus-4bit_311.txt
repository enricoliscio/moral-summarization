SUMMARY: National Security Adviser Susan Rice asserts that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Capitol Hill will damage long-standing bipartisan U.S.-Israel relations. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department, a breach of diplomatic protocol. Boehner maintains that Netanyahu's visit is intended to address the nuclear threat posed by Iran. However, U.S. officials believe the trip aims to undermine ongoing negotiations with Iran, a key foreign policy objective for President Obama. Rice's comments reflect the administration's growing frustration with Netanyahu's visit, which has already sparked political tensions. Netanyahu rejected an invitation to meet with leading Senate Democrats, stating that he did not want to create a "misperception of partisanship." Vice President Biden and several Democratic lawmakers plan to boycott Netanyahu's speech, viewing it as an insult to the administration's efforts to negotiate with Iran. This incident highlights the complex dynamics of U.S.-Israel relations and the challenges faced by the Obama administration in navigating these tensions. END OF SUMMARY.
