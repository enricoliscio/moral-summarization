SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill address will be a "destructive" force in long-standing U.S.-Israel relations, adding more political acrimony to the already "strained" relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. The visit, orchestrated by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department, has sparked concerns about "partisanship" and has been deemed a "diplomatic no-no." Netanyahu's refusal to meet with leading Senate Democrats has been met with "disappointment" and "regret." Meanwhile, Vice President Biden and several Democrats have announced they will skip the event, calling it an "affront" to Obama and the administration. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, on the other hand, deemed Biden's absence "unacceptable" and "appalling." The controversy surrounding the visit has highlighted the "grave" concerns about a potential nuclear agreement with Iran. END OF SUMMARY.
