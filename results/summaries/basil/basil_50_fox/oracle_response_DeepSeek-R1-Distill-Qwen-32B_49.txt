Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points and identify where those words fit in.

The article is about Susan Rice warning that Netanyahu's speech will be destructive to U.S.-Israel relations. Netanyahu was invited by Boehner without consulting the White House, which is a diplomatic no-no. The visit is causing strain between Obama and Netanyahu, especially regarding the nuclear negotiations with Iran. Rice emphasized the need for a bipartisan approach. Netanyahu refused to meet with Senate Democrats, saying it might be seen as partisan. The visit is seen as an attempt to derail the nuclear deal, which is a key Obama policy. Some Democrats are boycotting the speech, while Republicans like Graham are criticizing Biden for not attending. Durbin regrets that Netanyahu didn't meet with Democrats.

Now, I need to include the morally framed words: conferring, threat, bipartisan, influence, partisan, threaten, derailing, build, clamp, ease, become, affront, unacceptable, listening, receiving, invitation, stood.

I should structure the summary to cover the main points: Rice's warning, Boehner's invitation without conferring, the impact on U.S.-Israel relations, Netanyahu's refusal to meet Democrats, the nuclear deal's threat, the partisanship, and the reactions from both sides.

I need to make sure to use as many of the listed words as possible without making it forced. Let me draft the summary, keeping it under 200 words and ending with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Capitol Hill speech would be a "destructive" force, threatening the bipartisan U.S.-Israel relationship. Netanyahu, invited by House Speaker John Boehner without conferring with the White House, aims to address Iran’s nuclear threat, but his visit risks derailing the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Tehran. Rice emphasized the need to maintain bipartisan support, while Netanyahu refused to meet with Senate Democrats, fearing it would compound partisan perceptions. U.S. officials suspect the visit is intended to influence the negotiations, with Netanyahu opposing Obama’s concessions. Over a dozen Democrats boycotted the speech, calling it an affront to the administration, while Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham criticized Vice President Biden’s absence as unacceptable. Durbin regretted Netanyahu’s refusal to meet, noting the invitation was an opportunity to balance Boehner’s politically divisive move. The visit highlights tensions over Iran’s nuclear program and the strained relationship between Obama and Netanyahu. END OF SUMMARY.
