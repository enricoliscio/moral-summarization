SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress will be "destructive" to US-Israel relations. The visit, arranged by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department, has sparked controversy and strained relations between President Obama and Netanyahu. Rice's comments are among the toughest from the Obama administration, emphasizing the need to keep US-Israel relations bipartisan. Netanyahu has declined an invitation to meet with Senate Democrats, citing concerns about perceived partisanship. US officials believe Netanyahu's trip aims to derail a nuclear deal with Iran, a key Obama foreign policy objective. Vice President Biden and several House and Senate Democrats will boycott the speech, while Republicans have criticized the administration's response.
