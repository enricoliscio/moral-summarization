Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Susan Rice warning that Netanyahu's Capitol Hill speech could harm U.S.-Israel relations. She calls it a "destructive" force. Netanyahu was invited by Boehner without consulting the White House, which is a diplomatic issue. Boehner wanted Netanyahu to discuss Iran's nuclear threat during negotiations with Tehran.

The visit is causing strain between Obama and Netanyahu. Rice's comments are some of the toughest from the administration, indicating the severity of the situation. Previously, they had a low-key stance, saying Obama wouldn't meet Netanyahu to avoid influencing Israel's elections. But now tensions are rising.

Netanyahu refused to meet Senate Democrats, saying it might be seen as partisan. He wrote a letter explaining his intentions were to voice concerns about Iran's nuclear deal. U.S. officials think his trip aims to derail the nuclear deal, which is a key Obama policy. Netanyahu is skeptical of the negotiations and thinks Obama is making concessions that could let Iran build a nuclear weapon.

Negotiations are making progress, but Israel warns it would allow Iran to become a nuclear threshold state. Biden won't attend Netanyahu's speech, and several Democrats are skipping it, calling it disrespectful. Republican Sen. Graham criticizes Biden's absence, saying it shows disrespect and more concern for Israeli politics than the threat from Iran. Durbin regrets Netanyahu's refusal to meet, noting the offer was to balance the partisan invitation.

So, the moral framing here is about the impact on U.S.-Israel relations, the partisanship involved, and the potential consequences for the nuclear negotiations. I need to capture these elements in the summary, keeping it under 200 words and preserving the moral perspective.

I'll start by mentioning Rice's warning, the diplomatic no-no of Boehner's invitation, and the strain on Obama-Netanyahu relations. Then, I'll note Rice's tough stance and the refusal to meet Democrats, Netanyahu's claims, and the U.S. officials' view on his intentions. Finally, I'll include the political fallout, like Biden and Democrats skipping the speech, and the criticism from Graham and Durbin.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all these points succinctly, highlighting the moral issues of partisanship and its impact on the relationship and negotiations.

SUMMARY: National Security Adviser Susan Rice has warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill speech could harm U.S.-Israel relations, calling it a "destructive" force. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, a move seen as a diplomatic misstep. Rice emphasized the need to maintain bipartisan support for the U.S.-Israel relationship, which has been strained under President Obama and Netanyahu. Netanyahu declined to meet with Senate Democrats, citing concerns about appearing partisan, but assured them his intent was to voice Israel's concerns over a potential nuclear deal with Iran. U.S. officials believe Netanyahu's visit aims to derail the nuclear negotiations, a key Obama administration priority. Netanyahu has criticized Obama's approach to the talks, arguing it could leave Iran close to building a nuclear weapon. The visit has also caused political fallout, with Vice President Biden and several Democrats skipping Netanyahu's speech, while Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham criticized Biden's absence as disrespectful. Netanyahu's refusal to meet with Democrats disappointed some long-standing supporters of Israel. END OF SUMMARY.
