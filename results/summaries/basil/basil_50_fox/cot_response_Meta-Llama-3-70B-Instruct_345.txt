SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill address will be a "destructive" force in long-standing U.S.-Israel relations, adding more political acrimony to the already "strained" relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. The visit, orchestrated by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department, has been deemed a "diplomatic no-no" and has sparked concerns of "partisanship" surrounding the event. Netanyahu's refusal to meet with leading Senate Democrats has been met with "disappointment" and "regrets" from lawmakers who have historically stood by Israel. Meanwhile, Vice President Biden and several Democrats have announced they will skip the event, calling it an "affront" to Obama and the administration as they negotiate with Iran over its nuclear program. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, on the other hand, deemed Biden's absence "appalling and unacceptable," showing "disrespect" to Israel. END OF SUMMARY.
