SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress will be a "destructive" force in US-Israel relations, adding to the already contentious visit. Rice's comments are among the Obama administration's toughest on Netanyahu's speech, which was invited by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department. The visit has further strained the relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu, with tensions rising on all sides. Netanyahu turned down an invitation to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats, citing concerns about perceptions of partisanship. US officials suggest Netanyahu's trip is aimed at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, a signature Obama foreign policy objective. Vice President Biden and several House and Senate Democrats will skip the event, calling it an affront to Obama and the administration.

END OF SUMMARY.
