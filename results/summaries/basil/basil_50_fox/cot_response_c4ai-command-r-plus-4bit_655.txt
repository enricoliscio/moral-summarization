SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress would be "destructive" to the long-standing bipartisan U.S.-Israel relationship. This warning adds to the moral acrimony and contention surrounding Netanyahu's visit, which was invited by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department, a diplomatically *disrespectful* move. The visit challenges the already strained relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu, with U.S. officials suggesting that Netanyahu aims to derail a nuclear deal with Iran, a key Obama foreign policy objective. Netanyahu has expressed *skepticism* about the negotiations and fears that Obama will make *concessions* that endanger Israel. Rice's comments reflect the administration's toughest stance yet on the visit, with some Democrats expressing disappointment and calling the event an affront to the President. Vice President Biden will not attend the speech, and some Democrats will boycott it, citing concerns about the *disrespect* shown to the administration. END OF SUMMARY.
