SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice has warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress will be a "destructive" force in U.S.-Israel relations, further straining the already tense relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. Rice's comments are among the Obama administration's toughest on the issue, emphasizing the need for bipartisanship in U.S.-Israel relations. Netanyahu's visit, orchestrated by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department, is seen as a diplomatic faux pas. The move is widely perceived as an attempt to derail Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, a key foreign policy objective. The visit has sparked outrage among Democrats, with Vice President Biden and several lawmakers announcing they will boycott the speech. Republicans, on the other hand, have defended the move, accusing the administration of being more concerned with politics in Israel than the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran. The incident has exposed deep partisan divisions in Washington.
