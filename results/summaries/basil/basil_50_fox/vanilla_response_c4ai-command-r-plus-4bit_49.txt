SUMMARY: National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress could damage long-standing bipartisan U.S.-Israel relations. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, a breach of diplomatic protocol, to address concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The visit has strained relations between President Obama and Netanyahu, with U.S. officials believing Netanyahu aims to derail a potential nuclear deal with Iran. Rice's comments reflect the administration's growing frustration with Netanyahu's visit. Netanyahu also declined an invitation to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats, citing concerns about partisanship. Vice President Biden and several Democratic lawmakers plan to boycott Netanyahu's speech, while some Republicans view their absence as disrespectful to a key ally. This incident highlights the complex dynamics between the U.S. and Israel, with potential implications for future relations.
