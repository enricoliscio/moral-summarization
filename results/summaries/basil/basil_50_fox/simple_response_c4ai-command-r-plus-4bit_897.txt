SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Capitol Hill has sparked controversy and added political acrimony to already strained US-Israel relations. House Speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu without consulting the White House or State Department, a breach of diplomatic protocol. National Security Adviser Susan Rice warns that the speech will be "destructive" to the longstanding bipartisan nature of the relationship between the two countries. Netanyahu's visit is seen as an attempt to derail a potential nuclear deal with Iran, a key foreign policy objective for the Obama administration. There is a growing boycott of Netanyahu's speech by Democratic lawmakers, who view it as an affront to the President and the ongoing negotiations with Iran. The episode highlights the complex and delicate nature of international relations and the importance of respecting diplomatic protocols to maintain constructive relationships between nations.
