SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill address could be a "destructive" force in long-standing U.S.-Israel relations, adding more political acrimony to the already contentious visit. The visit, orchestrated by House Speaker John Boehner without conferring with the White House or State Department, has further challenged the strained relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. Rice emphasized the importance of maintaining a bipartisan approach, stating that Netanyahu's speech could "compound the misperception of partisanship" and undermine the fabric of the relationship. Netanyahu's refusal to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats has been seen as an affront to the administration, with many Democrats boycotting the event. The visit is widely seen as an attempt to derail a nuclear deal with Iran, a signature Obama foreign policy objective. The situation has sparked strong reactions, with Vice President Biden and several Democrats skipping the event, while Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham called Biden's absence "appalling and unacceptable." END OF SUMMARY.
