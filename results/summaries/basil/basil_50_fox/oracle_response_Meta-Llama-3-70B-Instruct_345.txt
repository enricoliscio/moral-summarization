SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill address will be a "destructive" force in long-standing U.S.-Israel relations, adding more political acrimony to the already contentious visit. The visit has further challenged the strained relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu, with Rice stating that it's "destructive to the fabric of the relationship" and emphasizing the need to keep it bipartisan. Netanyahu's refusal to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats has been seen as an attempt to "derail" a nuclear deal with Iran, a signature Obama foreign policy objective. U.S. officials suggest that Netanyahu's trip is aimed primarily at influencing the negotiations, which has been perceived as a partisan move. The visit has been met with opposition from several Democrats, with Vice President Biden and over a half-dozen House and Senate Democrats announcing that they will skip the event, calling it an affront to Obama and the administration. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, however, called Biden's absence "appalling and unacceptable".

END OF SUMMARY.
