SUMMARY: National Security Adviser Susan Rice asserts that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Capitol Hill will be "destructive" to the fabric of the U.S.-Israel relationship, which has traditionally been bipartisan. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, without consulting the White House or State Department, a breach of diplomatic protocol. Boehner justifies his invitation by claiming that Netanyahu will address the threat of Iran's nuclear program, which is currently being negotiated by Washington and Tehran. Rice's comments reflect the Obama administration's increasing frustration with Netanyahu's visit, which is seen as a challenge to the already strained relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. Netanyahu's trip is viewed by U.S. officials as an attempt to undermine a potential nuclear deal with Iran, a key foreign policy goal for Obama. The visit has sparked political acrimony, with Vice President Biden and several Democratic lawmakers refusing to attend Netanyahu's speech, while Republican Senator Lindsey Graham criticizes their absence. Meanwhile, Netanyahu turns down an invitation to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats, expressing regret that his visit has been perceived as partisan. Senator Dick Durbin expresses disappointment that Netanyahu refused to meet, stating that the offer was intended to balance the politically divisive invitation from Boehner.
END OF SUMMARY.
