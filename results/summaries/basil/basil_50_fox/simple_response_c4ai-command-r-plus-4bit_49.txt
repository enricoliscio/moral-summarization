SUMMARY: National Security Adviser Susan Rice asserts that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming speech at Capitol Hill, which was arranged without consulting the White House or State Department, will harm the bipartisan nature of the US-Israel relationship. Rice's comments reflect the Obama administration's growing frustration with Netanyahu's visit, which is seen as a partisan move to undermine nuclear negotiations with Iran. Netanyahu's refusal to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats further exacerbates tensions, with some Democrats viewing it as a snub. Vice President Biden and several Democrats plan to boycott the speech, while Republicans defend Netanyahu's visit as an opportunity to hear from an important ally. This incident highlights the complex dynamics and ethical dilemmas surrounding international relations and the pursuit of national interests.
END OF SUMMARY.
