SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress will be "destructive" to US-Israel relations. Rice's comments are the Obama administration's toughest on the issue, which has sparked controversy due to Netanyahu's invitation by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department. The visit has strained relations between President Obama and Netanyahu, with tensions rising on all sides. Netanyahu has declined an invitation to meet with Senate Democrats, citing concerns about partisanship. US officials believe Netanyahu's trip aims to derail a nuclear deal with Iran, a key Obama foreign policy objective. Vice President Biden and several House and Senate Democrats will skip the event, calling it an affront to Obama and the administration.

END OF SUMMARY.
