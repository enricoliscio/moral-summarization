SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill address will be a "destructive" force in long-standing U.S.-Israel relations, adding more political acrimony to the already "strained" relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. The visit, orchestrated by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department, has been deemed a "diplomatic no-no". Rice's statements were among the Obama administration's "tough" on Netanyahu's speech, set for March 3. Netanyahu's refusal to meet with leading Senate Democrats has been seen as "disappointing" and "appalling" by some, while others view it as a "grave" concern for Israel's survival. The visit has been perceived as an "affront" to Obama and the administration as they negotiate with Iran over its nuclear program. END OF SUMMARY.
