Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points. 

The article is about Susan Rice, the National Security Adviser, warning that Netanyahu's upcoming speech in the U.S. Capitol could harm U.S.-Israel relations. She calls it a "destructive" force. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker Boehner, a Republican, without consulting the White House or State Department first, which is seen as a diplomatic issue.

The reason Boehner gave was to address the nuclear threat from Iran, especially with ongoing negotiations. However, this visit is causing strain between Obama and Netanyahu. Rice emphasized the importance of keeping U.S.-Israel relations bipartisan.

Netanyahu declined to meet with Senate Democrats, saying he didn't want to be seen as partisan. He wrote a letter explaining his intention was to voice concerns about the nuclear deal with Iran, which he sees as a threat. U.S. officials think he's trying to derail the nuclear deal, a key Obama policy.

There's tension on both sides. Biden isn't attending the speech, and several Democrats are skipping it, calling it disrespectful. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham criticized Biden's absence, calling it unacceptable. Durbin expressed disappointment that Netanyahu wouldn't meet with Democrats, saying it could have balanced the partisan invitation.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Rice's warning, the invitation by Boehner without consultation, the context of Iran nuclear talks, Netanyahu's refusal to meet Democrats, the impact on U.S.-Israel relations, and the political tensions surrounding the visit.

Let me structure it: start with Rice's warning, mention Boehner's invitation and its diplomatic implications. Then talk about Netanyahu's purpose, the strained relations with Obama, the refusal to meet Democrats, and the political fallout including Biden and Graham's reactions. End with the broader implications for U.S.-Israel relations.

I need to keep it concise, making sure each sentence covers a key point without getting too detailed. Avoiding any markdown, just plain text. Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's under 200.

Okay, I think I've got all the main elements. Time to put it together clearly and succinctly.
