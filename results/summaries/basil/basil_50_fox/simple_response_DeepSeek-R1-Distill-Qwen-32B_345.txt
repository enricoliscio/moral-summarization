Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I should focus on the key points while highlighting the ethical or moral dimensions involved.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main events. Susan Rice, the National Security Adviser, is warning that Netanyahu's speech will be destructive to U.S.-Israel relations. Netanyahu was invited by Boehner without consulting the White House, which is a diplomatic issue. The article mentions that Boehner wanted Netanyahu to talk about Iran's nuclear threat, but this visit is causing strain between Obama and Netanyahu. Rice emphasizes that the relationship should remain bipartisan, and the administration is concerned about the speech's impact.

Then, Netanyahu refused to meet with Senate Democrats, saying it might look partisan. He claims his intention was to voice concerns about the nuclear deal. U.S. officials think he's trying to derail the nuclear talks, which are a big priority for Obama. The negotiations are making progress, but Israel fears the deal would let Iran get close to a nuclear weapon. Biden isn't attending the speech, and some Democrats are skipping it, but Republicans like Graham are upset, calling it disrespectful.

I need to capture the moral issues here. The key moral points are about the integrity of U.S.-Israel relations, the partisanship in politics, the potential undermining of diplomatic efforts, and respect for the process. Susan Rice's concern about the bipartisan nature is a moral stance on how relations should be maintained. Netanyahu's refusal to meet with Democrats might be seen as avoiding partisanship, but it's also a missed opportunity to balance the invitation. The Democrats skipping the speech shows their disapproval of the political move, while Republicans see it as disrespect.

I should structure the summary to highlight these moral aspects: the damage to the relationship, the partisanship issue, Netanyahu's intentions versus the perception, and the political fallout from the event. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures the essence without losing the moral framing.

Rice emphasized the need to maintain bipartisan support for the U.S.-Israel relationship, while Netanyahu denied partisanship, stating his goal was to voice concerns over Iran's nuclear threat.

Biden and several Democrats are skipping the speech, while Republicans like Lindsey Graham criticized this as disrespectful. The visit has deepened political tensions, highlighting the ethical dilemma of balancing national security with partisan politics. END OF SUMMARY.
