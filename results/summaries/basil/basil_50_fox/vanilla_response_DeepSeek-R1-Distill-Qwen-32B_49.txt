Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Susan Rice, the National Security Adviser, warning that Netanyahu's upcoming speech in the U.S. Capitol will harm U.S.-Israel relations. She calls it "destructive." Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker Boehner without consulting the White House, which is a diplomatic issue. Boehner wanted Netanyahu to talk about Iran's nuclear threat during ongoing negotiations.

Rice mentions that the relationship has always been bipartisan and needs to stay that way. This is one of the toughest statements from the Obama administration about Netanyahu's speech. Previously, they had a low-key stance, saying Obama wouldn't meet Netanyahu to avoid influencing Israel's elections. But now tensions are rising.

Netanyahu declined a meeting with Senate Democrats, saying it might be seen as partisan. He wrote a letter saying his intention was to voice concerns about Iran's nuclear deal. U.S. officials think his visit is to derail the nuclear deal, which is a key policy for Obama. Netanyahu is skeptical of the negotiations and thinks Obama is making concessions that would let Iran build a nuclear weapon.

The article mentions progress in negotiations but Israeli warnings that the deal would make Iran a nuclear threshold state. Biden won't attend the speech, and several Democrats are skipping it, calling it disrespectful. Republican Sen. Graham criticizes Biden's absence, calling it unacceptable and showing disrespect. Durbin regrets Netanyahu's refusal to meet, saying it's a missed opportunity to balance the invitation.

So, the summary needs to capture the key points: Rice's warning, the diplomatic issue of the invitation, Netanyahu's purpose, the impact on U.S.-Israel relations, the nuclear deal context, and the political reactions from both parties.

I need to condense this into under 200 words, making sure to include all main points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step.

First, mention Rice's warning and the invitation without consulting the White House. Then, Netanyahu's purpose and the criticism from Rice. Next, the administration's previous stance and rising tensions. Then, Netanyahu's refusal to meet Democrats and his reasoning. Follow with the U.S. officials' view on his intent and the nuclear deal context. Finally, the political reactions, including Biden's absence and the Democrats skipping the event, as well as Republican criticism.

I should make sure each sentence is concise and covers each main point without overlapping. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.
