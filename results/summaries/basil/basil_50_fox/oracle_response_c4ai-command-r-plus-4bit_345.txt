SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Capitol Hill has added political acrimony to the already contentious visit. House Speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu without conferring with the White House or State Department, a move that is generally considered a diplomatic faux pas. The visit has further strained the relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu, with National Security Adviser Susan Rice calling it "destructive to the fabric of the relationship." Rice's comments reflect the Obama administration's tough stance on Netanyahu's speech, which they see as an attempt to derail a nuclear deal with Iran. Netanyahu has rejected claims of partisanship, stating that his sole intention is to voice Israel's concerns about the potential nuclear threat from Iran. However, U.S. officials suggest that Netanyahu's trip is aimed at undermining a signature Obama foreign policy objective. The visit has also sparked tensions among lawmakers, with some Democrats calling it an affront to the Obama administration and boycotting the speech, while Republicans defend Netanyahu's presence as an opportunity to hear from a key ally about a common threat. This episode highlights the challenges of maintaining bipartisan support for Israel and the potential influence of political considerations on international relations.
