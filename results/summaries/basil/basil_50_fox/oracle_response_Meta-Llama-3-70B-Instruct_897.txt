SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill address will be a "destructive" force in long-standing U.S.-Israel relations, adding more political acrimony to the already contentious visit. Rice stated that the visit is "destructive to the fabric of the relationship" and that it's essential to keep it bipartisan. Netanyahu's refusal to meet with leading Senate Democrats has been seen as a partisan move, aimed at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran. U.S. officials believe Netanyahu's trip is primarily aimed at influencing the negotiations, which could threaten the survival of Israel. The visit has been perceived as an affront to President Obama and the administration, with Vice President Biden and several House and Senate Democrats announcing they will skip the event. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham called Biden's absence "appalling and unacceptable," stating that it shows complete disrespect to Israel and the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran. END OF SUMMARY.
