Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Susan Rice, the National Security Adviser, warning that Netanyahu's Capitol Hill speech will harm U.S.-Israel relations. She's critical because Boehner invited Netanyahu without consulting the White House, which is a diplomatic no-no. Boehner wanted Netanyahu to talk about Iran's nuclear threat, but this move is causing political tensions, especially between Obama and Netanyahu.

Netanyahu's visit is seen as trying to derail the nuclear deal with Iran, which is a key Obama policy. Netanyahu is skeptical of the negotiations and thinks Obama is making too many concessions. The negotiations are making progress, but Israel is worried the deal would let Iran get close to a nuclear weapon.

There's also some political fallout: Biden won't attend the speech, and several Democrats are skipping it, while some Republicans are upset about that. Netanyahu turned down a meeting with Senate Democrats, saying he didn't want to seem partisan, but the Democrats are disappointed.

I need to capture the moral aspects here. The article frames the visit as a political maneuver that's harming the relationship. It's about partisanship, diplomacy, and the impact on U.S.-Israel relations. Susan Rice is emphasizing the bipartisan nature and the negative impact of the visit. Netanyahu is portrayed as trying to influence U.S. policy against the administration's efforts.

I should make sure to include the key points: Rice's warning, the diplomatic issue with Boehner inviting Netanyahu without consulting, the nuclear negotiations, Netanyahu's opposition, the political fallout with Biden and Democrats skipping, and Netanyahu's refusal to meet with Democrats.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral framing is clear—emphasizing the negative impact on relations and the partisanship involved.

Let me structure this: start with Rice's warning, mention the diplomatic issue, Netanyahu's purpose, the impact on Obama-Netanyahu relationship, the nuclear negotiations, the political divide, and the refusal to meet with Democrats.

Make sure to highlight the tension between the two sides and the potential harm to the relationship. Also, note the criticism from both sides—Democrats skipping and Republicans being upset.

I think that's the main points. Now, I'll condense this into a concise summary, making sure to include all these elements without exceeding the word limit.
