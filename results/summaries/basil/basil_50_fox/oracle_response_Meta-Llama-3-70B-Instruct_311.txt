SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill address will be a "destructive" force in long-standing U.S.-Israel relations, adding more political acrimony to the already contentious visit. Rice's comments were among the Obama administration's toughest on Netanyahu's speech, set for March 3, which has further challenged the strained relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. The visit, though, has been perceived as a partisan move, with Netanyahu turning down an invitation to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats, saying such a session could "compound the misperception of partisanship" surrounding his visit. U.S. officials suggest Netanyahu's trip is aimed primarily at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, a signature Obama foreign policy objective. Vice President Biden won't attend the Netanyahu speech, and more than a half-dozen House and Senate Democrats also have said they will skip the event, calling it an affront to Obama and the administration as they negotiate with Iran over its nuclear program.

END OF SUMMARY.
