Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Susan Rice, the National Security Adviser, warning that Netanyahu's upcoming speech in the U.S. Capitol will be destructive to U.S.-Israel relations. She's emphasizing the bipartisan nature of the relationship and the importance of maintaining it. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker Boehner without consulting the White House, which is seen as a diplomatic faux pas. The visit is causing strain between Obama and Netanyahu, especially since Obama isn't meeting him, supposedly to avoid influencing Israel's elections.

Rice's comments are some of the strongest from the Obama administration, indicating the administration's concern. Netanyahu refused to meet with Senate Democrats, saying he didn't want to be seen as partisan. He claims his intention was to voice Israel's concerns about a nuclear deal with Iran, which he fears would leave Iran close to building a nuclear weapon.

The article also mentions that Biden and several Democrats are skipping Netanyahu's speech, while Republicans like Lindsey Graham are upset, calling Biden's absence disrespectful. There's tension on all sides, with Netanyahu's visit seen as an attempt to derail the nuclear negotiations, a key priority for Obama.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the moral aspects. The main moral points are the potential damage to U.S.-Israel relations, the partisanship involved, Netanyahu's refusal to meet Democrats to avoid appearing partisan, and the differing political reactions from Democrats and Republicans.

I should structure the summary to highlight these points, ensuring that the moral framing is clear. I'll mention Rice's warning, the bipartisan concern, Netanyahu's refusal, the political divide, and the implications for the nuclear talks and U.S.-Israel relations.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure it's concise and captures all the key moral elements without exceeding the word limit.
