SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill address will be a "destructive" force in long-standing U.S.-Israel relations, adding more political acrimony to the already contentious visit. The visit, orchestrated by House Speaker John Boehner without conferring with the White House or State Department, has further challenged the strained relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. Rice emphasized the importance of maintaining a bipartisan approach, stating that Netanyahu's speech "is destructive to the fabric of the relationship." Netanyahu's refusal to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats has been perceived as a partisan move, aimed at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, a signature Obama foreign policy objective. The visit has been met with opposition from several Democrats, who view it as an affront to Obama and the administration, while Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham called Vice President Biden's absence "appalling and unacceptable." The controversy surrounding the visit has highlighted the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran and the need for bipartisan cooperation.

END OF SUMMARY.
