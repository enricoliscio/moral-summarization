SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress will be a "destructive" force in U.S.-Israel relations, adding to the political acrimony surrounding the already contentious visit. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, without consulting the White House or State Department, a diplomatic no-no. Boehner claims the goal is to address the Iranian nuclear threat amid negotiations with Washington. However, the visit has further strained President Obama's relationship with Netanyahu. Rice's comments reflect the administration's toughest stance yet, with tensions rising on both sides. Netanyahu rejected a private meeting with leading Senate Democrats, stating that he regrets any partisan perception of his visit. U.S. officials believe Netanyahu aims to derail a nuclear deal with Iran, an important Obama foreign policy objective. Netanyahu's opposition has intensified due to perceived concessions by Obama. Israeli officials warn that such a deal could make Iran a nuclear threshold state. Vice President Biden and several Democrats will boycott the speech, calling it an affront to Obama and the administration's negotiations with Iran. Some Republicans criticize these boycotts as disrespectful and partisan. Senator Dick Durbin expressed disappointment in Netanyahu's refusal to meet with Democrats, stating that it was an attempt to balance the partisan invitation. END OF SUMMARY.
