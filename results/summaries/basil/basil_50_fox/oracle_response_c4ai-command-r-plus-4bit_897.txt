SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Capitol Hill has sparked controversy and political acrimony, with National Security Adviser Susan Rice warning that it will be "destructive" to the long-standing bipartisan U.S.-Israel relationship. House Speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu without conferring with the White House or State Department, a move seen as a diplomatic breach of protocol. Boehner maintains that he wants Netanyahu to address the threat of Iran's nuclear program amid ongoing negotiations with Tehran. The visit has further strained the relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. Rice's comments reflect the Obama administration's tough stance on Netanyahu's speech, with concerns raised about the visit's potential influence on Israel's tight elections. Netanyahu has rejected an invitation to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats, citing concerns about partisanship. U.S. officials believe Netanyahu's trip is aimed at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, a key Obama foreign policy objective. While Netanyahu opposes concessions that could bring Iran closer to a nuclear weapon, U.S. and Iranian officials are making progress toward a potential deal. Israeli officials warn that such a deal could make Iran a nuclear threshold state. Vice President Biden and several Democratic lawmakers plan to boycott the speech, calling it an affront to the administration's negotiations with Iran. END OF SUMMARY.
