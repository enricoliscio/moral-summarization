SUMMARY: National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress could damage long-standing bipartisan U.S.-Israel relations. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, a move that has added political tension to the visit. Rice called the move "destructive" and emphasized the need for bipartisanship in U.S.-Israel relations. Netanyahu's visit is seen as an attempt to derail a potential nuclear deal with Iran, a key foreign policy objective of the Obama administration. Tensions have risen as Vice President Biden and several Democratic lawmakers plan to boycott the speech, while some Republicans criticize their absence. Netanyahu also declined an invitation to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats, citing concerns about partisanship. The incident highlights the strained relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu, with U.S. officials suggesting Netanyahu is focused on derailing the Iran nuclear negotiations. Israeli officials warn that a potential deal could leave Iran as a nuclear threshold state, while U.S. officials report progress in negotiations.
