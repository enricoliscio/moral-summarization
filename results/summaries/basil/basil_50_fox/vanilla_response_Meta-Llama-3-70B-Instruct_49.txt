SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress will be "destructive" to US-Israel relations. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department, a move considered a diplomatic faux pas. The visit has further strained the relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. Rice's comments are among the administration's toughest on the speech, set for March 3. Netanyahu has turned down an invitation to meet privately with Senate Democrats, saying it could "compound the misperception of partisanship" surrounding his visit. US officials suggest Netanyahu's trip is aimed at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, a signature Obama foreign policy objective. Vice President Biden and several House and Senate Democrats will skip the event, calling it an affront to Obama and the administration.

END OF SUMMARY.
