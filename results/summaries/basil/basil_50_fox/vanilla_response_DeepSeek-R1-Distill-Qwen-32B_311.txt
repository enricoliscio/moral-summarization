Alright, so the user has given me a task where I need to summarize a news article. They want the summary to be concise, no more than 200 words, and to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Susan Rice, the National Security Adviser, warning that Netanyahu's speech in the US Capitol could harm US-Israel relations. She calls it destructive because it's a political move without consulting the White House. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker Boehner, a Republican, which is seen as a diplomatic issue. The visit is causing tension between Obama and Netanyahu, especially regarding the nuclear talks with Iran. Rice emphasizes the need for bipartisan support in US-Israel relations. Netanyahu declined a meeting with Senate Democrats to avoid appearing partisan. Some US officials think the visit is to derail the Iran nuclear deal, which is a key priority for Obama. There's also mention of Biden not attending the speech, and some Democrats boycotting it, while Republicans like Lindsey Graham are upset about Biden's absence. Durbin expresses regret that Netanyahu didn't meet with Democrats, suggesting it could have balanced the political divide.

Now, I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key elements: Rice's warning, Netanyahu's speech invitation, the diplomatic issues, the impact on US-Israel relations, the nuclear talks with Iran, Netanyahu's refusal to meet Democrats, the political fallout, and the differing reactions from Democrats and Republicans.

I should make sure to include the main actors: Susan Rice, Netanyahu, Boehner, Obama, Biden, Lindsey Graham, and Dick Durbin. Also, the implications for the nuclear deal and the strained relationship between Obama and Netanyahu are crucial points.

I'll structure the summary by first introducing Rice's warning, then the context of Netanyahu's invitation, the diplomatic no-no aspect, the impact on the relationship, Netanyahu's refusal to meet Democrats, the purpose of the visit to derail the nuclear deal, and the reactions from both parties in the US Congress.

I need to keep it clear and concise, making sure each sentence covers a main point without going into too much detail. I'll avoid any unnecessary information and stick to the essential elements that show the conflict and its implications.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words and that it flows logically from one point to the next. I'll make sure to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed.

Netanyahu, invited by Republican House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, aims to address concerns about Iran's nuclear threat. Rice emphasized the need to maintain bipartisan support for the U.S.-Israel relationship, which has been strained under President Obama. Netanyahu declined to meet with Senate Democrats, citing concerns about appearing partisan. U.S. officials believe the visit is aimed at derailing nuclear negotiations with Iran, a key Obama administration priority. Netanyahu opposes the potential deal, fearing it could leave Iran close to developing a nuclear weapon. Some Democrats are boycotting the speech, while Republicans, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, criticize Biden's absence as disrespectful. Netanyahu's refusal to meet with Democrats has disappointed long-time supporters of Israel. END OF SUMMARY.
