SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress will be "destructive" to US-Israel relations. The visit, arranged by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department, has added to the already strained relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. Rice's comments are the Obama administration's toughest on the issue, with tensions rising on all sides. Netanyahu has declined an invitation to meet with Senate Democrats, citing concerns about partisanship. US officials believe Netanyahu's trip aims to derail a nuclear deal with Iran, a key Obama foreign policy objective. Vice President Biden and several House and Senate Democrats will skip the event, calling it an affront to Obama and the administration. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham criticized Biden's absence, calling it "appalling and unacceptable."

END OF SUMMARY.
