SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill address could be "destructive" to the long-standing U.S.-Israel relations. The visit, orchestrated by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department, has sparked political acrimony and further strained the relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. Rice emphasized the importance of maintaining a bipartisan approach to the U.S.-Israel relationship, which is being compromised by Netanyahu's visit. The Obama administration has expressed concerns that Netanyahu's trip is aimed at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, a key foreign policy objective. Meanwhile, Vice President Biden and several House and Senate Democrats have announced they will skip the event, citing disrespect to the administration and its negotiations with Iran. The controversy highlights the partisan divisions and diplomatic tensions surrounding Netanyahu's visit.
