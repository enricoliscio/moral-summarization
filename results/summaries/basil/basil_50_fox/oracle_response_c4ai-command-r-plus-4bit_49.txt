SUMMARY: National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress is "destructive" to the longstanding bipartisan U.S.-Israel relationship. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John Boehner without conferring with the White House or State Department, a breach of diplomatic protocol. Boehner maintains that he wanted Netanyahu to address the threat of Iran's nuclear program amid negotiations with Tehran. Rice's comments reflect the Obama administration's increasing tensions with Netanyahu, who they believe is trying to derail a potential nuclear deal with Iran. Netanyahu rejected an invitation to meet with leading Senate Democrats, stating that his sole intention is to voice Israel's concerns about the potential nuclear threat from Iran. U.S. officials suggest Netanyahu's trip is politically motivated and aimed at undermining Obama's foreign policy objectives. While some Democrats plan to boycott Netanyahu's speech, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called the absence of Vice President Biden "appalling and unacceptable." The situation highlights the complex dynamics of international relations and the challenges of maintaining bipartisan support for foreign policy initiatives.
END OF SUMMARY.
