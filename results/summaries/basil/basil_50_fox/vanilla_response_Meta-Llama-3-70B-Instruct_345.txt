SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress will be "destructive" to US-Israel relations. The visit, arranged by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House or State Department, has sparked controversy and strained relations between President Obama and Netanyahu. Rice's comments are among the Obama administration's toughest on the issue, emphasizing the need to keep US-Israel relations bipartisan. Netanyahu has declined an invitation to meet privately with Senate Democrats, citing concerns about perceptions of partisanship. The visit is seen as an attempt to derail a nuclear deal with Iran, a key Obama foreign policy objective. Vice President Biden and several House and Senate Democrats will boycott the speech, while Republicans have criticized the administration's response. The controversy has highlighted the deepening rift between the US and Israel on the Iran nuclear issue.
