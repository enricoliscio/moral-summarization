SUMMARY: 
National Security Advisor Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress will be "destructive" to the longstanding bipartisan U.S.-Israel relationship. This warning adds to the moral acrimony surrounding Netanyahu's visit, which was arranged without the White House's knowledge and has strained an already tense relationship with President Obama. Netanyahu's sole intention, he claims, is to voice concerns about the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran and to derail what he sees as Obama's willingness to make concessions in negotiations with Tehran. U.S. officials suggest that Netanyahu's opposition is politically motivated and challenges Obama's signature foreign policy objective of achieving a nuclear deal with Iran. The moral assault on Netanyahu's visit is bipartisan, with Vice President Biden and several Democrats refusing to attend the speech, calling it unacceptable and disrespectful to the office of the President. Despite these concerns, some Republicans like Senator Lindsey Graham defend Netanyahu, framing the issue as one of common threat and dismissing concerns about partisanship. Netanyahu's refusal to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats further disappointed those who have stood by Israel for decades, as it was seen as a partisan assault on the President and the administration.
