SUMMARY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Capitol Hill has sparked political acrimony and raised tensions between the US and Israel. National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that the speech, which was invited by House Speaker John Boehner without the usual diplomatic conferring with the White House or State Department, is "destructive" to the longstanding bipartisan relationship between the two countries. Netanyahu's visit is seen as an attempt to influence the ongoing negotiations between Washington and Tehran by derailing a potential nuclear deal, which he opposes. US officials suggest that Netanyahu's trip is aimed at undermining a signature Obama foreign policy objective. Netanyahu's refusal to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats during his trip has further fueled the perception of partisanship and threatened to compound the misperception of political influence. Vice President Biden and several Democrats have also decided to boycott the speech, calling it an affront to the administration and disrespectful. The situation has highlighted the strained relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu, with both sides expressing concerns about the potential consequences of the visit.
END OF SUMMARY.
