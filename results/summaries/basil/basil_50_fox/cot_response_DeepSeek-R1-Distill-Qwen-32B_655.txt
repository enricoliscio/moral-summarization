Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify all the single words that carry moral implications. Let me read through the article again to spot those words.

The article talks about Susan Rice warning that Netanyahu's speech is "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. That's a strong negative moral word. Then, it mentions Boehner inviting Netanyahu without consulting the White House, which is a "diplomatic no-no." "No-no" is a moral judgment. The visit is described as "contentious," another negative term. The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is "strained," which is a negative moral assessment.

Rice says the speech is "destructive" to the "fabric" of the relationship. "Fabric" here implies the underlying structure, which is a moral framework. The administration's stance is "low-key," but that's more descriptive than moral. The visit is "challenging" the relationship, which is a negative moral implication. Netanyahu's actions are seen as "derailing" the nuclear deal, a strong negative term. The opposition is "skeptical," which is a negative judgment. The deal would leave Iran on the "brink" of building a nuclear weapon, indicating a dangerous situation.

Netanyahu's refusal to meet with Democrats is "disappointing," a negative moral assessment. The speech is an "affront" to Obama, another strong negative term. Biden's absence is "appalling" and "unacceptable," both strong negative judgments. The refusal to meet is a "misperception of partisanship," which is a negative implication. The invitation is "perceived as political or partisan," which is a negative assessment. The speech is "divisive," a negative term. The absence of Biden and others shows "disrespect," a negative moral judgment. The nuclear deal is a "signature" objective, which is positive but not a single word. The threat is "grave" and "existential," both negative.

So, compiling all these, the morally framed words are: destructive, no-no, contentious, strained, fabric, low-key, challenging, derailing, skeptical, brink, disappointing, affront, appalling, unacceptable, misperception, perceived, divisive, disrespect, grave, existential.

Now, I need to write a summary using as many of these words as possible, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by outlining the main points: Rice's warning, Netanyahu's invitation, the diplomatic issue, the impact on U.S.-Israel relations, Netanyahu's refusal to meet Democrats, the nuclear deal, and the political fallout.

I'll structure the summary to include the key players, their actions, and the moral implications. Make sure to include words like "destructive," "contentious," "strained," "derailing," "disappointing," "affront," "appalling," "disrespect," "grave," and "existential."

I should ensure the summary flows well and covers all the main points without being too verbose. Let me draft it step by step, incorporating the morally framed words where appropriate.

**Summary:**  
National Security Adviser Susan Rice criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill speech as "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations, calling it a "contentious" and "divisive" move. Invited by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, Netanyahu's visit has strained the relationship between President Obama and Israel. Rice warned that the speech could harm the "fabric" of the bipartisan alliance, while Netanyahu's refusal to meet with Senate Democrats was "disappointing" and seen as "derailing" efforts to maintain a balanced approach. The visit is viewed as an "affront" to Obama's administration, with Vice President Biden and several Democrats skipping the event, a move deemed "appalling" by some Republicans. Netanyahu's opposition to the nuclear deal with Iran, seen as leaving Iran on the "brink" of a nuclear weapon, has heightened tensions. The situation underscores the "grave" and "existential" threat posed by a potential nuclear-armed Iran, with Netanyahu's actions perceived as "skeptical" of U.S. efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
