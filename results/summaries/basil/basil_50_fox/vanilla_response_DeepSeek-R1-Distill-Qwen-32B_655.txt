Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

So, Susan Rice, the National Security Adviser, is warning that Netanyahu's speech will harm U.S.-Israel relations. She says it's destructive because it's adding political tension. Netanyahu was invited by Boehner without consulting the White House, which is a diplomatic issue. Boehner wanted to address the Iran nuclear threat, but this move is causing problems between Obama and Netanyahu.

The article mentions that Rice's comments are some of the toughest from the Obama administration. Previously, they were more low-key, saying Obama wouldn't meet Netanyahu because of elections, but now tensions are rising. Netanyahu declined a meeting with Senate Democrats, saying it might look partisan. He wrote a letter explaining his concerns about the Iran deal.

U.S. officials think Netanyahu's visit is to derail the nuclear deal, which is a key priority for Obama. Netanyahu is skeptical of the negotiations and thinks Obama is making too many concessions, allowing Iran to get close to a nuclear weapon. There's progress in talks, but Israel warns it's a bad deal. Biden and some Democrats won't attend the speech, while Republicans like Graham criticize this absence as disrespectful.

Durbin regrets Netanyahu didn't meet with Democrats, seeing it as an opportunity to balance the political divide. The key points are the diplomatic issues, the impact on U.S.-Israel relations, Netanyahu's opposition to the Iran deal, and the political fallout on Capitol Hill.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting Susan Rice's warning, Netanyahu's visit, the political tensions, the nuclear deal concerns, and the reactions from both parties. Make sure to include the main actors and their positions clearly.
