Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've given me specific steps to follow. First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I have to write a concise summary using those words where possible. 

Let me start by reading the article carefully. It's about Susan Rice criticizing Netanyahu's visit as destructive to U.S.-Israel relations. There are mentions of political acrimony, a diplomatic no-no, partisanship, and so on. I need to pick out each morally charged word.

Next, I'll list each of these words. Words like "destructive," "acrimony," "no-no," "partisanship," "affront," "disrespect," "disappointing," "skepticism," "opposition," "concessions," "derail," "compromise," "balance," "divisive," "disgrace," "distrust," "undermining," "complicity," "betrayal," and "depravity." Each of these carries a moral judgment.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article, making sure to include as many of these moral words as possible. The key points are Rice's warning, Netanyahu's invitation without consulting the White House, the impact on Obama's relationship, the nuclear deal concerns, Biden's absence, and the political fallout. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, highlighting the moral aspects without exceeding 200 words.

I should ensure that the summary accurately reflects the article's content while emphasizing the moral framing. That way, it captures the tension and the various criticisms from both sides. I'll make sure to include the main actors and their actions, using the identified moral terms where appropriate.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's concise and meets the word limit. It should effectively convey the strained relations and the political maneuvering involved, all while preserving the moral language used in the original text.

**SUMMARY:**  
National Security Adviser Susan Rice criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill speech as "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations, citing political acrimony and partisanship. Netanyahu, invited by Republican Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, aims to oppose a nuclear deal with Iran, a key Obama administration objective. Rice warned that the visit risks undermining the bipartisan foundation of U.S.-Israel ties. Netanyahu declined to meet Senate Democrats, fearing it would exacerbate perceptions of partisanship. U.S. officials accused him of trying to derail the nuclear negotiations, while Netanyahu expressed concerns over Iran's potential nuclear threat. Vice President Biden and several Democrats boycotted the speech, calling it an affront to Obama's diplomacy, while Republicans criticized Biden's absence as disrespectful. The visit has deepened tensions between Obama and Netanyahu, highlighting divisions over Iran and the nuclear deal. END OF SUMMARY.
