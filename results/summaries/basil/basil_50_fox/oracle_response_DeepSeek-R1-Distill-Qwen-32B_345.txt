SUMMARY: National Security Adviser Susan Rice criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill address, calling it a "destructive" force in U.S.-Israel relations. Netanyahu, invited by House Speaker John Boehner without conferring with the White House, aims to address the nuclear threat from Iran. Rice emphasized the need to maintain bipartisan support for the relationship, warning that the visit could influence political dynamics and be perceived as partisan. Netanyahu declined to meet with Senate Democrats, expressing regret that his visit was seen as political. U.S. officials believe Netanyahu’s trip is aimed at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, a key Obama administration objective. Netanyahu opposes concessions that could allow Iran to build a nuclear weapon. Progress in nuclear talks with Iran was reported, but Israeli officials warned the deal could make Iran a nuclear threshold state. Vice President Biden and several Democrats will not attend the speech, calling it an affront to the administration. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham condemned Biden’s absence as unacceptable, arguing it disrespected Israel. Senate Democrats regret Netanyahu’s refusal to meet, noting their long-standing support for Israel. END OF SUMMARY.
