SUMMARY: Susan Rice, National Security Advisor, warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming speech at Capitol Hill would damage the long-standing bipartisan U.S.-Israel relationship. House Speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu without consulting the White House or State Department, a breach of diplomatic protocol. Netanyahu aims to address the Iranian nuclear threat during the ongoing negotiations between Washington and Tehran. Rice's comments reflect the Obama administration's increasing tensions with Netanyahu over his opposition to potential concessions to Iran. U.S. officials suggest Netanyahu's trip is intended to sabotage a potential nuclear deal with Iran, a key Obama foreign policy goal. Netanyahu rejected a meeting with leading Senate Democrats, citing concerns about partisanship. Vice President Biden and several Democrats will boycott Netanyahu's speech, viewing it as an affront to the administration's negotiations with Iran. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham criticized Biden's absence as disrespectful to Israel. This incident highlights the moral dilemma between upholding diplomatic protocol and addressing perceived threats to national security, with potential consequences for the U.S.-Israel relationship.
END OF SUMMARY.
