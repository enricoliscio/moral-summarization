SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan Rice issued a *warning* that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Capitol Hill will be *destructive* to US-Israel relations, adding *acrimony* to an already *contentious* visit. House Speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu without consulting the White House or State Department, a diplomatic breach, to address the Iranian nuclear threat during negotiations between Washington and Tehran. Netanyahu's visit has further strained President Obama and Netanyahu's relationship. Rice's comments reflect the administration's toughest stance yet on Netanyahu's speech, which has sparked rising *tensions*. Netanyahu turned down an invitation to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats, expressing *regret* that his visit had been perceived as partisan. Netanyahu's trip is seen as an attempt to *derail* a nuclear deal with Iran, a key Obama foreign policy objective. U.S. officials reported progress in negotiations with Iran, but Israeli officials warned that such a deal would leave Iran as a nuclear threshold state. Vice President Biden and several Democrats will boycott Netanyahu's speech, with some calling it a sign of *disrespect*. Despite *disappointment* from some senators, the invitation and subsequent refusal to meet privately have highlighted the political divide surrounding Netanyahu's visit.
END OF SUMMARY.
