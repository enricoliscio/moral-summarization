SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill address will be a "destructive" force in long-standing U.S.-Israel relations, adding more political acrimony to the already "contentious" visit. The visit has further challenged the "strained" relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. Rice's statements were among the Obama administration's "toughest" on Netanyahu's speech. Netanyahu turned down an invitation to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats, saying it could "compound the misperception of partisanship" surrounding his visit. U.S. officials suggest Netanyahu's trip is aimed primarily at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, a signature Obama foreign policy objective. Vice President Biden won't attend the Netanyahu speech, which some Democrats called an "affront" to Obama and the administration. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham called Biden's absence "appalling and unacceptable," showing "disrespect" to Israel. END OF SUMMARY.
