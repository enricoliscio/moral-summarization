Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Susan Rice, the National Security Adviser, warning that Netanyahu's speech in the U.S. Capitol could be destructive to U.S.-Israel relations. She mentions that it's a bipartisan issue and needs to stay that way. Netanyahu was invited by Speaker Boehner without consulting the White House, which is a diplomatic issue. Boehner wanted Netanyahu to address the Iran nuclear threat.

The visit is causing tension between Obama and Netanyahu. Rice's comments are some of the toughest from the Obama administration. They initially said Obama wouldn't meet Netanyahu because of Israel's elections, but now tensions are rising. Netanyahu refused to meet Senate Democrats, saying it might look partisan. He claims his intention was to voice concerns about the Iran deal.

U.S. officials think Netanyahu's visit is to derail the nuclear deal, which is a big priority for Obama. Netanyahu is skeptical of the negotiations and thinks Obama is making too many concessions. There's progress in talks, but Israel warns it's a bad deal. Biden and some Democrats won't attend the speech, which upsets some Republicans like Graham, who thinks it's disrespectful.

Durbin regrets Netanyahu not meeting with Democrats, saying it's a missed chance to balance the invitation.

So, the moral framing here is about the impact of Netanyahu's visit on U.S.-Israel relations, the partisanship involved, and the potential derailment of the Iran nuclear deal. I need to capture that in the summary without losing the moral perspective.

I should structure the summary to include Rice's warning, the diplomatic issue of Boehner's invitation, Netanyahu's refusal to meet Democrats, the potential impact on the Iran deal, and the political fallout on both sides.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all key points. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: National Security Adviser Susan Rice criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming Capitol Hill speech, warning it could harm U.S.-Israel relations. Invited by Republican Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, the visit is seen as a diplomatic misstep. Rice emphasized the need to maintain bipartisan support for the relationship. Netanyahu, who declined to meet Senate Democrats, claimed his intent was to address concerns about a potential Iran nuclear deal, which he opposes. U.S. officials view the visit as an attempt to derail the deal, a key Obama administration priority. Netanyahu's skepticism stems from concerns over concessions that could allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Progress in nuclear talks has been reported, but Israel warns against the deal. Vice President Biden and some Democrats will not attend Netanyahu's speech, drawing criticism from Republicans like Lindsey Graham. Netanyahu's refusal to meet Democrats disappointed some, highlighting the political divide. END OF SUMMARY.
