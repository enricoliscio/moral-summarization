Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Donald Trump causing controversy in the Republican primary. He's targeting Ted Cruz, but it's not just about Cruz; it's about their wives. Trump is using Twitter to attack Cruz by bringing up his wife's past depression and comparing photos of their wives. Cruz is responding by calling Trump a coward. The article also mentions the 2012 Todd Akin incident where Republicans distanced themselves from him after offensive remarks, but this time the media's reaction is less strong. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Trump's Twitter war against Cruz, the ad involving Melania, the attacks on Heidi Cruz, Cruz's response, and the comparison to the Akin situation. I should make sure it's clear and concise, highlighting the controversy and the potential impact on women voters. 

Let me structure it step by step. Start with Trump stirring controversy, mention the ad, his disbelief about Cruz's involvement, the attack on Heidi, the photo comparison, Cruz's reaction, and the media's muted response compared to Akin. Keep it all in one or two paragraphs. 

I should also ensure that the summary flows well and includes all key elements without getting too detailed. Maybe start with Trump's actions, then Cruz's response, and end with the comparison to Akin and the media's reaction. That should cover the main points succinctly.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has sparked controversy in the Republican presidential primary by escalating a Twitter war against Ted Cruz, focusing on their respective wives. Trump criticized Cruz over an ad by a "super PAC" opposing Trump, which included a photo of Melania Trump from a past nude photo shoot. Despite Cruz disavowing the ad, Trump continued to attack, threatening to reveal details about Heidi Cruz's past depression and sharing a photo comparison of the two women. Cruz responded by calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and demanding he stop targeting Heidi. The incident has raised concerns among party leaders that Trump's tactics could alienate women voters. This contrasts with the strong media and party reaction to Todd Akin's offensive remarks in 2012, where Republicans distanced themselves from him, while the current response to Trump's comments has been relatively muted. END OF SUMMARY.
