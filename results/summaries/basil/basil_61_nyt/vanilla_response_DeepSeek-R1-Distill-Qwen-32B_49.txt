Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, Trump is causing controversy in the Republican primary. He's targeting Ted Cruz with tweets, especially over an ad from a super PAC that included a nude photo of Melania Trump. Even though Cruz isn't involved with the PAC, Trump keeps questioning him. Trump even threatened to reveal info about Heidi Cruz's past depression and shared a photo comparing her to Melania, which upset Cruz.

Cruz called Trump a coward and told him to leave Heidi alone. The article also mentions the 2012 Todd Akin scandal where the Republican party isolated him after offensive remarks. Now, media reactions to Trump's actions are less harsh, but party leaders are worried about losing female voters.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Trump's actions, the ad, the personal attacks on Cruz's wife, Cruz's response, and the comparison to the Akin scandal with the implication for the party.

Let me structure this: Start with Trump's latest controversy, mention the ad, his tweets about Cruz's wife, Cruz's reaction, and the party's concern about women voters. Also, note the media's less severe response compared to Akin's case.

I should ensure the summary is concise and covers all key points without getting too detailed. Make sure to include the main actors, their actions, and the implications for the party and election.
