Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article is about Donald Trump's actions in the Republican primary, specifically how he's causing controversy by targeting Ted Cruz and his wife, Heidi. 

First, I should identify the key points. Trump is using Twitter to attack Cruz, focusing on his wife's past depression. He also retweeted a photo comparing Heidi and Melania, which seems to be a low blow. The author compares this to the 2012 Akin scandal, where the Republican party isolated a candidate for offensive remarks about women. The article suggests that Trump's tactics are similarly problematic and could alienate female voters.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspect. The author is critical of Trump's behavior, implying it's unethical and harmful to women. So, I should highlight how Trump's actions are targeting women, the comparison to Akin, and the potential negative impact on the party.

I'll start by stating Trump's actions, then mention the comparison to Akin, the impact on party leaders, and the moral concern about targeting women. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically.

Let me draft it: Trump escalated attacks on Cruz, targeting his wife, similar to Akin's scandal, raising concerns about women voters. The comparison shows the moral issue of attacking women in politics, which could hurt the party.

Wait, maybe I need to include more specifics, like the photo comparison and the use of personal issues. Also, mention that Cruz had enough and confronted Trump, showing the intensity of the situation.

I should structure it to show Trump's actions, the comparison, the effect on the party, and the moral implication. That should cover the main points while keeping the moral framing intact.
