Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Let me read through the article first. 

The article talks about how Trump is causing controversy in the Republican primary, worrying party leaders that he might drive women away from the party. He's been fighting with Ted Cruz over a super PAC ad that used Melania's old photo. Trump doesn't believe Cruz is unaffiliated with the PAC, even though Cruz denied it. Trump threatened to reveal info about Heidi Cruz's past depression and retweeted a photo comparing her and Melania. Cruz called him a coward and told him to leave Heidi alone. The article also compares this to the 2012 Todd Akin controversy, where the party distanced themselves, but this time the media's reaction is less strong.

So, the key points are: Trump's actions are causing concern about women voters; the super PAC ad with Melania's photo; Trump's attacks on Heidi Cruz; Cruz's response; comparison to Akin incident; media's subdued reaction.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

I should mention Trump's escalation against Cruz, the ad, his disbelief in Cruz's denial, the threats against Heidi, the photo comparison, Cruz's response, and the comparison to Akin. Also note the media's less strong reaction this time.

Let me structure it: Trump is causing concern by targeting Cruz and their wives, leading to fears about women voters. Mention the ad, Trump's disbelief, threats, photo comparison, Cruz's reaction, and the comparison to Akin, noting media's subdued response.

I think that covers all the main points without getting too detailed. Need to keep it concise.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has sparked controversy in the Republican primary by escalating a Twitter war against Ted Cruz over a super PAC ad featuring Melania Trump's old photo. Trump doubts Cruz's denial of involvement with the PAC and has threatened to reveal personal information about Heidi Cruz, including retweeting a photo comparing her and Melania. Cruz, after being heckled with quotes from "The American President," called Trump a "sniveling coward" and demanded he stop targeting Heidi. This situation has raised concerns among party leaders about alienating women voters, reminiscent of the 2012 Todd Akin controversy, though the media's reaction this time has been less intense. END OF SUMMARY.
