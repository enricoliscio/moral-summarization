SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has caused new controversy and alarm among Republican Party leaders, who fear that his actions as the front-runner for the presidential nomination will drive women away from the party in the upcoming election. Trump escalated a war of words against his main competitor, Ted Cruz, based on an ad by a super PAC featuring nude photos of Trump's wife, Melania. Despite Cruz having no affiliation with the ad and denouncing it, Trump continued to express disbelief and threatened to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, who had previously suffered from depression. Trump's offensive remarks and actions towards spouses, which are generally seen as off limits, have led to subdued responses from news media critics. This situation draws parallels to the outrage in 2012 when Todd Akin made offensive comments about "legitimate rape," resulting in the Republican Party isolating him. END OF SUMMARY.
