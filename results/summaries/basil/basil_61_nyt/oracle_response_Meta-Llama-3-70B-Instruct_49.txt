SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has sparked controversy and alarm among party leaders by escalating a war of words on Twitter against Senator Ted Cruz. The feud began with a super PAC ad featuring a nude photo of Trump's wife Melania, which Cruz denounced. However, Trump continued to express disbelief and threatened to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife Heidi, who has suffered from depression. Trump then retweeted a side-by-side photo comparison of the two women, prompting Cruz to defend his wife and call Trump a "sniveling coward." Trump's offensive comments have drawn comparisons to Todd Akin's 2012 remarks on "legitimate rape," which were widely condemned. Notably, the news media response to Trump's threats has been subdued, despite spouses generally being seen as off-limits in political discourse.

END OF SUMMARY.
