SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's recent Twitter attacks on Senator Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, have sparked controversy and alarm among Republican party leaders. Trump's threatening tone and unflattering comparisons of Heidi to his own wife, Melania, have been deemed offensive and cowardly. Despite Cruz's denouncement of a "super PAC" ad featuring a nude photo of Melania, Trump continued to escalate the war of words, leading Cruz to call him a "sniveling coward" and demand that he "leave Heidi the hell alone." The news media's response to Trump's comments has been surprisingly subdued, unlike the outrage sparked by Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" remark in 2012. The incident has raised concerns that Trump's behavior will drive away women voters from Republican candidates in the fall. END OF SUMMARY.
