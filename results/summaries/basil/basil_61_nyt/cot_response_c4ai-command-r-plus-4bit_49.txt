SUMMARY:
Donald Trump stirs up controversy and alarm among Republican Party leaders by escalating a conflict with Ted Cruz, his main competition in the presidential race, based on an ad by a super PAC. The ad featured an old nude photo shoot of Trump's wife, Melania, which Trump used to threaten Cruz's wife, Heidi, who had previously suffered from depression. Despite Cruz's denouncement of the ad and defense of his wife, Trump continued to express disbelief and retweeted a post with an unflattering photo comparison of the two women. Cruz finally responded by calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone." This incident draws parallels to the 2012 outrage over Todd Akin's comments about "legitimate rape," which was also offensive to women and led to efforts by the Republican Party to isolate him. However, the media's response to Trump's comments has been relatively subdued over time.
END OF SUMMARY.
