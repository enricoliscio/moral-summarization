SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, has escalated a war of words on Twitter against Senator Ted Cruz, his main competitor, over an ad featuring a nude photo shoot of Trump's wife Melania. Despite Cruz's denouncement of the ad, Trump continued to express disbelief and even threatened to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, who suffered from depression years ago. Trump then retweeted a post comparing Heidi Cruz to Melania Trump in an unflattering manner. Cruz defended his wife, calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone." This offensive behavior has sparked alarm among party leaders, who fear Trump's actions will drive away women voters in the fall. The news media's response to Trump's comments has been subdued compared to the outrage over Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" remark in 2012, highlighting the need for stronger condemnation of such behavior.

END OF SUMMARY.
