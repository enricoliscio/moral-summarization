SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's recent Twitter attacks on Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, have sparked outrage and alarm among Republican party leaders. Trump's actions, including retweeting an unflattering photo of Mrs. Cruz and threatening to "spill the beans" about her past depression, have been widely condemned as cowardly and offensive. The incident has drawn comparisons to the 2012 controversy surrounding Todd Akin's comments on "legitimate rape," which were also widely criticized as offensive to women. The fact that Trump's comments have received a more subdued response from the news media has raised concerns that he is being held to a different standard. The incident has also raised concerns that Trump's behavior will drive away women voters and harm Republican candidates down the ballot in the fall. As one critic noted, spouses are generally seen as off limits in political discourse, and Trump's actions have crossed a moral boundary.
