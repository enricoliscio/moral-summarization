SUMMARY: Donald Trump stirs up controversy in the Republican primary race, escalating a war of words against Ted Cruz based on an ad by a super PAC featuring nude photos of Trump's wife, Melania. Despite Cruz's lack of affiliation with the super PAC and his denouncement of the ad, Trump continues to express disbelief and threatens to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, who previously suffered from depression. Trump's retweet of a photo comparison of the two wives, along with his threats, sparks outrage and raises concerns among Republican leaders about driving women away from the party. The media's subdued response to Trump's offensive comments stands in contrast to the outrage generated by Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" remark in 2012, highlighting a double standard in the treatment of candidates' spouses. Cruz defends his wife and calls Trump a "sniveling coward," urging him to leave Heidi alone. The incident underscores the moral dilemma of balancing free speech with ethical boundaries in political discourse.
END OF SUMMARY.
