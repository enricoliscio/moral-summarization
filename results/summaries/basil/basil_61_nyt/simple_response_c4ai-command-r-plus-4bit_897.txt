SUMMARY: From his home at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump has escalated a war of words on Twitter with his Republican primary competitor, Ted Cruz, based on an ad by an anti-Trump super PAC that featured nude photos of Trump's wife, Melania. While Cruz has no affiliation with the super PAC and denounced the ad, Trump has continued to express disbelief and retaliated by threatening to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, who had previously suffered from depression. This led to a heated exchange between the two candidates, with Cruz calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and defending his wife. The media outrage over Trump's comments has been relatively subdued compared to the backlash against Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" remarks in 2012, raising questions about the treatment of spouses as "off limits" in political campaigns. Trump's actions may also have consequences for the Republican Party, as there is concern that his behavior will drive away women voters in the fall.
END OF SUMMARY.
