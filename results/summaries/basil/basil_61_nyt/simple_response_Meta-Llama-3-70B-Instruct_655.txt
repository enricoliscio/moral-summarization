SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has sparked outrage and concern among Republican party leaders by attacking his rival Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, on Twitter. Trump retweeted a post comparing an unflattering photo of Mrs. Cruz to a glamorous photo of his own wife, Melania. Despite Cruz's denunciation of the initial ad that sparked the controversy, Trump continued to threaten and insult Mrs. Cruz, who has a history of depression. Cruz finally responded, calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and demanding that he leave his wife alone. This incident has raised concerns that Trump's behavior will drive away women voters and harm Republican candidates down the ballot. The muted response from news media critics is notable, especially compared to the widespread outrage over Todd Akin's offensive comments in 2012. Trump's actions have crossed a moral line, violating the unwritten rule that spouses are off-limits in political attacks.

END OF SUMMARY.
