Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided specific morally charged words: escalated, war, comparison, threats, defended, offensive. I should make sure to include these in the summary.

The article talks about Trump and Cruz in the Republican primary. Trump is using Twitter to attack Cruz over an ad involving Melania's photo. He also made threats about Heidi Cruz's past depression. Cruz defended his wife, calling Trump a coward. The author compares this to the 2012 Akin scandal, where the media reacted strongly, but now the response is more subdued.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's actions, using the words escalated and war. Then mention the comparison and threats. Include Cruz defending his wife and the media's muted response. I should highlight the moral implications, like the comparison to Akin, showing a contrast in media reaction.

Let me structure it: Trump escalated a war via Twitter, comparing Melania and Heidi, making offensive threats. Cruz defended his wife, leading to Trump's attacks. Media's muted response contrasts with the strong reaction in 2012. Emphasize the off-limits nature of spouses in politics.

I think that covers all the points while preserving the moral framing. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. I'll make sure each sentence is concise and includes the necessary morally charged words.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has escalated a war of words on Twitter against Ted Cruz, his Republican rival, over an ad targeting Melania Trump, which Trump claims Cruz is involved with despite denials. Trump has made offensive comparisons and threats, including referencing Heidi Cruz's past depression. Cruz defended his wife, calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and demanding he "leave Heidi the hell alone." The situation has drawn comparisons to the 2012 Todd Akin scandal, where Akin's offensive remarks about rape led to widespread outrage and Republican distancing. However, the media's response to Trump's actions has been far more subdued, highlighting the contrast in how such behavior is perceived today. END OF SUMMARY.
