SUMMARY:
Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has sparked controversy and alarm among party leaders by engaging in a war of words with Senator Ted Cruz on Twitter. Trump's attacks on Cruz's wife, Heidi, have been widely condemned as offensive and cowardly. Despite Cruz's denunciation of a super PAC ad featuring a nude photo of Trump's wife Melania, Trump has continued to threaten and belittle Heidi Cruz, even retweeting an unflattering photo comparison of the two women. Cruz has had enough, calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone." The news media's response to Trump's comments has been surprisingly subdued, in contrast to the outrage sparked by Todd Akin's remarks on "legitimate rape" in 2012. Trump's behavior is seen as a potential liability for the Republican party, driving away women voters in the fall.
END OF SUMMARY.
