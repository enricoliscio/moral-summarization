SUMMARY: This week, Donald Trump stirred up controversy in the Republican presidential primary by escalating a feud with Ted Cruz based on an ad by a super PAC that featured nude photos of Trump's wife, Melania. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, who had suffered from depression, and retweeted a post with unflattering photos of both women. Cruz defended his wife and called Trump a "sniveling coward," telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone." The media outrage over Trump's comments has been relatively subdued compared to similar incidents in the past, such as Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" remark in 2012, raising concerns among Republican leaders that Trump's behavior could drive away women voters in the general election.
END OF SUMMARY.
