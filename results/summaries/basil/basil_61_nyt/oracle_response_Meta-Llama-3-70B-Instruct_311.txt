SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has escalated a war of words on Twitter against Ted Cruz, his main competitor in the Republican presidential primary, over an ad featuring a nude photo shoot of Trump's wife Melania. Despite Cruz's denouncement of the ad, Trump has continued to make threats against Cruz's wife, Heidi, who has suffered from depression in the past. Trump's actions have been widely condemned as offensive, with many calling him a "sniveling coward" for attacking Heidi. The incident has sparked alarm among party leaders, who fear that Trump's behavior will drive away women voters in the fall. The response from news media critics has been subdued compared to the outrage sparked by Todd Akin's comments in 2012, which were also deemed offensive. Spouses are generally seen as off-limits in political attacks, and Trump's actions have been widely criticized as a violation of this unwritten rule.

END OF SUMMARY.
