SUMMARY: This week, Donald Trump escalated a war of words with Ted Cruz, his main competition in the Republican presidential primary race, by threatening to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, who had previously suffered from depression. Trump's comments, which included a retweet with an unflattering photo comparison of Heidi Cruz and his own wife, Melania, a former model, sparked alarm among Republican leaders who fear that such offensive behavior will drive women away from the party in the fall. While Cruz defended his wife and called Trump a "sniveling coward," telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone," the media's response to Trump's threats has been relatively subdued compared to their outrage in 2012 when Todd Akin made comments about "legitimate rape." This incident highlights the concern that Trump's behavior could have negative consequences for the Republican Party in the general election.
END OF SUMMARY.
