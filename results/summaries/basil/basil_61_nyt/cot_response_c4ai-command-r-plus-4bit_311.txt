SUMMARY:
Donald Trump stirred up controversy and alarm among Republican Party leaders this week by escalating a war of words on Twitter against Ted Cruz, his main competition in the presidential race. The conflict centers around an ad by a super PAC that featured an old nude photo shoot of Trump's wife, Melania. Despite Cruz having no affiliation with the ad and denouncing it, Trump has continued to express disbelief and threatened to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, who previously suffered from depression. Trump's actions have been deemed offensive to women and have drawn comparisons to the 2012 outrage over Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" comment. Spouses are generally seen as off-limits, yet Trump's escalation of the conflict and the media's subdued response raise concerns about the potential impact on Republican candidates in the fall. Cruz finally responded to Trump, calling him a "sniveling coward" and demanding he leave his wife alone. This incident highlights the challenges the Republican Party faces in dealing with Trump's controversial statements and actions, and the potential damage to the party's image among women voters.
END OF SUMMARY.
