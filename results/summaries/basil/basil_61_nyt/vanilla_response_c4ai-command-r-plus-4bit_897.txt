SUMMARY: This week, Donald Trump sparked new controversy in the Republican presidential primary by engaging in a war of words with Ted Cruz, his main competitor. The dispute began when a super PAC unaffiliated with Cruz released an ad featuring an old nude photo of Trump's wife, Melania, to which Trump responded by threatening to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, who had previously suffered from depression. Despite Cruz's denunciation of the ad and defense of his wife, Trump escalated the conflict by retweeting a post with unflattering photos of both women. Cruz called Trump a "sniveling coward" and told him to leave his wife alone. The media's relatively subdued response to Trump's comments has raised concerns among Republican leaders about the potential impact on female voters in the fall. The incident recalls the outrage generated by Todd Akin's comments about "legitimate rape" in 2012, and highlights the potential consequences of attacking spouses, who are generally considered off-limits in political campaigns.
END OF SUMMARY.
