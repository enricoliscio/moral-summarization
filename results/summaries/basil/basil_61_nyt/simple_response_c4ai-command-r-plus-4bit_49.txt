SUMMARY: This week, Donald Trump created controversy in the Republican presidential primary by engaging in a war of words with Ted Cruz based on an ad by a super PAC that featured an old nude photo shoot of Trump's wife, Melania. Despite Cruz having no affiliation with the ad and denouncing it, Trump continued to express disbelief and threatened to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, who had previously suffered from depression. Trump's actions have raised alarm among Republican party leaders who fear that his behavior will drive away women voters in the fall. The media outrage over Trump's comments has been relatively subdued compared to the backlash faced by Todd Akin in 2012 for his offensive remarks about "legitimate rape." Spouses are generally considered off-limits in political campaigns, and Cruz rightfully defended his wife, calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone." This incident highlights the double standard in the media's response to offensive comments and the potential damage Trump's behavior could have on the Republican Party's appeal to women voters.
END OF SUMMARY.
