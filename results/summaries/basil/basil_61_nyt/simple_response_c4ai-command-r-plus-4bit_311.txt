SUMMARY: This week, Donald Trump caused controversy by engaging in a war of words on Twitter with his Republican primary rival, Ted Cruz, using their wives as ammunition. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" on Heidi Cruz, who had previously suffered from depression, and retweeted an unflattering photo comparison of her with his wife, Melania. Cruz defended his wife, quoting the movie "The American President," but Trump continued his attacks, prompting Cruz to call him a "sniveling coward." The media outrage over Trump's comments has been relatively subdued compared to the backlash faced by Todd Akin in 2012 for his "legitimate rape" comment, raising questions about the media's treatment of spouses as off-limits in political campaigns. Trump's actions have also sparked concern among Republican leaders that his behavior will drive away women voters in the general election.
END OF SUMMARY.
