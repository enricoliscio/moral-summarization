Okay, so the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to summarize it, preserving the moral framing. The article is about Donald Trump's actions in the Republican primary, specifically targeting Ted Cruz and his wife. 

First, I need to identify the key points in the article. Trump is causing controversy by attacking Cruz, using a super PAC's ad against him. He's escalating a "war of words" on Twitter, which is a strong moral term. He's making a "comparison" between Cruz's wife and his own, which is another moral term. He's also making "threats" against Cruz's wife, which is definitely a moral issue. Cruz defended his wife, which is another moral framing word. The article also mentions that Trump's actions are similar to Todd Akin's offensive remarks, using "offensive" as a moral term.

I need to make sure the summary includes these moral words: escalated, war, comparison, threats, defended, offensive. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should structure the summary to show Trump's actions, the moral implications, and the comparison to past incidents. I'll mention how Trump's behavior is concerning party leaders because it might alienate women. Also, note that media reactions are less severe this time compared to 2012.

I need to keep the language clear and direct, ensuring all the moral terms are included without making it too verbose. Let me piece this together, making sure each point flows logically and all the key elements are covered within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has sparked controversy in the Republican primary by escalating a "war of words" on Twitter against Ted Cruz, his main competitor. Trump has repeatedly attacked Cruz over a super PAC ad featuring Melania Trump in a nude photo shoot, despite Cruz's disassociation from the ad. Trump also made "comparison" posts comparing Cruz's wife, Heidi, unfavorably to Melania, and threatened to reveal personal details about her, including her past depression. Cruz, defending his wife, called Trump a "sniveling coward" and demanded he "leave Heidi the hell alone." The article draws a moral parallel to the 2012 outrage over Todd Akin's offensive remarks about "legitimate rape," noting that while spouses are typically "off limits," the media's reaction to Trump's actions has been far less severe. Party leaders worry Trump's tactics could alienate women voters in the fall. END OF SUMMARY.
