SUMMARY: This week, Donald Trump stirred up controversy and alarm among Republican party leaders by engaging in a war of words with Ted Cruz, based on an ad by a super PAC that featured an old nude photo shoot of Trump's wife, Melania. Despite Cruz having no affiliation with the ad and denouncing it, Trump continued to express disbelief and threatened to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, who had suffered from depression. Trump's actions have been criticized as offensive and unacceptable, yet the media response has been more subdued compared to similar incidents in the past, such as the 2012 comments by Todd Akin, which led to his isolation by the Republican Party. This incident raises concerns about the moral standards of candidates and the media's role in holding them accountable. Trump's behavior, and the tepid response it has received, may drive away women voters from Republican candidates in the upcoming election.
END OF SUMMARY.
