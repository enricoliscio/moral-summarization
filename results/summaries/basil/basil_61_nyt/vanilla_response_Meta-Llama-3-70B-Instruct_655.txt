SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has sparked controversy in the Republican presidential primary by engaging in a Twitter feud with Senator Ted Cruz, his main competitor. The dispute began over an ad featuring a nude photo of Trump's wife Melania, which was created by a "super PAC" opposed to Trump's nomination. Despite Cruz's denouncement of the ad, Trump has continued to attack, even threatening to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife Heidi, who has a history of depression. Trump retweeted a side-by-side photo comparison of the two women, prompting Cruz to defend his wife and call Trump a "sniveling coward." The incident has raised concerns among party leaders that Trump's behavior will alienate women voters and harm down-ballot candidates in the fall. The media response to Trump's comments has been relatively subdued compared to the outrage sparked by Todd Akin's remarks on "legitimate rape" in 2012.

END OF SUMMARY.
