SUMMARY: This week, Donald Trump caused controversy by engaging in a war of words with Ted Cruz on Twitter, threatening to "spill the beans" about Cruz's wife, Heidi, and retweeting a post with an unflattering photo of her. Trump's actions have raised alarm among Republican Party leaders, who fear he will drive away female voters in the general election. The media outrage over Trump's comments has been relatively subdued compared to the backlash against Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" comment in 2012, which led the Republican Party to distance itself from him. Spouses are typically considered off-limits in political campaigns, but Trump has continued to escalate the situation, with Cruz finally responding by calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and telling him to leave his wife alone.
END OF SUMMARY.
