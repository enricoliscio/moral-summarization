SUMMARY:
Donald Trump stirs up *controversy* and *alarm* among Republican Party leaders as the *front-runner* in the presidential primary, engaging in a *war of words* with Ted Cruz. Trump attacks Cruz's wife, Heidi, threatening to "spill the beans" on her past bout of *depression*, despite Cruz calling Trump a "*sniveling coward*" and telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone." The media responds with *outrage*, recalling a similar incident in 2012 when Todd Akin made *offensive* comments about "legitimate rape." Spouses are generally seen as *off limits*, but the media's response to Trump's comments has been *subdued*. This incident raises concerns about the potential impact on female voters in the fall election.
END OF SUMMARY.
