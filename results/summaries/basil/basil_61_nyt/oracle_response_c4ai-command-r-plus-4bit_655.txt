SUMMARY: Donald Trump escalated a war of words against Ted Cruz this week, threatening to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, and making offensive comparisons between her and his own wife, Melania. This has stirred up alarm among Republican party leaders, who fear that Trump's actions will drive women away from the party. While Cruz has defended his wife and called Trump a "sniveling coward," the media's response to Trump's threats has been relatively subdued compared to past incidents, such as the outrage over Todd Akin's comments on "legitimate rape" in 2012.

END OF SUMMARY.
