Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in the Republican primary. Trump is causing controversy by attacking Cruz, especially targeting his wife, Heidi, who had depression. Trump used Twitter to share unflattering photos of Heidi and Melania, his own wife. Cruz called him a coward and told him to leave Heidi alone. The article compares this to the 2012 Todd Akin scandal where the media and party reacted strongly, but now the response is more muted.

I need to highlight the moral issues here. Trump's actions are crossing a line by targeting spouses, which is generally seen as off-limits. The article points out that in 2012, the party and media reacted strongly to similar issues, but now the response is less so, implying a double standard or a shift in how such behavior is handled.

So, the summary should include Trump's escalation, the targeting of spouses, the comparison to Akin, and the subdued response this time. I need to make sure the moral framing is clear, emphasizing the inappropriate behavior and the lack of strong reaction compared to past incidents.

I'll structure it to first state the controversy, then Trump's actions, the reaction from Cruz, the comparison to Akin, and the media's muted response. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure it's concise but covers all key points.

Let me draft the summary: Start with Trump causing controversy, targeting Cruz and his wife, using Twitter to share photos. Cruz condemns Trump. Then compare to Akin's case where the party reacted strongly, but now the response is less. Highlight the moral issue of targeting spouses and the double standard.

I think that covers all the necessary points while preserving the moral framing. I'll make sure the language is clear and concise, avoiding any markdown as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has sparked controversy in the Republican primary by targeting Ted Cruz and his wife, Heidi, on Twitter. Trump shared unflattering photos of Heidi Cruz, who has struggled with depression, and compared them to his wife, Melania, after a super PAC ad featuring Melania's past nude photos emerged. Cruz, who disavowed the super PAC, called Trump a "sniveling coward" and demanded he stop attacking Heidi. The article draws a parallel to the 2012 Todd Akin scandal, where Akin's offensive remarks about "legitimate rape" led to widespread condemnation and Republican distancing. However, the media and party response to Trump's actions has been far less severe, raising questions about a double standard in addressing such behavior. Trump's focus on spouses has reignited concerns about the morality of targeting personal family members in political campaigns. END OF SUMMARY.
