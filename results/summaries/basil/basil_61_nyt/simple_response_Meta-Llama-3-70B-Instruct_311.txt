SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has sparked outrage among Republican party leaders and news media critics by attacking his rival Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, on Twitter. Trump's actions are seen as a cowardly and offensive move, reminiscent of Todd Akin's infamous "legitimate rape" comment in 2012. Despite Cruz's denouncement of a "super PAC" ad featuring a nude photo of Trump's wife Melania, Trump has continued to escalate the situation, threatening to "spill the beans" on Heidi Cruz and retweeting an unflattering photo comparison of the two women. Cruz has defended his wife, calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone." The incident has raised concerns that Trump's behavior will drive away women voters from Republican candidates in the fall. The muted response from news media critics is notable, especially compared to the outrage sparked by Akin's comments. Trump's actions are widely seen as unacceptable and have sparked alarm among party leaders.

END OF SUMMARY.
