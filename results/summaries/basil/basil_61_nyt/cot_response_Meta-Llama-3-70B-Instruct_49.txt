SUMMARY:
Donald Trump sparked new controversy from his Mar-a-Lago home, alarming Republican party leaders that his actions could drive away women voters in the fall. Trump escalated a Twitter war against Ted Cruz, his main competitor, over an ad featuring a nude photo of Trump's wife Melania. Despite Cruz's denouncement of the ad, Trump continued to express disbelief and even threatened to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife Heidi, who had suffered from depression. Trump's actions were widely seen as offensive and cowardly, with Cruz finally telling Trump to "leave Heidi the hell alone." The news media's response to Trump's comments has been subdued compared to the outrage sparked by Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" remark in 2012. Trump's behavior has raised concerns that he will harm the party's chances with women voters. END OF SUMMARY.
