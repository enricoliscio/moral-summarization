Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article talks about Trump stirring up controversy in the Republican primary, specifically concerning his attacks on Ted Cruz. Trump is upset because a super PAC supporting Cruz used a nude photo of Melania Trump in an ad. Trump doesn't believe Cruz is unaffiliated with the PAC and has been attacking Cruz's wife, Heidi, who has a history of depression. He even retweeted a photo comparing Heidi and Melania, which led Cruz to call him a coward and demand he leave Heidi alone.

The author compares this to the 2012 incident with Todd Akin, where the media was more outraged, and the Republican Party distanced themselves. Here, the media's response is less intense, which is a point the author is highlighting as a moral issue—attacking spouses is off-limits, but the reaction isn't as strong this time.

So, the summary needs to include Trump's actions, the ad controversy, the comparison to Akin, and the muted media response. I should keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral aspect is clear—that attacking spouses is wrong and the media's lack of strong reaction is notable.

I'll start by mentioning Trump's actions, the ad, the comparison, and then the media's subdued response. Make sure to highlight the moral framing by noting the comparison to Akin and the implication that this issue is serious but not being handled as such.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has sparked controversy in the Republican primary by escalating a Twitter war against Ted Cruz, focusing on an ad by a super PAC critical of Trump. The ad featured a nude photo of Trump's wife, Melania, from a past photo shoot. Despite Cruz disavowing the PAC and condemning the ad, Trump accused Cruz of involvement and threatened to reveal personal details about Cruz's wife, Heidi, who has a history of depression. Trump also shared a photo comparing Heidi and Melania, leading Cruz to denounce Trump as a "sniveling coward" and demand he stop targeting Heidi. The article draws a moral comparison to the 2012 backlash against Todd Akin for his offensive remarks about rape, noting that spouses are typically off-limits in politics. However, the media's reaction to Trump's actions has been notably subdued compared to the outrage directed at Akin, highlighting a potential shift in how such controversies are handled. END OF SUMMARY.
