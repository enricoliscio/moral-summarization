Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words: escalated, war, comparison, threats, defended, offensive. I should make sure to include these in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is causing controversy in the Republican primary by attacking Cruz over a super PAC ad. The ad uses Melania's old photos, and Trump is upset, leading to a Twitter war. He made threats about Heidi Cruz's past depression and shared a photo comparison. Cruz defended his wife, calling Trump a coward. The article compares this to the 2012 Akin scandal, where the media reacted strongly, but now the response is more subdued.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's actions, using "escalated" and "war of words." I'll include the "comparison" and "threats" against Heidi Cruz. Then, I'll note Cruz's defense and the media's subdued reaction, referencing the moral framing words. I'll end by highlighting the contrast with the Akin incident.

Let me structure it step by step, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral terms are included naturally.

SUMMARY:  
From Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump escalated a war of words on Twitter against Ted Cruz, his Republican rival, over a super PAC ad featuring Melania Trump's old nude photo shoot. Despite Cruz disavowing the ad, Trump continued to express disbelief and made threats about Heidi Cruz, Ted's wife, who had battled depression. Trump also shared a side-by-side photo comparison of Heidi Cruz and Melania Trump, drawing criticism. Cruz defended his wife, calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and demanding he "leave Heidi the hell alone." The media's reaction to Trump's tactics has been far more subdued compared to the outrage in 2012 when Todd Akin made offensive remarks about rape, which led to the Republican Party isolating him. Spouses are typically seen as off-limits in political campaigns, making Trump's actions particularly controversial. END OF SUMMARY.
