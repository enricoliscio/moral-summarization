SUMMARY: Donald Trump caused controversy in the Republican presidential primary this week by escalating a feud with Ted Cruz based on an ad featuring nude photos of Trump's wife, Melania. Despite Cruz having no affiliation with the ad and denouncing it, Trump continued to express disbelief and threatened to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, who had previously suffered from depression. In response, Cruz quoted the movie "The American President" to defend his wife and called Trump a "sniveling coward," telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone." The media outrage over Trump's comments has been relatively subdued compared to similar incidents in the past, such as Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" remark in 2012, raising concerns among Republican leaders about the potential impact on female voters in the fall.
END OF SUMMARY.
