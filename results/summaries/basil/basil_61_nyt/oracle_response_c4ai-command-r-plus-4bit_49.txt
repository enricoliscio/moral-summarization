SUMMARY: This week, Donald Trump escalated a war of words against Ted Cruz, his main competition in the Republican presidential primary race. Trump's attacks on Twitter, which included threats to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, and a retweet of an offensive photo comparison of Heidi Cruz and Melania Trump, have stirred up alarm among Republican leaders. The outrage over Trump's comments has been far more subdued compared to the media outrage in 2012 when Todd Akin made offensive remarks about "legitimate rape." Spouses are generally considered off-limits in political campaigns, but Trump has repeatedly crossed this line. Ted Cruz defended his wife, quoting the movie "The American President," and called Trump a "sniveling coward," urging him to leave Heidi alone. The moral framing in the article centers around the escalation of the conflict, the offensive nature of the photo comparison, and the perceived threats and defense of spouses. END OF SUMMARY.
