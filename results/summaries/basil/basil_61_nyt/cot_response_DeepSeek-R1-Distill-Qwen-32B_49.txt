Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Donald Trump causing controversy in the Republican primary by attacking Ted Cruz, especially focusing on their wives. The article mentions a super PAC ad that uses Melania Trump's old photos, which Trump is upset about. He's been making comments about Heidi Cruz's depression and retweeting unflattering photos of her. Cruz defended his wife, calling Trump a coward. The article also draws a comparison to the 2012 Todd Akin scandal, where Akin made offensive remarks about rape, leading to a media backlash and the Republican Party distancing themselves. Now, the media's reaction to Trump's actions is less severe, which raises concerns about women's alienation in the party.

For the summary, I need to include the morally charged words like "controversy," "alarm," "war of words," "super PAC," "nude photo," "spouses," "sniveling coward," "outrage," "legitimate rape," "offensive," "media," "isolate," and "alienation." I should structure the summary to highlight how Trump's actions are causing moral concerns, especially regarding the treatment of women and the impact on the Republican party's image. I'll make sure to mention the comparison to Akin's scandal to emphasize the ongoing issue with the media's response. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key moral elements from the article.

**SUMMARY:**  
From his home at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump sparked controversy in the Republican primary, raising alarm among party leaders about alienating women. Trump escalated a war of words on Twitter against Ted Cruz, targeting Cruz's wife, Heidi, after a super PAC ad featured Melania Trump's nude photo. Despite Cruz's denouncement of the ad, Trump continued to attack, threatening to reveal personal details about Heidi Cruz, who has experienced depression. Trump also retweeted a photo comparing Heidi Cruz unfavorably to Melania Trump. Cruz defended his wife, calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and urging him to "leave Heidi the hell alone." The article draws a parallel to the 2012 Todd Akin scandal, where Akin's offensive remarks about rape led to media outrage and the Republican Party isolating him. However, the current media response to Trump's actions has been far less condemnatory, highlighting ongoing concerns about the treatment of women in politics.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
