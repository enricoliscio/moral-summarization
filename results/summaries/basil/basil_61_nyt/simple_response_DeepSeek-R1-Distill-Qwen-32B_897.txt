Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral implications.

The article talks about Trump causing controversy in the Republican primary by attacking Cruz, especially targeting their wives. Trump used Twitter to post photos comparing Cruz's wife Heidi to his own wife Melania, which seems to be a low blow. The author draws a parallel to the 2012 Todd Akin scandal, where Akin made offensive remarks about rape, leading to a strong backlash and the Republican Party distancing themselves from him. However, in Trump's case, the media's reaction is much more subdued, suggesting a double standard or a failure to hold Trump accountable in the same way.

I need to make sure the summary highlights the moral issues here. The key points are Trump's escalation of attacks on Cruz's family, the comparison to Akin's scandal, and the media's less severe reaction to Trump. This shows a discrepancy in how similar actions are treated, which is a moral issue of inconsistency and possible gender bias.

I should structure the summary to first introduce Trump's actions, then mention the comparison to Akin, and finally note the media's subdued response, emphasizing the moral framing about accountability and fairness.

Also, the summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, so I have to be clear and direct without unnecessary details. I should avoid technical jargon and keep it straightforward, focusing on the moral aspects as highlighted in the article.

Let me draft the summary step by step. Start with Trump's actions, then the comparison, then the media's reaction, and conclude with the moral implication. Make sure it's all within the word limit and flows naturally.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has reignited controversy in the Republican primary by targeting Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi Cruz, in a Twitter war. Trump posted a side-by-side photo comparison of Heidi and his wife, Melania, after Cruz criticized a super PAC ad featuring Melania's past photos. Cruz, who has no ties to the super PAC, called Trump a "sniveling coward" and demanded he stop attacking Heidi. Trump's actions have raised concerns among party leaders that his behavior could alienate women voters. The author draws a parallel to the 2012 Todd Akin scandal, where Akin's offensive remarks about rape led to widespread backlash and Republican distancing, yet Trump's behavior has not sparked the same level of media outrage, highlighting a potential double standard in how such behavior is addressed. END OF SUMMARY.
