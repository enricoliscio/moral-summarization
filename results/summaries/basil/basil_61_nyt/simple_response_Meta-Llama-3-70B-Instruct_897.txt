SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has sparked controversy and alarm among party leaders by engaging in a war of words on Twitter against Senator Ted Cruz, his main competitor. Trump's attacks targeted Cruz's wife, Heidi, including retweeting an unflattering photo comparison with his own wife, Melania. Despite Cruz's denunciation of the initial ad featuring Melania's nude photo shoot, Trump continued to make threats and insults, prompting Cruz to call him a "sniveling coward" and demand that he "leave Heidi the hell alone." The incident has drawn comparisons to the 2012 Todd Akin scandal, where the Republican Party distanced itself from Akin's offensive remarks about rape. However, the news media response to Trump's comments has been relatively subdued, despite the fact that spouses are generally considered off-limits in political attacks. Trump's behavior has raised concerns that he will drive away women voters in the fall election.

END OF SUMMARY.
