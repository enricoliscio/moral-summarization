SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has sparked controversy in the Republican presidential primary by engaging in a Twitter feud with Ted Cruz, his main competitor. The dispute began over an ad by a "super PAC" featuring a nude photo of Trump's wife Melania. Despite Cruz's denouncement of the ad, Trump continued to attack, threatening to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife Heidi, who has a history of depression. Trump retweeted a post comparing unflattering photos of the two women, prompting Cruz to defend his wife and call Trump a "sniveling coward." The incident has raised concerns among party leaders that Trump's behavior will drive away women voters in the fall. The media response has been relatively subdued compared to the outrage over Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" comments in 2012.

END OF SUMMARY.
