SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has sparked controversy in the Republican presidential primary by engaging in a Twitter feud with Senator Ted Cruz. The dispute began over an ad by a "super PAC" featuring a nude photo of Trump's wife Melania. Despite Cruz's denouncement of the ad, Trump continued to attack, threatening to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife Heidi, who has a history of depression. Trump retweeted a post comparing unflattering photos of the two women, prompting Cruz to defend his wife, calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone." The incident has raised concerns among Republican leaders that Trump's behavior will alienate women voters and harm the party's chances in the fall. The media response to Trump's comments has been relatively subdued compared to the outrage sparked by Todd Akin's remarks in 2012.

END OF SUMMARY.
