Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that Trump is causing controversy in the Republican primary, worrying party leaders that he might drive women away from supporting other candidates. He's been involved in a Twitter war with Ted Cruz over an ad by a super PAC that used a nude photo of Melania Trump. Cruz isn't involved with the super PAC and has denounced the ad, but Trump doesn't believe him.

Trump then threatens to reveal something about Heidi Cruz, Ted's wife, who had depression years ago. He retweets a photo comparing her to Melania in an unflattering way. Cruz responds by calling Trump a coward and telling him to leave Heidi alone. The article also draws a parallel to the 2012 case with Todd Akin, where the media and party reacted strongly, but this time the response is more subdued.

So, the key points are: Trump vs. Cruz on Twitter over an ad, Trump's threats against Heidi, the media's muted response, and the concern about women voters. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words.

I should structure it to include the main actors, the conflict, the specific actions taken, and the implications. Also, mention the comparison to Akin to highlight the difference in media reaction.

Let me make sure to include all these elements concisely.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has sparked controversy in the Republican primary by escalating a Twitter war with Ted Cruz over a super PAC ad featuring Melania Trump's old nude photo. Despite Cruz distancing himself from the ad, Trump accused him of involvement and threatened to reveal personal information about Cruz's wife, Heidi, who has a history of depression. Trump also shared a photo comparing Heidi and Melania unfavorably. Cruz responded by calling Trump a coward and urging him to stop targeting Heidi. The media's muted reaction contrasts with the strong backlash against Todd Akin in 2012 over offensive remarks about rape, highlighting concerns that Trump's tactics may alienate women voters. END OF SUMMARY.
