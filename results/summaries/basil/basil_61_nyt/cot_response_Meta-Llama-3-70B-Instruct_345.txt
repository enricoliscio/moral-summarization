SUMMARY:
Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has sparked controversy and alarm among party leaders with his recent Twitter attacks on Senator Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi Cruz. Trump's threatening and sniveling behavior has been widely criticized, with many calling him a coward for targeting Mrs. Cruz. The attacks, which included a side-by-side photo comparison of Mrs. Cruz and Trump's wife Melania, have been deemed offensive and unflattering. Cruz has defended his wife, quoting from the movie "The American President" and telling Trump to "leave Heidi the hell alone." The incident has drawn comparisons to the 2012 controversy surrounding Todd Akin's comments on "legitimate rape," which were also widely condemned as offensive. END OF SUMMARY.
