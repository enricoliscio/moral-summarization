SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has sparked controversy in the Republican presidential primary by engaging in a Twitter feud with Ted Cruz, his main competitor. The feud started over an ad by a "super PAC" featuring a nude photo of Trump's wife Melania. Trump has continued to attack Cruz, even threatening to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife Heidi, who has suffered from depression. Trump retweeted a side-by-side photo comparison of the two women, prompting Cruz to defend his wife and call Trump a "sniveling coward." The incident has raised concerns among party leaders that Trump's behavior will drive away women voters and harm candidates down the ballot in the fall. The media response to Trump's comments has been relatively subdued compared to the outrage sparked by Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" remark in 2012. Spouses are generally considered off-limits in political attacks, and Trump's actions have been widely criticized.

END OF SUMMARY.
