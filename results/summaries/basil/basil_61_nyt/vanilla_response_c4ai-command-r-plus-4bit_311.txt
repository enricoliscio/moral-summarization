SUMMARY: Donald Trump stirred up controversy in the Republican presidential primary this week by engaging in a war of words with Ted Cruz, his main competitor, over an ad by an anti-Trump super PAC that featured nude photos of Trump's wife, Melania. Trump threatened to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, who had previously suffered from depression, and retweeted an unflattering photo comparison of the two women. Cruz defended his wife and called Trump a "sniveling coward," telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone." The media outrage over Trump's comments has been relatively subdued compared to similar incidents in the past, such as the 2012 comments by Todd Akin, the Republican nominee for Senate in Missouri, who defended "legitimate rape." Spouses are generally considered off-limits in political campaigns, and there is concern among Republican leaders that Trump's behavior could drive away women voters in the fall.
END OF SUMMARY.
