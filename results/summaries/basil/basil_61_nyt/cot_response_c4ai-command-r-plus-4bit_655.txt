SUMMARY:
This week, Donald Trump stirred up controversy and alarm among Republican Party leaders by engaging in a war of words with Ted Cruz, his main competition in the presidential race. The dispute centers around an ad by a super PAC that featured nude photos of Trump's wife, Melania, and threats made by Trump to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, who has previously suffered from depression. While Cruz denounced the ad and called Trump a "sniveling coward," telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone," Trump has continued to express disbelief and has escalated the dispute on Twitter. The incident has raised concerns about the potential impact on Republican candidates in the fall, particularly among women voters, and the media's relatively subdued response has drawn comparisons to the outrage following Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" comments in 2012, which led to his isolation by the Republican Party. This episode underscores the perceived moral boundaries in political discourse and the potential consequences for candidates who cross them. END OF SUMMARY.
