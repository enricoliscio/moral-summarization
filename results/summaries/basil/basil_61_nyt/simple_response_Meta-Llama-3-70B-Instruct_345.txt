SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has sparked outrage in the Republican presidential primary by attacking his rival Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, on Twitter. Trump retweeted a post comparing an unflattering photo of Heidi Cruz to a glamorous photo of his own wife, Melania. This move has been widely condemned as a cowardly and offensive attack on a political opponent's spouse. The incident has raised concerns among party leaders that Trump's behavior will drive away women voters in the fall election. The media's response to Trump's comments has been surprisingly muted compared to the outcry over Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" remark in 2012. The incident highlights the importance of respecting personal boundaries and not using spouses as pawns in political battles. Trump's actions have been called out as sniveling and cowardly, and his behavior has sparked widespread alarm.

END OF SUMMARY.
