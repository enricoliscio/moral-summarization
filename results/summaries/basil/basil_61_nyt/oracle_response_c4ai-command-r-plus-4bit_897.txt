SUMMARY: From his home at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump has escalated a war of words on Twitter against Ted Cruz, his main competition in the Republican presidential primary race. The conflict began when a "super PAC" unaffiliated with Cruz released an ad featuring an old nude photo shoot of Trump's wife, Melania. Despite Cruz's denouncement of the ad, Trump continued to express disbelief and threatened to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, who had previously suffered from depression. In response, Cruz defended his wife and called Trump a "sniveling coward," telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone." This incident has stirred up alarm among Republican party leaders who fear that Trump's offensive threats and comparisons between the candidates' wives could drive away women voters in the fall. The media's subdued response to Trump's comments stands in contrast to the outrage generated by Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" comment in 2012, raising questions about the treatment of spouses as off-limits in political campaigns.
END OF SUMMARY.
