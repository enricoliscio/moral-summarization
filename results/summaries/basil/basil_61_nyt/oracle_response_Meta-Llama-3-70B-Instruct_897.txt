SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has escalated a war of words on Twitter against Senator Ted Cruz, his main competitor in the Republican presidential primary. Trump's offensive remarks targeted Cruz's wife, Heidi, after a super PAC used a nude photo of Trump's wife, Melania, in an ad. Despite Cruz's denouncement of the ad, Trump continued to make threats, including a retweeted post comparing Heidi to Melania in an unflattering way. Cruz defended his wife, calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone." The incident has sparked alarm among Republican party leaders, who fear Trump's behavior will drive away women voters in the fall. The news media's response to Trump's comments has been subdued compared to the outrage sparked by Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" remark in 2012. Spouses are generally seen as off limits, and Trump's actions have been widely criticized as offensive.

END OF SUMMARY.
