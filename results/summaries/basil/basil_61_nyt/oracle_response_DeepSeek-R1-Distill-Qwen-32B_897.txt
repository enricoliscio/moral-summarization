Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the text and specified the morally framed words to include: escalated, war, comparison, threats, defended, offensive. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is causing controversy in the Republican primary by attacking Cruz, using a super PAC ad as a starting point. He's making threats against Cruz's wife, Heidi, who had depression. He retweeted a photo comparison that's unflattering. Cruz defended his wife, calling Trump a coward. The article compares this to the 2012 Akin incident, noting media's muted response this time.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary. I'll start by mentioning Trump's actions, using "escalated" and "war of words." Then, include the "comparison" and "threats" against Heidi. Mention Cruz's defense and the moral judgment. Finally, note the media's subdued reaction, linking it to the Akin incident.

I should make sure to include all the specified moral words and keep the summary under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
Donald Trump has escalated a war of words against Ted Cruz in the Republican primary, fueling concerns that his tactics could alienate women voters. Trump has repeatedly criticized Cruz over a super PAC ad featuring Melania Trump, and has made threats against Heidi Cruz, Ted's wife, who has struggled with depression. He even retweeted a photo comparison that cast Heidi Cruz in an unflattering light. Cruz defended his wife, calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and demanding he "leave Heidi the hell alone." The situation has drawn comparisons to the 2012 backlash against Todd Akin, whose offensive remarks about "legitimate rape" damaged the GOP. However, the media's response to Trump's actions has been far more subdued, despite the clear moral implications of targeting spouses in the political arena.  
END OF SUMMARY.
