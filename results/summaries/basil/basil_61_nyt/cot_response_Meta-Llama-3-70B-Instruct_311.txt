SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's recent Twitter attacks on Senator Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, have sparked controversy and alarm among Republican party leaders. Trump's escalating war of words, including threatening to "spill the beans" on Heidi Cruz, who has suffered from depression, has been met with disbelief. The attacks have been deemed offensive, with many seeing spouses as off-limits in political battles. Trump's retweeting of an unflattering photo comparison of Heidi Cruz and Melania Trump has been called out as cowardly. Ted Cruz has finally had enough, calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone." The news media's response to Trump's comments has been subdued compared to the outrage sparked by Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" remark in 2012. Trump's actions may drive away women voters from Republican candidates in the fall. END OF SUMMARY.
