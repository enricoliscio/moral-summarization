SUMMARY: Donald Trump caused controversy in the Republican presidential primary by engaging in a war of words with Ted Cruz, his main competitor, over an ad by a super PAC featuring nude photos of Trump's wife, Melania. Despite Cruz's lack of affiliation with the super PAC and his denouncement of the ad, Trump continued to attack Cruz's wife, Heidi, who had previously suffered from depression. Cruz defended his wife and called Trump a "sniveling coward," telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone." The media outrage over Trump's comments has been relatively subdued compared to similar incidents in the past, such as Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" remark in 2012, raising concerns among Republican leaders that Trump's behavior could drive away women voters in the general election. This episode highlights the problematic nature of Trump's brand of politics, which disregards moral boundaries and targets spouses, who are generally considered off-limits. END OF SUMMARY.
