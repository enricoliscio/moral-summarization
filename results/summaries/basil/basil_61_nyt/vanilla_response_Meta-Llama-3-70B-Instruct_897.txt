SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has sparked controversy in the Republican presidential primary by engaging in a Twitter feud with Ted Cruz, his main competitor. The dispute began over an ad by a "super PAC" featuring a nude photo of Trump's wife Melania. Trump has continued to attack Cruz, even threatening to "spill the beans" on Cruz's wife Heidi, who has a history of depression. Trump retweeted a post comparing unflattering photos of the two women, prompting Cruz to defend his wife and call Trump a "sniveling coward." The incident has raised concerns among Republican leaders that Trump's behavior will drive away women voters in the general election. The media response to Trump's comments has been relatively subdued compared to the outrage over Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" remark in 2012. The incident has highlighted the general understanding that spouses are off-limits in political attacks.

END OF SUMMARY.
