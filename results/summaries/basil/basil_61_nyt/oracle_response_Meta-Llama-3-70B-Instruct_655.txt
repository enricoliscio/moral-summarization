SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has sparked new controversy in the Republican presidential primary by escalating a war of words on Twitter against Senator Ted Cruz. Trump's attacks were prompted by an ad featuring a nude photo of his wife Melania, but he has continued to threaten and offend, even after Cruz denounced the ad. Trump's threats targeted Cruz's wife Heidi, who has suffered from depression, and he retweeted a post making an unflattering comparison between the two women. Cruz defended his wife, calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and telling him to "leave Heidi the hell alone." The incident has raised alarm among party leaders, who fear Trump's offensive behavior will drive away women voters in the fall. The news media's response to Trump's comments has been subdued compared to the outrage sparked by Todd Akin's remarks in 2012, which were widely seen as offensive to women. Spouses are generally considered off-limits in political attacks, and Trump's actions have crossed a moral line.

END OF SUMMARY.
