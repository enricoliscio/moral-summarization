Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. The user provided the article, so I'll read through it carefully.

The article talks about Trump starting a controversy in the Republican primary, worrying party leaders that he might drive women away from supporting other candidates. He's been using Twitter to attack Cruz over a super PAC ad that includes Melania Trump's old photo. Cruz isn't involved with the PAC and condemned the ad, but Trump doesn't believe him.

Then, Trump threatens to reveal something about Heidi Cruz, Ted's wife, who had depression. He retweeted a comparison photo of the two women, which upset Cruz. Cruz called Trump a coward and told him to leave Heidi alone. The article draws a parallel to 2012 when Todd Akin made offensive comments about rape, leading the party to isolate him. Here, though, the media's reaction to Trump's actions is much calmer.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Trump's Twitter war with Cruz, the super PAC ad, the threats against Heidi Cruz, the media's subdued response compared to the Akin incident, and the concern about women voters.

I should make sure the summary is clear and concise, highlighting the main issues without getting too detailed. Also, I need to end with "END OF SUMMARY." and start with "SUMMARY:" as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has sparked controversy in the Republican primary by escalating a Twitter war against Ted Cruz, targeting Cruz's wife, Heidi, after a super PAC ad featuring Melania Trump's old photo emerged. Despite Cruz's denial of involvement with the PAC, Trump continued to attack, threatening to reveal personal details about Heidi Cruz and retweeting a photo comparing her to Melania. Cruz, referencing the movie "The American President," defended his wife, calling Trump a "sniveling coward" and demanding he stop targeting Heidi. The situation drew parallels to the 2012 backlash against Todd Akin, but media and party reactions to Trump's behavior have been notably less intense. END OF SUMMARY.
