Alright, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and want a summary that preserves the moral framing. The user also asked for a step-by-step process where I first identify the morally framed words and then write the summary. 

First, I'll read the article carefully to understand the context. It's about Donald Trump's behavior in the Republican primary, specifically his attacks on Ted Cruz and his wife, Heidi. The article mentions the use of a super PAC ad featuring Melania Trump, and how Trump escalated his attacks by targeting Heidi Cruz. There's a comparison to Todd Akin's controversial remarks about rape, highlighting the media's reaction then versus now.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words. These are words that carry a strong ethical or judgmental connotation. Words like "controversy," "alarm," "war of words," "attack," "offensive," "outrage," "sniveling coward," "legitimate rape," "off limits," "subdued," "morally," "condemned," and "backlash" stand out as they reflect moral judgments or implications.

Now, for the summary, I should incorporate as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise. I need to highlight the key points: Trump's actions, the comparison to Akin, the media's reaction, and the moral implications. I'll structure the summary to show how Trump's behavior is drawing comparisons to past controversies, emphasizing the moral framing.

I also need to ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally. I'll start by mentioning Trump's actions, then the comparison to Akin, the media's subdued response, and the ongoing moral debate. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to preserve the author's framing.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's accurate, concise, and maintains the moral perspective from the original article. This should meet the user's requirements effectively.

**SUMMARY:**  
Donald Trump has sparked controversy in the Republican primary by escalating a "war of words" on Twitter against Ted Cruz, targeting Cruz's wife, Heidi, after a super PAC ad featuring Melania Trump emerged. Trump's actions, including attacking Heidi Cruz's mental health history and sharing unflattering photos of her, have drawn comparisons to the 2012 Todd Akin "legitimate rape" scandal, which caused widespread outrage and led the Republican Party to isolate Akin. However, the media's response to Trump's behavior has been far more subdued. Cruz, calling Trump a "sniveling coward," demanded Trump "leave Heidi the hell alone." The situation highlights the ongoing moral debate over whether spouses should be "off limits" in political campaigns, with Trump's actions drawing criticism for their offensiveness and potential harm to women's support for the Republican Party.
