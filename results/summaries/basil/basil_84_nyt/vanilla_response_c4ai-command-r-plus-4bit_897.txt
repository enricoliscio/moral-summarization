SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, an FBI senior counterintelligence agent who played a key role in the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok gained notoriety for exchanging inflammatory text messages with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, expressing animosity towards then-candidate Donald Trump. The text messages, along with Strzok's use of personal email accounts for sensitive information and his handling of the Clinton investigation, were criticized by the inspector general. Despite Strzok's denial of allowing his political views to interfere with investigations, his dismissal removes a frequent target of President Trump's ire and provides an opportunity for the FBI to move past the controversy. Strzok's lawyer denounced the firing, stating that it contradicted the FBI's regular process and that Strzok's personal views never influenced his work. The decision to fire Strzok was made by FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich, overruling the Office of Professional Responsibility's recommendation of a suspension and demotion.
END OF SUMMARY.
