SUMMARY:
Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok, who was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation, was accused of sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump and exchanging work gossip with a former FBI lawyer, Lisa Page. The inspector general's report was critical of Strzok's conduct, citing a "biased state of mind" and a "willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate's electoral prospects." Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision, saying it was "deeply troubling" and contradicted the FBI director's testimony to Congress. Strzok's firing removes a favorite target of President Trump's ire, but raises concerns about political pressure on the FBI. Strzok expressed "significant regret" for the texts and maintained that the Russia investigation was not a "witch hunt" or a "hoax." END OF SUMMARY.
