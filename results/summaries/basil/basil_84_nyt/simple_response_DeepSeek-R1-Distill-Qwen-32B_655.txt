Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave, so I should focus on the key points that highlight the ethical issues and political implications.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main events. Strzok was fired for policy violations, including sending sensitive emails to his personal account and exchanging text messages critical of Trump. The texts showed animosity towards Trump, which Trump and his allies used to claim a witch hunt. The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's actions but didn't find evidence that his personal views affected the investigation.

I should note that Strzok was a key figure in the Russia investigation, which adds context. The firing was controversial, with his lawyer arguing it was politically motivated. The article also mentions that Strzok's dismissal removes a target for Trump and allows the FBI to move forward.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll include the reasons for his firing, the political context, the inspector general's findings, and the implications of his dismissal. I should avoid going into too much detail on each point to stay within the word limit.

Now, I'll structure the summary to first state that Strzok was fired, then outline the reasons, mention the political backdrop, the inspector general's report, and conclude with the impact of his dismissal. I'll make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like the bias in his texts and the political motivations behind the firing.

Let me draft this, making sure each sentence is clear and to the point, and that the moral framing is preserved as per the original article.

SUMMARY:  
Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending sensitive information to his personal email and exchanging inflammatory texts with Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer, during the 2016 campaign. The texts, which disparaged President Trump and expressed a desire to "stop" his presidency, were seized upon by Trump and his allies to accuse the FBI of bias and a "witch hunt." The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, citing his texts as evidence of a biased mindset and his handling of sensitive information. Strzok had testified that his political views did not influence his work, but his firing was seen as politically motivated, with his lawyer denouncing the decision as inconsistent with typical FBI practices. Strzok's dismissal removes a key target of Trump's criticism, allowing the FBI to move beyond political controversy. The inspector general also criticized Strzok for delays in handling the Clinton email investigation, though no evidence was found linking his personal views to his investigative decisions. Strzok's firing, along with that of Andrew McCabe, highlights tensions between the FBI and the Trump administration. END OF SUMMARY.
