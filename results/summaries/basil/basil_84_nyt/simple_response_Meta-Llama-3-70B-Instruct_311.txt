SUMMARY:

Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation and had exchanged inflammatory text messages with a former FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, during the 2016 campaign. The texts showed animosity towards President Trump, with Strzok responding to Page's question about Trump becoming president with "No. No he won't. We'll stop it." The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, finding no evidence that his political views affected his work, but citing the texts as indicative of a biased state of mind. Strzok's lawyer denounced the firing, saying it was a departure from typical bureau practice and contradicted the FBI director's testimony to Congress. The firing removes a favorite target of Trump's ire from the FBI ranks, but raises concerns about political pressure and the integrity of the investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
