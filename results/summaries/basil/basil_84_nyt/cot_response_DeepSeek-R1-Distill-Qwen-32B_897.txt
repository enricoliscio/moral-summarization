Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key events are Peter Strzok's firing from the FBI, his text messages with Lisa Page, the Russia investigation, and the political implications. 

Next, I have to identify all the morally framed words. Words like "disparaged," "inflammatory," "witch hunt," "illegitimate," "bias," "treasonous," "disgrace," "slow-walked," "snafus," and "unpersuasive" stand out as they carry moral judgments. I'll list these in step one.

For the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, making sure to include these moral terms. I'll start by stating Strzok's firing and the reasonsâ€”text messages and policy violations. Then, I'll mention Trump's accusations and the inspector general's report. I'll touch on the implications of the text messages and the handling of the Clinton emails. Finally, I'll note the political motivations and the impact on the FBI's credibility.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically and includes all the key moral points without going over the word limit. I'll check each sentence to make sure it's concise and retains the necessary moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
Peter Strzok, a senior F.B.I. counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory text messages critical of President Trump and mishandling sensitive information. The texts, exchanged with former F.B.I. lawyer Lisa Page, disparaged Trump and implied a willingness to take official action to influence the 2016 election. Trump and his allies accused the Russia investigation of being a politically motivated "witch hunt." The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, finding his text exchanges indicative of bias and his use of personal email accounts for sensitive information. Strzok's firing follows political pressure from Trump, who has repeatedly denounced him. His lawyer argued the dismissal was a departure from typical F.B.I. practice and contradicted assurances of following regular procedures. The report also criticized delays in handling the Clinton email investigation, raising concerns about bias in prioritizing the Russia probe. Strzok's dismissal removes a key target of Trump's accusations but raises questions about the F.B.I.'s handling of personnel matters. END OF SUMMARY.
