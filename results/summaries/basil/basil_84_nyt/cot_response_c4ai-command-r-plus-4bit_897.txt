SUMMARY:
Peter Strzok, an FBI senior counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump and exchanging sensitive information via personal email accounts. The text messages revealed a biased state of mind and a willingness to take action against Trump's electoral prospects. This decision has been criticized as troubling and a departure from typical bureau practice. Strzok's lawyer, Aitan Goelman, defended his client, stating that there was no evidence of Strzok's personal views influencing his work.

Strzok rose to become one of the FBI's most experienced counterintelligence agents, overseeing the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations. However, his conduct came under scrutiny by the inspector general, who found issues with his handling of the investigations and his text messages. The report also criticized Strzok for slow-walking the examination of new emails related to the Clinton investigation.

Trump has repeatedly denounced Strzok, accusing him of being treasonous and a disgrace, and claiming that Strzok was part of a "deep state" undermining his presidency. Strzok's dismissal removes a target of Trump's ire and provides an opportunity for the FBI to move beyond the president's criticism. Strzok expressed regret for his actions and defended the legitimacy of the Russia investigation. His dismissal follows that of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who was also fired for similar reasons. Both men lost their pension and health benefits as a result. END OF SUMMARY.
