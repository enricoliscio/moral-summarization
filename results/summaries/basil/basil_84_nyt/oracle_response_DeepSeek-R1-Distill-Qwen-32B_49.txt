Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing provided by the author. The user has specified that I should use as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article is about Peter Strzok, an FBI agent, who was fired for violating policies. He had exchanged inflammatory texts with Lisa Page, criticizing Trump, and mishandled sensitive emails. Trump and his allies used these texts to claim the Russia investigation was a witch hunt. The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's actions, leading to his dismissal. His lawyer argued the firing was unfair and politically motivated.

I need to highlight the moral aspects using words like "inflammatory," "violating," "witch hunt," "accused," "sending," etc. I'll structure the summary to include these terms, ensuring the moral framing is clear.

I'll start by mentioning Strzok's firing for violating policies, the inflammatory texts, and the accusations against him. Then, I'll note Trump's accusations of a witch hunt and the inspector general's findings. I'll include the lawyer's arguments about the decision being a departure from typical practices and politically motivated. Finally, I'll mention the impact on the FBI and the broader implications.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without going into too much detail. I'll ensure each sentence incorporates the moral framing words where appropriate.

SUMMARY:  
Peter Strzok, a senior F.B.I. counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory text messages critical of President Trump and mishandling sensitive information. The texts, exchanged with former F.B.I. lawyer Lisa Page, fueled Trump’s claims of a politically motivated “witch hunt” during the Russia investigation. Strzok was accused of prioritizing his political views over his work, and an inspector general’s report criticized his conduct, finding evidence of bias and potential interference in the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer argued the firing was a departure from standard F.B.I. practices and politically motivated, as Trump had repeatedly attacked Strzok on Twitter. The decision to fire Strzok, rather than suspend or demote him, was seen as a move to appease the president. The inspector general also criticized Strzok for slow-walking the Clinton email investigation, raising concerns about bias and bureaucratic delays. Strzok’s dismissal, along with that of Andrew McCabe, marked a significant shift in the F.B.I., with both men losing their pensions and health benefits. The case highlighted tensions between political pressures and the integrity of the F.B.I. investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
