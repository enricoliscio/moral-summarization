Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. I need to make sure I capture the key points without getting too bogged down in the details. Let me read through the article again to identify the main elements.

First, Strzok was a senior counterintelligence agent involved in the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations. He was fired for violating bureau policies, specifically sending sensitive information to his personal email and exchanging inflammatory texts with Lisa Page during the 2016 campaign. These texts criticized Trump and were used by Trump and his allies to claim a witch hunt.

The article mentions the inspector general's report, which criticized Strzok's actions, leading to his firing. It's important to note that the FBI initially recommended suspension and demotion, but the deputy director fired him instead. His lawyer argues this was a departure from standard practices and that Strzok's personal views didn't affect his work.

Also, Strzok's firing is part of a broader context where Trump and his allies accused the FBI of bias, and it's noted that another agent, Andrew McCabe, was also fired under similar circumstances. Both were fired before pension eligibility, suggesting possible political motives.

I should structure the summary to include Strzok's role, reasons for firing, the texts' impact, the inspector general's findings, the discrepancy in punishment, and the implications of his dismissal in the context of Trump's allegations. Keeping it concise and under 200 words is crucial.

I'll start by stating his position and firing reason, then mention the texts and their political impact. Next, the inspector general's report and the punishment decision. Then, the lawyer's response and the political context with McCabe. Finally, the significance of his dismissal in the broader "deep state" narrative.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically and covers all critical points without unnecessary details. Also, I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and factual.

SUMMARY:  
Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent involved in the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending sensitive information to his personal email and exchanging inflammatory texts with Lisa Page during the 2016 campaign. The texts, which criticized President Trump, were used by Trump and his allies to allege a politically motivated "witch hunt." An inspector general’s report criticized Strzok’s conduct, leading to his dismissal despite the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility initially recommending suspension and demotion. Strzok’s lawyer argued the firing was inconsistent with standard practices and that no evidence linked his personal views to his work. Strzok’s dismissal follows the firing of another senior agent, Andrew McCabe, and has been seen as politically motivated, with Trump expressing satisfaction over the decision. Strzok’s case has become emblematic of Trump’s claims of a "deep state" opposing him.  
END OF SUMMARY.
