SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, an FBI senior counterintelligence agent who played a key role in the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok had exchanged inflammatory text messages with FBI lawyer Lisa Page during the 2016 campaign, expressing animosity towards then-candidate Donald Trump. The texts, along with accusations of sending a sensitive search warrant to his personal email, led to scrutiny and criticism from the president and his allies. Despite Strzok's defense that his political views did not interfere with his work, the FBI's deputy director overruled the Office of Professional Responsibility's recommendation of a suspension and demotion, instead firing Strzok. This decision has been criticized by Strzok's lawyer as a departure from typical bureau practice and a troubling indication of political influence. The firing removes a target of Trump's ire and provides an opportunity for the FBI to move past the controversy. The incident underscores the ongoing tension between the president and the FBI, with Strzok's dismissal adding fuel to Trump's claims of a "deep state" conspiracy against him. 

END OF SUMMARY.
