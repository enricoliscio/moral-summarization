SUMMARY:
Peter Strzok, an FBI senior counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump and using his personal email account for official business. Strzok's text messages with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page showed animosity towards Trump and indicated a willingness to take action to impact the election outcome. The decision to fire Strzok has been denounced by his lawyer as a departure from typical bureau practice and troubling, as there was no evidence that Strzok's personal views influenced his work. 

Strzok became emblematic of Trump's unfounded assertions of a "deep state" of bureaucrats working against him. The President accused Strzok of being treasonous and a disgrace. However, Strzok expressed regret for his actions and rebutted claims that the Russia inquiry was politically motivated or a hoax. 

The firing comes after an inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct and the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. The report also found delays in examining new emails related to the Clinton investigation, which Strzok's lawyer justified as bureaucratic snafus. Strzok is the second senior FBI agent to be fired as a result of the inspector general's investigation, with his dismissal removing a favorite target of Trump's ire. 

END OF SUMMARY.
