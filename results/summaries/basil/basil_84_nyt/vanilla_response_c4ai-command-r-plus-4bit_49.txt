SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent who played a key role in the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok came under scrutiny for exchanging inflammatory text messages with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page during the 2016 election campaign, expressing animosity towards then-candidate Donald Trump. The text messages, along with Strzok's decision to send a sensitive search warrant to his personal email account, led to an inspector general's report that was critical of his conduct. Despite Strzok's testimony before the House that his political views did not interfere with his work, the FBI's deputy director overruled the Office of Professional Responsibility's recommendation of a suspension and demotion, instead firing Strzok. Strzok's dismissal removes a frequent target of President Trump's ire and provides an opportunity for the FBI to move beyond the president's criticism. Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision as a departure from typical bureau practice and expressed concern that it could undermine the independence of FBI agents.
