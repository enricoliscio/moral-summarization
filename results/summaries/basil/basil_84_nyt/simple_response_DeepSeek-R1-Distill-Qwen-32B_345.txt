Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. They specified that the summary should preserve the moral framing the author used. Hmm, I need to make sure I capture the key points without adding my own bias.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main events. Strzok was a senior agent involved in the Clinton and Russia investigations. He was fired for policy violations, including sending sensitive emails and his text messages with Lisa Page. Those texts were critical of Trump, which Trump and his allies used to claim a witch hunt.

I should highlight the conflict between Strzok's actions and the bureau's policies. Also, the inspector general's report found no evidence his personal views affected his work, but he was fired anyway. His lawyer is upset, saying this breaks with standard procedures.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to mention his firing, the reasons, the political implications, and the reaction from his lawyer. Make sure to include that the inspector general didn't find bias impacting his work but still criticized his conduct.

I should also note that Strzok's dismissal removes a target for Trump and the broader implications for the FBI's independence. Maybe mention that this is part of a pattern with other agents being fired under similar circumstances.

Alright, putting it all together, making sure it's clear and sticks to the moral aspects presented in the original article. Avoid any personal opinions, just the facts as they relate to the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending sensitive information to his personal email and exchanging inflammatory text messages with Lisa Page during the 2016 campaign. The texts, which disparaged President Trump, were used by Trump and his allies to claim the Russia investigation was a politically motivated "witch hunt." Strzok, a key figure in the Russia probe, had been under scrutiny since an inspector general’s report criticized his conduct, including delays in handling the Clinton email investigation and the sensitive email incident. Despite no evidence that his personal views influenced his work, Strzok’s firing was seen as politically motivated, with his lawyer denouncing the decision as inconsistent with standard FBI practices. The dismissal removes a key target of Trump’s criticism and reflects broader tensions over the FBI’s independence and impartiality. END OF SUMMARY.
