Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about Strzok being fired for violating FBI policies. He had sent inflammatory text messages about Trump and mishandled sensitive emails. Trump and his allies used these texts to criticize the Russia investigation as a witch hunt. Strzok was a key figure in the early stages of the investigation.

I should note that the firing was influenced by an inspector general's report, which criticized his conduct. The report found no evidence that his personal views affected his work, but his actions were still seen as violating policies. His lawyer argues that the firing was unusual and contradicted earlier assurances from the FBI director.

Also, the summary should mention that Strzok's firing removes a target of Trump's criticism, allowing the FBI to move beyond political pressure. The moral framing includes issues like bias, political interference, and the integrity of the FBI's processes.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the main points while highlighting the moral aspects. I'll structure it to first state the firing, the reasons, the political context, the inspector general's findings, and the implications for the FBI and Trump's claims.

SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory text messages critical of President Trump and mishandling sensitive information. The texts, exchanged with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, disparaged Trump and implied a willingness to influence the election. Despite an inspector general’s report finding no evidence that Strzok’s personal views affected his work, his conduct was deemed inappropriate. Strzok’s firing, which removes a key target of Trump’s criticism, comes amid political pressure and accusations of bias. His lawyer argued the dismissal was unusual and contradicted the FBI’s stated commitment to following proper procedures. The decision highlights tensions between political interference and the FBI’s impartiality. END OF SUMMARY.
