SUMMARY:

Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation and was accused of sending inflammatory text messages about President Trump to a former FBI lawyer, Lisa Page. The texts were seized upon by Trump and his allies to assail the Russia investigation as an illegitimate "witch hunt." Strzok was also accused of sending a highly sensitive search warrant to his personal email account. The FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility had recommended a 60-day suspension and demotion, but the deputy director of the FBI, David Bowdich, overruled the decision and fired Strzok. Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision, saying it was a departure from typical bureau practice and contradicts the FBI director's testimony to Congress.

END OF SUMMARY.
