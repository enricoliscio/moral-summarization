SUMMARY:

Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation and was accused of sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump to a former FBI lawyer, Lisa Page. The texts were seized upon by Trump and his allies to assail the Russia investigation as an illegitimate "witch hunt." Strzok was also accused of sending a highly sensitive search warrant to his personal email account. Despite an inspector general's report recommending a 60-day suspension and demotion, the FBI's deputy director overruled the recommendation and fired Strzok. Trump expressed satisfaction with the decision, which removes a favorite target of his from the FBI ranks.

END OF SUMMARY.
