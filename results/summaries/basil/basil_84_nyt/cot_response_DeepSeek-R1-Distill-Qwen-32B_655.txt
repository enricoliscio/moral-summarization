Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this user's query. They want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the query. The user provided a news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. They have two main steps: identifying morally framed single words and then writing a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Starting with Step 1, I have to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "disparaged," "inflammatory," "witch hunt," "bias," "treasonous," etc., stand out because they imply judgment or moral evaluation. I'll list each of these words, each on a new line with a *.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less. The key points are Strzok's firing, the reasons (text messages and policy violations), Trump's reaction, the inspector general's report, and the implications for the FBI and the Russia investigation. I should include the morally framed words identified earlier to maintain the author's tone.

I also need to make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the firing, moving to the context and reasons, and ending with the consequences. It's important to highlight the political implications and the conflict between the FBI's actions and Trump's accusations.

I should be careful to not add any personal opinions but stick to summarizing the facts while preserving the moral framing. That means using words like "biased," "treasonous," and "witch hunt" as they were in the original text.

Finally, I'll structure the response with the two steps clearly marked, ensuring each part is concise and meets the word limit. I'll make sure the summary is clear and captures the essence of the article, including all critical points without unnecessary details.

**STEP 1:**  
* Disparaged  
* Inflammatory  
* Witch hunt  
* Bias  
* Treasonous  
* Disgrace  
* Slow-walked  
* Misleading  
* Misconduct  
* Unpersuasive  
* Far-reaching consequences  
* Bureaucratic snafus  
* Misjudgment  
* Undermining  

**SUMMARY:**  
Peter Strzok, a senior F.B.I. counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump and handling sensitive information improperly. The texts, exchanged with former F.B.I. lawyer Lisa Page, displayed bias and animosity toward Trump, with Strzok stating they would "stop" Trump from becoming president. The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, finding his actions implied a willingness to take official action to impact Trump's electoral prospects. Strzok was also accused of forwarding a sensitive search warrant to his personal email. Trump and his allies seized on the texts to accuse the F.B.I. of a politically motivated "witch hunt." Strzok's firing followed months of political pressure and was seen as a move to remove a key target of Trump's criticism. His lawyer denounced the decision, arguing it contradicted F.B.I. director Christopher Wray's assurances of following regular processes. The dismissal came after the inspector general found no evidence that Strzok's personal views affected his work, but his actions raised concerns about bias and judgment. Strzok's firing marks a significant development in the ongoing conflict between the F.B.I. and the Trump administration.
