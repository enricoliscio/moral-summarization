SUMMARY:

Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation and was accused of sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump. The texts, exchanged with a former FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, were uncovered by the inspector general and led to Strzok's removal from the staff of special counsel Robert Mueller. The FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility recommended a 60-day suspension and demotion, but the deputy director overruled the decision and fired Strzok. Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision, saying it was a departure from typical bureau practice and contradicted the FBI director's testimony to Congress. The firing removes a favorite target of Trump's ire from the FBI ranks and gives the agency a chance to move beyond the controversy.

END OF SUMMARY.
