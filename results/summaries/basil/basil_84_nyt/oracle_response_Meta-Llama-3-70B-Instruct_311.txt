SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies, a decision that contradicts the typical practice and is deeply troubling to Americans. Strzok was accused of sending inflammatory text messages that disparaged President Trump, and was also accused of sending a highly sensitive search warrant to his personal email account. The FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility had recommended a 60-day suspension and demotion, but the deputy director overruled the decision and fired Strzok. The president has repeatedly denounced Strzok, calling him "treasonous" and a "disgrace." Strzok's lawyer argues that the decision is a departure from typical bureau practice and undermines the integrity of the FBI. The firing removes a favorite target of Trump's ire, but raises concerns about political interference in the investigation. Strzok's conduct was criticized in an inspector general's report, which found that his texts implied a willingness to take official action to impact Trump's electoral prospects. END OF SUMMARY.
