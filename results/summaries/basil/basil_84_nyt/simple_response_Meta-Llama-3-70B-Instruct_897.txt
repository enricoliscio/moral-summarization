SUMMARY:

Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation and had exchanged inflammatory text messages with a former FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, disparaging President Trump. The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, citing a "biased state of mind" and a "willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate's electoral prospects." Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision, saying it was a departure from typical bureau practice and contradicted the FBI director's testimony to Congress. The firing removes a favorite target of President Trump from the FBI ranks, allowing the agency to move beyond the president's ire. The decision is "deeply troubling" and raises concerns about political pressure on the FBI.

END OF SUMMARY.
