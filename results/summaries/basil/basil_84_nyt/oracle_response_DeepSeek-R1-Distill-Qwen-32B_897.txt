Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Peter Strzok was fired from the FBI for violating policies, specifically sending inflammatory texts about Trump and mishandling sensitive emails. The author uses words like "inflammatory," "violating," and "witch hunt," which are morally charged. I should make sure to include these terms in the summary.

I notice that the article mentions how Trump and his allies used the texts to criticize the Russia investigation as a witch hunt. It's important to highlight that because it shows the political implications. Also, the inspector general's report criticized Strzok's actions, leading to his firing instead of a demotion, which the lawyer called a departure from typical practices.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. I'll structure it by mentioning Strzok's firing, the reasons (inflammatory texts and policy violations), the political context, the inspector general's findings, and the implications for the FBI and Trump's narrative. I'll ensure that each key moral term is included where appropriate without making the summary too lengthy.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." to meet the user's formatting requirements.

SUMMARY:  
Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory text messages critical of President Trump and mishandling sensitive information. The texts, exchanged with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, expressed animosity toward Trump and were seized upon by Trump and his allies to accuse the Russia investigation of being a politically motivated "witch hunt." Strzok, a key figure in the early stages of the Russia inquiry, was also accused of forwarding a sensitive search warrant to his personal email. The FBI faced political pressure from Trump to remove Strzok, who had been reassigned from Mueller's team in 2017. An inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, including his slow handling of the Clinton email investigation, and recommended suspension and demotion. However, the FBI deputy director overruled this and fired Strzok, a decision denounced by his lawyer as a departure from standard practices. Strzok's firing removes a target of Trump's accusations, but his lawyer argued no evidence linked his personal views to his work. The dismissal highlights tensions between political interference and professional integrity in the FBI. END OF SUMMARY.
