Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, and I have to make sure they're included. The summary needs to be under 200 words and should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Peter Strzok was fired from the FBI for violating policies, specifically sending inflammatory texts and sensitive emails. He was involved in the Clinton and Russia investigations. Trump and his allies used the texts to criticize the Russia probe as a witch hunt. The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, including the texts and his handling of emails. His firing was controversial, with his lawyer arguing it was politically motivated. The report also looked into delays in the Clinton investigation. Strzok denied leaking info and maintained his work wasn't biased. His dismissal is part of a larger narrative about the "deep state" opposing Trump.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary, using as many of the provided moral words as possible. I should ensure the summary flows well and covers all key points without exceeding 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Strzok's firing, his violations, the texts, and Trump's reaction. Then, I'll touch on the inspector general's report, the sensitive emails, and the delays in the investigation. Finally, I'll note the political implications and the impact on the FBI.

I'll make sure to include words like "inflammatory," "violating," "witch hunt," "accused," "sending," "investigation," "interfere," "impact," "use," "served," "leaked," "motivated," "bias," "disgrace," "hoax," "contradicts," etc. I need to weave these into the summary naturally.

Let me structure it step by step: 

1. Strzok's firing and the reasons.
2. The texts and their impact.
3. Inspector general's findings.
4. The sensitive emails and delays.
5. The political context and implications.

I'll check each sentence to see if I can incorporate the moral words without making it forced. For example, instead of saying "criticized," I can use "accused" or "criticized" as per the list.

Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping an eye on the word count and ensuring all key points are covered with the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory texts critical of President Trump and handling sensitive information via personal email. Trump and his allies used the texts to accuse the Russia investigation of being a politically motivated "witch hunt." The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, finding his texts demonstrated bias and implied a willingness to impact Trump's electoral prospects. Strzok was also accused of slow-walking an investigation related to Hillary Clinton's emails, raising concerns about bias. His lawyer argued the firing was politically motivated, contradicting FBI assurances of following regular processes. Strzok's dismissal removes a key target of Trump's allegations of a "deep state" conspiracy, though critics argue it undermines the bureau's integrity. The decision leaves questions about the FBI's handling of politically charged investigations. END OF SUMMARY.
