SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump and exchanging work gossip. The texts were used by Trump and his allies to assail the Russia investigation as an illegitimate "witch hunt". The FBI had been under immense political pressure from Trump to dismiss Strzok, who was removed from the special counsel's staff last summer. Strzok's text exchanges with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page demonstrated animosity toward Trump and implied a willingness to take action to impact the election. The inspector general criticized Strzok's conduct, including sending sensitive information to his personal email account and not acting swiftly on new emails related to the Clinton investigation. Strzok's dismissal removes a favorite target of Trump and gives the FBI a chance to move beyond the president's ire. However, Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision as a departure from typical bureau practice and troubling, arguing that Strzok's personal views did not affect his work. Strzok's firing is the second senior FBI agent to be dismissed as a result of the inspector general's investigation, with both men losing their pensions and benefits.
END OF SUMMARY.
