SUMMARY:

Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation and was accused of sending inflammatory text messages about President Trump to a former FBI lawyer, Lisa Page. The texts were uncovered by the inspector general, who found no evidence that Strzok's political views affected his work, but criticized his conduct. Strzok was also accused of sending a sensitive search warrant to his personal email account. The FBI deputy director overruled the Office of Professional Responsibility's recommendation to suspend Strzok for 60 days and demote him, instead choosing to fire him. Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision, saying it was a departure from typical bureau practice and contradicts the FBI director's testimony to Congress.

END OF SUMMARY.
