SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent who played a key role in the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok had exchanged inflammatory text messages with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page during the 2016 campaign, expressing animosity towards then-candidate Donald Trump. The text messages, along with accusations of sending a sensitive search warrant to his personal email account, led to an investigation by the inspector general. Despite Strzok's testimony that his political views did not interfere with his work, the FBI's deputy director overruled the Office of Professional Responsibility's recommendation of a suspension and demotion, instead firing Strzok. Strzok's lawyer denounced the dismissal as a departure from typical bureau practice and a decision that should trouble all Americans. The firing removes a target of President Trump's ire and provides an opportunity for the FBI to move beyond the president's criticism. The inspector general's report also criticized Strzok's handling of new emails related to the Clinton investigation and his forwarding of a proposed search warrant to his personal email. Strzok's dismissal follows that of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who was also fired for violating bureau policies.
END OF SUMMARY.
