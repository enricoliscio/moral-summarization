Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. Let me read through the article to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Peter Strzok was fired for violating FBI policies. He was a senior counterintelligence agent involved in the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations. His text messages with Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer, were inflammatory and critical of Trump, which Trump and his allies used to attack the Russia investigation as a witch hunt.

Strzok sent a sensitive search warrant to his personal email, which is another violation. The FBI faced political pressure from Trump to remove him, and he was taken off Mueller's team last summer. Trump has been criticizing Strzok on Twitter and was happy about his firing.

The inspector general's report in June criticized Strzok's conduct, including the texts and using personal email. The Office of Professional Responsibility wanted him suspended and demoted, but the deputy director fired him instead. Strzok's lawyer says this departure from normal procedure is troubling and that there's no evidence his personal views affected his work.

The text messages showed Strzok and Page were hostile towards Trump. The inspector general found no evidence they let their bias affect their work but noted the texts indicated a biased mindset. The report also criticized delays in the Clinton investigation, suggesting Strzok might have prioritized the Russia case over the Clinton emails.

Strzok was reassigned to human resources after Mueller took over. Lisa Page left the FBI in May. The article mentions that Strzok's firing is part of a pattern, with another agent, Andrew McCabe, also being fired under similar circumstances, both before they could get pensions.

So, the summary should include: Strzok's firing, reasons (violations, texts, personal email), political pressure from Trump, the inspector general's report, the nature of the texts, the impact on investigations, and the implications for the FBI and Trump's claims about a deep state.

I need to condense all this into under 200 words, focusing on the main points without too much detail. Make sure to mention the key events and the significance of the firing in the context of Trump's accusations and the internal FBI processes.

SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending sensitive information to his personal email and exchanging inflammatory texts with Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer, during the 2016 campaign. The texts criticized President Trump, leading Trump and his allies to accuse the Russia investigation of being a "witch hunt." The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, including the texts and delays in the Clinton email investigation. Despite no evidence linking his personal views to his work, Strzok's firing followed political pressure from Trump, who has repeatedly attacked him. His dismissal removes a key target of Trump's accusations but raises concerns about the FBI's internal processes and potential political motivations. Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision, calling it a departure from typical bureau practices. END OF SUMMARY.
