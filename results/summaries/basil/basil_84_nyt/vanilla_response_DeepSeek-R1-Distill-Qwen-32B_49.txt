Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. Let me read through the article to understand the key points.

So, Peter Strzok was a senior counterintelligence agent at the FBI. He was involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Russia probe during the 2016 campaign. He was fired for violating bureau policies. His lawyer mentioned that the firing was unexpected because the Office of Professional Responsibility had recommended a suspension and demotion instead.

The main issues were his text messages with Lisa Page, another FBI lawyer, where they had negative comments about Trump. These texts were used by Trump and his allies to criticize the Russia investigation as a witch hunt. Also, Strzok sent a sensitive search warrant to his personal email, which is a violation.

The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, including the texts and the personal email use. It also mentioned delays in handling the Clinton investigation, which some saw as biased. However, Strzok's lawyer argued that there was no evidence his personal views affected his work.

Strzok's firing is part of the political tension between him and Trump, who has been critical of him. The FBI director and deputy director decided to fire him instead of following the initial disciplinary action. This move might help the FBI move past the political conflict with Trump.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting Strzok's firing, the reasons (text messages and personal email), the political context, and the impact on the FBI. I should also mention the inspector general's report and the lawyer's response.

SUMMARY:  
Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending sensitive information to his personal email and exchanging inflammatory texts with Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer, during the 2016 campaign. The texts, which criticized President Trump, were used by Trump and his allies to accuse the Russia investigation of being a "witch hunt." Strzok, a key figure in the Russia probe, had been under scrutiny since an inspector general's report criticized his conduct. The report found no evidence his personal views influenced his work but noted his texts implied bias. Strzok's lawyer argued his firing was politically motivated, as the FBI had initially recommended suspension and demotion. Strzok's dismissal follows political pressure from Trump, who has repeatedly criticized him. The firing removes a key target of Trump's accusations but raises concerns about impartiality in the FBI. END OF SUMMARY.
