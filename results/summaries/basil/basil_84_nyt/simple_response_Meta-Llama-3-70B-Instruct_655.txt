SUMMARY:

Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation and was accused of sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump. The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, and the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility recommended a 60-day suspension and demotion. However, the deputy director of the FBI overruled the recommendation and fired Strzok. Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision, saying it was a departure from typical bureau practice and contradicted the FBI director's testimony to Congress. The firing removes a favorite target of President Trump's ire from the FBI ranks, but raises concerns about political pressure and the integrity of the investigation. Strzok's dismissal follows that of Andrew G. McCabe, another senior FBI agent, who was also fired as a result of the inspector general's investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
