SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok, who helped oversee the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations, had exchanged inflammatory text messages with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page during the 2016 campaign, expressing animosity towards then-candidate Donald Trump. Strzok was also accused of sending a sensitive search warrant to his personal email account. 

The decision to fire Strzok was made by FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich, overruling the Office of Professional Responsibility's recommendation of a 60-day suspension and demotion. Strzok's dismissal removes a target of repeated attacks by President Trump, who has called Strzok "treasonous" and a "disgrace." However, Strzok's lawyer, Aitan Goelman, denounced the firing, stating that it contradicts FBI Director Christopher Wray's assurances to Congress and that there was no evidence that Strzok's personal views impacted his work. 

The Inspector General's report, which preceded Strzok's firing, criticized his conduct in sending the text messages and using personal email accounts for sensitive information. It also questioned Strzok's decision-making in the Clinton investigation, suggesting potential bias. Strzok expressed regret for the texts during a congressional hearing and rebutted Trump's attacks on the Russia inquiry, stating that it was not politically motivated or a hoax. 

Strzok's dismissal follows that of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was also fired for violating bureau policies. Both men were fired before becoming eligible for their pension and health benefits.
END OF SUMMARY.
