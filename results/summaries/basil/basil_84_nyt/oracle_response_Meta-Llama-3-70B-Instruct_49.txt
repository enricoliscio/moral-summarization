SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies, a decision that removes a favorite target of President Trump from the FBI ranks. Strzok was accused of sending inflammatory text messages disparaging Trump during the 2016 campaign, which Trump and his allies seized upon to assail the Russia investigation as an illegitimate "witch hunt." The FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility had recommended a 60-day suspension and demotion, but the deputy director overruled the decision, citing Strzok's conduct as a departure from typical bureau practice. Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision, saying it contradicts the FBI director's testimony to Congress and is deeply troubling to all Americans. The inspector general's report had criticized Strzok's use of personal email accounts to handle sensitive information and his decision not to move swiftly to examine new emails related to the Clinton investigation. Strzok's firing is seen as a victory for Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Strzok as "treasonous" and a "disgrace." END OF SUMMARY.
