Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by stating that Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies. He was involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Russia probe. His text messages with Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer, were inflammatory and critical of Trump, which Trump and his allies used to argue that the Russia investigation was a witch hunt.

Strzok was also accused of sending a sensitive search warrant to his personal email, which is a policy violation. The FBI faced political pressure from Trump to remove him. The inspector general's report criticized his conduct, leading to his suspension and demotion, but instead, he was fired. His lawyer, Aitan Goelman, argued that this decision was unusual and contradicted the director's assurances.

The text messages showed Strzok and Page's animosity towards Trump, which the inspector general found concerning, implying bias. The report also criticized delays in the Clinton email investigation, suggesting possible bias in prioritizing the Russia probe. Strzok denied leaking information and claimed his work wasn't affected by his personal views.

Strzok's firing was part of the inspector general's findings, making him the second senior agent fired. Both he and Andrew McCabe were fired before their pension eligibility, suggesting possible political motivations. Strzok had a long career in the FBI, handling significant espionage cases.

So, the summary needs to capture these key points: Strzok's firing, the reasons (text messages and policy violations), political pressure from Trump, the inspector general's report, the implications of his actions, and the broader context of the Russia investigation and political dynamics.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the main events and implications without getting too detailed. I should structure it to first state the firing, then the reasons, political context, inspector general's findings, and the significance of his dismissal.

SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending sensitive information to his personal email and exchanging inflammatory text messages with Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer, during the 2016 campaign. These messages, which criticized President Trump and implied bias, were used by Trump and his allies to argue that the Russia investigation was a witch hunt. The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, leading to his suspension and demotion, but he was ultimately fired. His lawyer argued the decision was unusual and politically motivated. Strzok had denied allowing personal views to influence his work and expressed regret for the texts. His firing, part of the inspector general's findings, follows the dismissal of another senior agent, Andrew McCabe, under similar circumstances, raising concerns about political interference. END OF SUMMARY.
