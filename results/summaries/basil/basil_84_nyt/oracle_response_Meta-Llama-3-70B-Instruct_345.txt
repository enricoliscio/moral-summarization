SUMMARY:

Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies, his lawyer said Monday. Strzok was accused of sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump and was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation. The FBI had been under immense political pressure from Mr. Trump to dismiss Strzok, who was removed last summer from the staff of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. The president has repeatedly denounced Strzok in posts on Twitter, and on Monday expressed satisfaction that he had been sacked. Strzok's conduct was criticized in a wide-ranging inspector general's report, which found that he had sent a highly sensitive search warrant to his personal email account and had slow-walked the examination of new emails related to the Clinton investigation. Strzok's lawyer denounced his client's dismissal, saying it was a "departure from typical bureau practice" and "contradicts" the FBI director's testimony to Congress. The decision is "deeply troubling" and removes a favorite target of Mr. Trump from the ranks of the FBI.
