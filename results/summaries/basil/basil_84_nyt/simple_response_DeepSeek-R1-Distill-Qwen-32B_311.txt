Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points.

So, Strzok was a senior FBI agent involved in the Clinton and Russia investigations. He sent inflammatory texts about Trump, which Trump and his allies used to criticize the Russia probe as a witch hunt. The inspector general's report found issues with his conduct, like sending sensitive info to his personal email and delaying an investigation related to Clinton. The FBI fired him, which aligns with Trump's efforts to remove him. His lawyer claims the firing was political and against standard procedures.

I need to highlight the moral issues here: Strzok's bias affecting his work, the political pressure from Trump, and the potential impact on the investigation's integrity. Also, note that the firing might be seen as politically motivated, affecting public trust in the FBI.

I should structure the summary to include these points concisely, making sure to capture the moral implications without getting too bogged down in details. Keep it under 200 words, starting with the key events and then the consequences and reactions.

Wait, the user mentioned to include the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens. I should make sure to format it correctly, keeping each sentence clear and to the point. Also, ensure that the moral framing is evident, like the conflict between political bias and professional duty.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and captures all the essential moral aspects.

SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory texts about President Trump and handling sensitive information in his personal email. Strzok's texts, exchanged with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, criticized Trump and expressed a desire to stop his presidency, leading Trump and his allies to accuse the FBI of bias. The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, finding no evidence his personal views affected investigations but noting his texts implied bias. Strzok's firing followed political pressure from Trump, who repeatedly attacked him on Twitter. His lawyer denounced the decision as politically motivated, arguing it contradicted FBI director Christopher Wray's assurances of following standard procedures. The firing removes a key target of Trump's criticism but raises concerns about the FBI's impartiality and the impact of political influence on its operations. Strzok's dismissal also highlights the broader debate over the "deep state" and the integrity of the Russia investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
