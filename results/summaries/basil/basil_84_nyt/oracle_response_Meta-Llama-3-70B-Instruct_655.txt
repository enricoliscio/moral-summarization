SUMMARY:

Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory text messages that disparaged President Trump. The decision to fire Strzok, who was accused of imposing his political views on the Russia investigation, contradicts the FBI's typical practice and is a departure from the bureau's regular process. Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision, stating that it is "deeply troubling" and that there is no evidence that Strzok's personal views ever affected his work. The inspector general's report, which preceded Strzok's firing, criticized his conduct in sending the texts and using personal email accounts to handle sensitive information. Strzok's dismissal is seen as a victory for President Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Strzok and the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt." Strzok's firing removes a favorite target of Trump's ire from the FBI ranks, giving the bureau a chance to move beyond the president's unfounded assertions.

END OF SUMMARY.
