SUMMARY:

Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies, his lawyer said. Strzok was accused of sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump during the 2016 campaign, and was also accused of sending a highly sensitive search warrant to his personal email account. The FBI had been under immense political pressure from Trump to dismiss Strzok, who was removed from the staff of special counsel Robert Mueller last summer. Trump expressed satisfaction that Strzok had been sacked, calling him "treasonous" and a "disgrace." Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision, saying it was a departure from typical bureau practice and contradicted the FBI director's testimony to Congress. The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, finding that his personal views had impacted his work. Strzok's firing removes a favorite target of Trump's ire from the FBI ranks, giving the agency a chance to move beyond the controversy.

END OF SUMMARY.
