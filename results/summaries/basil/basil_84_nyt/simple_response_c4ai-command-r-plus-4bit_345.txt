SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, an FBI senior counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump and sending a sensitive search warrant to his personal email account. Strzok played a key role in the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations, and his text messages with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page showed a clear bias against Trump. The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct and found that his political views may have influenced his investigative decisions. Strzok's dismissal removes a target of Trump's ire and gives the FBI a chance to move beyond the president's criticism. However, Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision, stating that there was no evidence that Strzok's personal views affected his work. The firing of Strzok, who had a distinguished career in the FBI, highlights the ethical dilemmas and political pressures facing the bureau.
END OF SUMMARY.
