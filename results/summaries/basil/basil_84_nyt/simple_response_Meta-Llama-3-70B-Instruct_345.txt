SUMMARY:

Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation and had exchanged inflammatory text messages with a former FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, disparaging President Trump. The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, finding no evidence that his political views affected his work, but citing a willingness to take official action to impact Trump's electoral prospects. Strzok's lawyer denounced the firing, saying it contradicts the FBI director's testimony to Congress and assures that the FBI intended to follow its regular process. The firing removes a favorite target of Trump's ire and gives the FBI a chance to move beyond the president's criticism. Strzok's dismissal is seen as a victory for Trump, who has repeatedly attacked the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."

END OF SUMMARY.
