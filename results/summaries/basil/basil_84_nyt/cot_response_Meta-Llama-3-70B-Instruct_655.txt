SUMMARY:
Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation and was accused of sending inflammatory text messages that showed a biased state of mind. The inspector general's report was critical of Strzok's conduct, citing a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate's electoral prospects. Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision, calling it a departure from typical bureau practice and contradicting the FBI director's testimony to Congress. The firing removes a favorite target of President Trump's ire, but raises concerns about the politicization of the FBI. Strzok's dismissal is deeply troubling and has far-reaching consequences. END OF SUMMARY.
