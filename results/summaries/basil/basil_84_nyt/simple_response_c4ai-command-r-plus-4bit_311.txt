SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump and sending a sensitive search warrant to his personal email account. Strzok had been a key figure in the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations, and his text messages with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page showed animosity toward Trump and implied a willingness to take action to impact the election. The FBI was under political pressure by Trump to dismiss Strzok, and his firing removes a favorite target of Trump's ire. Strzok's lawyer denounced the dismissal, stating that there was no evidence that Strzok's personal views affected his work. However, the inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct and use of personal email accounts, as well as his decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on new emails related to the Clinton investigation. The firing of Strzok, who had become emblematic of Trump's unfounded "deep state" assertions, gives the FBI a chance to move beyond the president's ire.
