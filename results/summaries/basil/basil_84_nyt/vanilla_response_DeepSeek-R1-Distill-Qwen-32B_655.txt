Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Peter Strzok being fired from the FBI. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

The article mentions that Peter Strzok was a senior counterintelligence agent who sent inflammatory texts about President Trump. These texts were exchanged with Lisa Page, another FBI lawyer. The texts showed animosity towards Trump, with Strzok saying they would stop Trump from becoming president. This was during the 2016 campaign, and Trump and his allies used these texts to criticize the Russia investigation as a witch hunt.

Strzok was also accused of sending a sensitive search warrant to his personal email, which violates FBI policies. The inspector general's report criticized his conduct, leading to his suspension and demotion recommendation. However, instead of being demoted, he was fired. His lawyer, Aitan Goelman, argues that this decision was unusual and contradicts the FBI director's assurances about following regular processes.

The article also mentions that Strzok was a key figure in the early stages of the Russia investigation and was later removed from Mueller's team. His firing is seen as a move by the FBI to distance itself from Trump's criticism, especially since Trump has been vocal about wanting Strzok out.

Additionally, the inspector general's report criticized Strzok for delays in handling new emails related to the Clinton investigation, suggesting potential bias. Strzok's lawyer defends him, stating that his personal views didn't affect his work, and that the dismissal is politically motivated.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: Strzok's firing, the reasons (texts and policy violations), the political implications, and the inspector general's findings. I should also mention his role in the investigations and the reaction from his lawyer.

Let me structure this: Start with his firing, mention the text messages and policy violations, the political context, the inspector general's report, and the outcome. Keep it concise, making sure each sentence covers a key point without going into too much detail.

I should avoid including too many specific details, like the exact number of texts or the specifics of the Clinton emails, unless they're essential. The focus should be on the main events and their implications.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and covers all the essential points.
