SUMMARY:
Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation and had exchanged inflammatory text messages with a former FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, during the 2016 campaign. The texts demonstrated animosity towards President Trump, with Strzok responding to Page's question about Trump becoming president with "No. No he won't. We'll stop it." The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, citing a "biased state of mind" and a "willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate's electoral prospects." Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision, calling it a "departure from typical bureau practice" and "deeply troubling to all Americans." The firing removes a favorite target of President Trump's ire from the FBI ranks. END OF SUMMARY.
