SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump and Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election campaign. Mr. Strzok was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation and helped oversee the Hillary Clinton email investigation. The decision to fire Mr. Strzok has been criticized by his lawyer, who stated that it contradicts the FBI's regular process and should be deeply troubling to all Americans. The text messages exchanged with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page demonstrated animosity toward Mr. Trump and implied a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate's electoral prospects. The inspector general's report also criticized Mr. Strzok's use of personal email accounts to handle sensitive information and his decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on new emails related to the Clinton investigation. Mr. Strzok's dismissal removes a favorite target of Mr. Trump's ire and gives the FBI a chance to move beyond the president's criticism. However, Mr. Strzok's lawyer defended his client, stating that his personal views never affected his work.
END OF SUMMARY.
