SUMMARY:

Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation and was accused of sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump. The texts, exchanged with a former FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, were seized upon by Trump and his allies to assail the Russia investigation as an illegitimate "witch hunt." Strzok's lawyer denounced the dismissal, saying it was a departure from typical bureau practice and contradicts the FBI director's testimony to Congress. The inspector general's report had criticized Strzok's conduct in sending the texts and his use of personal email accounts to handle sensitive information. Strzok's firing removes a favorite target of Trump's ire from the FBI ranks.

END OF SUMMARY.
