SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent who played a key role in the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok exchanged inflammatory text messages with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page during the 2016 campaign, expressing animosity towards then-candidate Donald Trump. The text messages, along with Strzok's decision to send a sensitive search warrant to his personal email account, led to his dismissal. 

Strzok's text messages and involvement in the Clinton email investigation drew intense criticism from President Trump, who labeled the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt." An inspector general's report also criticized Strzok's conduct and recommended disciplinary action. Despite Strzok's denial of allowing his political views to influence his work, the FBI's deputy director overruled the Office of Professional Responsibility and fired Strzok. 

Strzok's dismissal removes a target of Trump's ire and provides an opportunity for the FBI to move beyond the president's criticism. Strzok expressed sadness over the decision, while his lawyer denounced it as a departure from typical bureau practice and troubling for all Americans. The firing concludes a controversial chapter in the FBI's recent history, with Strzok becoming emblematic of Trump's assertions of a "deep state" conspiracy against his presidency.
END OF SUMMARY.
