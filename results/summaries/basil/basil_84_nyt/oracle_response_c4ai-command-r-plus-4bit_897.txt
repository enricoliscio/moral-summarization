SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies and sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump during the 2016 election campaign. The text messages, exchanged with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, were used by Trump and his allies to discredit the Russia investigation as an illegitimate "witch hunt." Strzok played a key role in the early months of the investigation and had also overseen the Hillary Clinton email probe. The FBI's deputy director, David Bowdich, overruled the Office of Professional Responsibility's recommendation of a suspension and demotion, instead firing Strzok. This decision has been criticized by Strzok's lawyer, who stated that there was no evidence that Strzok's personal views affected his work. The text messages, however, implied a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate's electoral prospects. Strzok's dismissal removes a target of Trump's ire and may help the FBI move beyond the president's criticism. The firing of Strzok, a 20-year FBI veteran, is a departure from typical bureau practice and contradicts assurances by FBI director Christopher Wray to follow regular process. Strzok expressed regret for the texts and denied that the investigation was politically motivated.
END OF SUMMARY.
