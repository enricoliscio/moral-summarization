SUMMARY:
Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation and was accused of sending inflammatory text messages that disparaged President Trump. The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, saying it was "not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate's electoral prospects." Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision, saying it was "deeply troubling" and contradicted the FBI director's testimony to Congress. Strzok's firing removes a favorite target of Trump's ire from the FBI ranks. Trump has repeatedly denounced Strzok, calling him "treasonous" and a "disgrace." Strzok expressed "significant regret" for the texts and maintained that the Russia investigation was not a "witch hunt" or a "hoax."
END OF SUMMARY.
