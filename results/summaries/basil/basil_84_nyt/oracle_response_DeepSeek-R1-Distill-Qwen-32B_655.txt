Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words that should be included. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Peter Strzok was fired from the FBI for violating policies, including sending inflammatory texts and mishandling sensitive emails. He was a key figure in the Russia investigation, which Trump and his allies criticized as a witch hunt. The inspector general's report found issues with his conduct, leading to his dismissal. His lawyer argued that the firing was a departure from typical practices and that there was no evidence his personal views affected his work. The summary should highlight the moral aspects like violating policies, inflammatory texts, witch hunt, and the impact on the investigation.

I'll structure the summary to include the key events: Strzok's firing, the reasons (inflammatory texts, sending sensitive info), the political pressure from Trump, the inspector general's findings, and the implications for the FBI and the Russia investigation. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words provided, such as "inflammatory," "violating," "witch hunt," "accused," "sending," "investigation," etc.

I'll start by stating Strzok's firing, then mention the reasons, followed by the political context, the inspector general's report, and conclude with the impact on the FBI and the investigation. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes as many of the moral terms as possible without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary.

SUMMARY:  
Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory text messages critical of President Trump and mishandling sensitive information. The texts, exchanged with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page during the 2016 campaign, disparaged Trump and implied a willingness to impact his electoral prospects, fueling Trump and his allies' claims of a politically motivated "witch hunt." Strzok was also accused of forwarding a sensitive search warrant to his personal email. The FBI faced political pressure from Trump to remove Strzok, who had been reassigned after the special counsel, Robert Mueller, took over the Russia investigation. An inspector general’s report criticized Strzok’s conduct, leading to his dismissal despite assurances from FBI Director Christopher Wray that regular processes would be followed. Strzok’s lawyer denounced the firing as a departure from typical bureau practice, arguing no evidence showed his personal views affected his work. The decision removes a key figure from the FBI and may help the agency move beyond Trump’s ire. Strzok’s firing underscores tensions between political pressures and investigative integrity, with implications for the Russia inquiry and the broader perception of the FBI’s impartiality. END OF SUMMARY.
