Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two steps: first, identifying all the single words that are morally framed, and then writing a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "disparaged," "inflammatory," "witch hunt," "violating," "illegitimate," "bias," "treasonous," "disgrace," "slow-walked," "unpersuasive," "far-reaching," "bureaucratic snafus," "misleading," "discredit," "unjustified," "betrayal," and "dishonesty" stand out as they imply moral judgment or wrongdoing.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into about 200 words, making sure to include these moral terms. I'll structure it by highlighting Strzok's actions, the consequences, and the political implications, using the identified words to maintain the moral framing. I'll ensure the summary flows logically, covering his firing, the text messages, the inspector general's report, and the broader context of political pressure and the "deep state" narrative.

**SUMMARY:**
Peter Strzok, a senior F.B.I. counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump and mishandling sensitive information. The texts, exchanged with former F.B.I. lawyer Lisa Page, were used by Trump and his allies to allege a politically motivated "witch hunt" during the Russia investigation. Strzok, a key figure in the early stages of the inquiry, was accused of bias and slow-walking the Clinton email investigation. An inspector general's report criticized his conduct, leading to his dismissal. Strzok's lawyer argued the firing was politically motivated, contradicting F.B.I. director Christopher Wray's assurances of following standard procedures. The decision has been described as "deeply troubling," with no evidence linking Strzok's personal views to his work. Strzok's firing removes a target of Trump's accusations, though critics argue it undermines the bureau's integrity. The case highlights tensions between political pressure and professional accountability within the F.B.I. END OF SUMMARY.
