SUMMARY:

Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation and had exchanged inflammatory text messages with a former FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, disparaging President Trump. The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct, citing a "biased state of mind" and a willingness to take official action to impact Trump's electoral prospects. Strzok's lawyer denounced the firing, saying it was a departure from typical bureau practice and contradicted the FBI director's testimony to Congress. The firing removes a favorite target of Trump's ire from the FBI ranks, but raises concerns about political pressure and the integrity of the investigation. Strzok's dismissal is a troubling development that undermines the independence and impartiality of law enforcement agencies.

END OF SUMMARY.
