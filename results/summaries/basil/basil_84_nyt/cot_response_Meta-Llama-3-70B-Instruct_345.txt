SUMMARY:
Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies. Strzok was accused of sending inflammatory text messages that disparaged President Trump, and was also criticized for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations. The FBI's decision to fire Strzok was seen as a victory for Trump, who had repeatedly denounced Strzok as "treasonous" and a "disgrace." Strzok's lawyer argued that the decision was "deeply troubling" and contradicted the FBI's typical practice. The inspector general's report had criticized Strzok's conduct, citing his "biased" state of mind and his decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over the Clinton email investigation. Strzok expressed "significant regret" for his actions and denied that his personal views had affected his work. The firing of Strzok, a 20-year veteran of the FBI, removes a favorite target of Trump's ire and gives the FBI a chance to move beyond the controversy. END OF SUMMARY.
