SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, an FBI senior counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies by sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump and for sending a sensitive search warrant to his personal email account. Mr. Strzok was a key figure in the early months of the Russia investigation and helped oversee the Hillary Clinton email investigation. The decision to fire Mr. Strzok has been criticized by his lawyer, who stated that it contradicts the FBI's typical practice and that there was no evidence that Mr. Strzok's personal views impacted his work. The inspector general's report found that Mr. Strzok's text messages demonstrated animosity toward Mr. Trump and cited this as indicative of a biased state of mind. Mr. Strzok's dismissal removes a target of criticism from the FBI and gives the bureau a chance to move beyond the president's ire. However, the firing has also been seen as a politically motivated effort to discredit Mr. Strzok and the Russia investigation, with Mr. Trump having repeatedly denounced Mr. Strzok and referring to the investigation as a "witch hunt." Mr. Strzok's lawyer denounced the decision, stating that it should be deeply troubling to all Americans and that Mr. Strzok's lengthy service to his country had been honored.
END OF SUMMARY.
