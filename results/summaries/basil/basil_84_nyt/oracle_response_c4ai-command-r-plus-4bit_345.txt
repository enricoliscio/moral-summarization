SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, has been fired for violating bureau policies and sending inflammatory text messages disparaging President Trump. Strzok helped oversee the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations and was accused of interfering in the investigations by imposing his political views. The inspector general's report criticized Strzok's conduct and use of personal email accounts, as well as his decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on new evidence in the Clinton investigation. Strzok's dismissal removes a target of Trump's unfounded assertions of a "deep state" and gives the FBI a chance to move beyond the president's ire. However, Strzok's lawyer denounced the dismissal as a departure from typical bureau practice and contradicts the FBI director's assurances of following regular process. The text messages exchanged between Strzok and Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer, demonstrated animosity toward Trump and implied a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate's electoral prospects. Strzok's dismissal follows the firing of another senior FBI agent, Andrew McCabe, for similar violations.
END OF SUMMARY.
