Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally charged words. First, I need to read through the article to understand the key points. Peter Strzok was fired from the FBI for violating policies, specifically sending sensitive emails and having inflammatory texts with Lisa Page. Trump and his allies used these texts to criticize the Russia investigation as a witch hunt. The inspector general's report found no evidence that his personal views affected the investigation but criticized his actions. The summary needs to include as many of the listed words as possible without exceeding 200 words. I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues, like the violation of policies, the impact on the investigation, and the political implications. I'll make sure to mention the firing, the texts, the investigation, and the inspector general's findings, using terms like "inflammatory," "violating," "investigation," and "bias." I also need to keep it concise and within the word limit. Let me draft this, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral framing is maintained.

SUMMARY: Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent, was fired for violating bureau policies, including sending inflammatory text messages and a sensitive search warrant to his personal email. The texts, exchanged with Lisa Page during the 2016 campaign, disparaged President Trump and implied a willingness to impact his electoral prospects. Trump and his allies criticized the Russia investigation as a politically motivated "witch hunt," and Strzok became a target of the president's ire. An inspector general’s report criticized Strzok’s conduct, finding no evidence his personal views affected his work but noting a biased state of mind. Strzok’s lawyer argued his firing was a departure from typical bureau practice and contradicted assurances of following regular processes. The firing removes a key figure from the FBI, allowing the agency to move beyond political pressure. Strzok’s dismissal was not unexpected, as he was the second senior FBI agent fired following the inspector general’s investigation. His lawyer denounced the decision, emphasizing that no evidence linked his personal views to his work. The case highlights tensions between political interference and professional integrity in investigative roles. END OF SUMMARY.
