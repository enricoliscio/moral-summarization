SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. Summers expressed confidence that Congress would pass the deal struck between President Obama and Republicans, despite criticism from liberal Democrats. Senate Democrats, however, requested changes to the bill, while House Democrats resisted the deal, arguing it gives too much to the wealthy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to address their concerns. Obama defended the deal, citing predictions of higher job growth if it is passed. Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl indicated that a tax cut bill could be on the Senate floor as early as Thursday, while House Democrats, led by Representatives DeFazio, McDermott, and Inslee, attempted to block the bill. Pelosi expressed opposition to the estate tax provision. End of Summary.
