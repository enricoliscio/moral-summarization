Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the moral implications.

The article is about Larry Summers warning that not passing a tax cut compromise could lead to a double-dip recession. He's confident Congress will pass the deal President Obama struck with Republicans. However, there's criticism from liberal Democrats who think the deal gives too much to the wealthy, like extending tax cuts for the rich and lowering estate taxes. They argue this doesn't help the economy much and are trying to block the bill. Some Democrats, like DeFazio, are opposing it and trying to get signatures to prevent the bill from being voted on without majority support. Pelosi mentions the estate tax part is a bridge too far. Obama defends the deal, saying economists predict job growth if it passes, and urges lawmakers to examine the details.

Now, the moral framing here seems to focus on the conflict between economic recovery and fairness. On one side, the administration and Summers argue that the tax cuts are necessary to prevent a recession, which is a moral imperative to protect the economy and jobs. On the other side, the Democrats are morally opposed because they believe it unfairly benefits the wealthy at the expense of the middle class and the overall fairness of the system. There's a tension between pragmatic economic measures and principles of equity and justice.

I need to capture this tension in the summary. The key points are Summers' warning, the Republican-Obama deal, criticism from Democrats about favoring the rich, attempts to block the bill, Pelosi's stance, and Obama's defense. I should mention the moral arguments on both sides without taking a side myself.

Let me structure the summary to include these elements concisely. I'll start with Summers' warning, then mention the deal and its critics, the attempts to block it, Pelosi's comment, and Obama's response. I'll make sure to highlight the moral conflict between preventing a recession and fairness.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise but include all the essential points. Let me check the word count as I draft.

Drafting:

Summers warns failure to pass tax cut compromise risks double-dip recession. Deal with Republicans extends tax cuts for rich and middle class, criticized by liberals. Dems try to block bill; DeFazio seeks signatures. Pelosi says estate tax part is too much. Obama defends deal, citing job growth. Conflict between economic recovery and fairness.

Wait, that's too short. I need to expand a bit more.

Summers warns that not passing the tax cut compromise could lead to a double-dip recession. The deal, negotiated by Obama with Republicans, extends tax cuts for both the rich and middle class, drawing criticism from liberal Democrats who argue it unfairly benefits the wealthy. Some Democrats are trying to block the bill, with DeFazio and others seeking signatures to prevent it from being voted on without majority support. Pelosi calls the estate tax provision a "bridge too far." Obama defends the deal, saying economists predict job growth if it passes, urging lawmakers to support it. The situation highlights a moral conflict between the need for economic recovery and concerns about fairness and equity.

That's about 150 words. I think that covers the main points and the moral framing.
