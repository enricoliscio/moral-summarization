SUMMARY:

Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession, which would stall the economy. He believes Congress will pass the deal, citing positive reviews from economists, and that it would be a failure to take a step that "materially increases the risk that this economy will stall out." However, Senate Democrats are seeking changes to the bill, and House Democrats are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy. They want to prevent the bill from coming to the floor, and are trying to get 60 signatures on a letter to block it. The deal has come under criticism from liberal Democrats, who see it as a giveaway to the rich that will do little to help the economy. President Obama rejected claims that he betrayed Democrats by cutting a deal with Republicans, urging lawmakers to examine the details and "get this done." But House Democrats are not listening, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling the estate tax provision "a bridge too far."
