Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to identify all the morally framed words. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts with Larry Summers warning about the risk of a double-dip recession if the tax cut isn't passed. He mentions that passing the bill would "materially increase the risk." The compromise has been criticized by liberal Democrats for extending tax cuts for the rich. So, words like "criticized," "compromise," "risk," "materially," "right thing," "give away," "giveaways," "unhappy," "betrayed," "rubber-stamping," "spike," "bridge too far," "fair," "responsible," "wrong," "unjust," "unacceptable," "failure," and "wrong" stand out as morally charged.

Next, I need to write a concise summary using these words. The summary should be under 200 words and include as many of these moral terms as possible. I'll structure it by highlighting the key points: Summers' warning, the criticism from Democrats, the provisions seen as giveaways, the opposition from House Democrats, Pelosi's stance, and Obama's response.

I'll make sure to mention the compromise, the risk of recession, the criticism, the provisions, the attempts to block the bill, Pelosi's "bridge too far," and Obama's urging. I'll keep it clear and concise, ensuring the moral framing is preserved throughout.

**SUMMARY:**
Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failing to pass a tax cut compromise would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The compromise, criticized by liberal Democrats for extending tax cuts for the wealthy, is seen as a "giveaway" to the rich. Some Democrats oppose the deal, arguing it unfairly benefits the wealthy while providing limited economic relief. House Democrats are resisting the compromise, with some even attempting to block it from reaching the floor. Senate Democrats have also requested changes to the bill, though specifics remain unclear. Vice President Biden has urged House Democrats to support the deal, emphasizing its potential to boost job growth. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the estate tax provision "a bridge too far," indicating strong opposition among Democrats. Obama defended the compromise, urging lawmakers to focus on its economic benefits. Despite this, House Democrats remain divided, with many rejecting the deal as unfair and irresponsible. The situation highlights deep divisions over what is seen as a failure to address economic needs fairly. END OF SUMMARY.
