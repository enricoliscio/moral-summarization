SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers issued a stark warning on Wednesday, predicting a heightened risk of a double-dip recession if Congress fails to pass the new tax cut compromise. The deal, struck between President Obama and Republicans, has sparked outrage among liberal Democrats due to its inclusion of tax cuts for the rich and a reduced estate tax for wealthy heirs. Despite criticism, Summers expressed confidence in Congress passing the deal, citing positive reviews from economists. Senate Democrats, however, requested changes to the bill, while House Democrats, led by Representatives DeFazio, McDermott, and Inslee, are attempting to block the bill from reaching the floor. They argue that the deal gives away too much to the wealthy and will have minimal impact on boosting the economy. Vice President Biden defended the agreement, emphasizing its potential for encouraging spending and aiding economic growth. President Obama also encouraged lawmakers to examine the deal's details, citing predictions of higher job growth if the agreement is passed. Nevertheless, House Democrats remain unconvinced, with Speaker Pelosi calling the estate tax provision "a bridge too far."

END OF SUMMARY.
