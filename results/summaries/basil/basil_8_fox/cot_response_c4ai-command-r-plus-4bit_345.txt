SUMMARY: 
Larry Summers warned that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. He believes that Congress will pass the deal, despite criticism from liberal Democrats who are resisting the extension of tax cuts for the rich. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats who are unhappy with the deal, believing it gives away too much to the wealthy. Some Democrats feel betrayed by Obama, claiming he negotiated with Republicans and gave away too much. Liberals are trying to block the bill and force a vote, saying they have had enough of jamming deals they don't like. Pelosi rejected the deal, calling the estate tax provision "a bridge too far." Obama urged lawmakers to examine the deal, stating that it will lead to higher job growth. END OF SUMMARY.
