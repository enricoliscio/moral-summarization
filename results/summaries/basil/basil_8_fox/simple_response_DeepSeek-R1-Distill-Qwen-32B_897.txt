Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Larry Summers warning that not passing a tax cut compromise could lead to a double-dip recession. He believes Congress will pass the deal Obama struck with Republicans, but there's criticism from liberal Democrats because it extends tax cuts for the rich and middle class. Economists are positive about the deal, but some Democrats are unhappy because they see it as giving too much to the wealthy. They want changes to the bill, and there's opposition in the House, with some trying to block the bill. Pelosi mentions the estate tax as a bridge too far. Obama is urging passage, saying it will help the economy, but House Democrats aren't convinced.

Now, I need to capture the moral framing. The author seems critical of the tax cut deal, especially the part about extending cuts for the wealthy. There's a tension between economic necessity and fairness. So, the summary should highlight that the deal is seen as a giveaway to the rich, causing internal conflict among Democrats, while Summers and Obama argue it's necessary to avoid a recession.

I should structure the summary to include the key players: Summers, Obama, Congress, and the opposing Democrats. Mention the criticism about the tax cuts for the wealthy, the potential economic risk, and the internal opposition within the Democratic party. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it reflects the moral concerns presented.

SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers has warned that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise could significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. Summers expressed confidence that Congress would avoid such a risky move, despite criticism from liberal Democrats who argue the deal excessively favors the wealthy. The agreement, struck by President Obama with Republicans, extends tax cuts for both the middle class and higher earners, while also lowering estate taxes for wealthy heirs. Critics, including some House Democrats, view these provisions as giveaways to the rich, with little economic benefit. Senate Democrats have requested changes to the bill, while House Democrats are resisting the deal, with some attempting to block its passage. Pelosi described the estate tax provision as "a bridge too far," and Vice President Biden has been meeting with House Democrats to urge support. Obama has countered criticism, emphasizing economists' predictions of job growth if the deal passes. However, House Democrats remain divided, with some rejecting the compromise. END OF SUMMARY.
