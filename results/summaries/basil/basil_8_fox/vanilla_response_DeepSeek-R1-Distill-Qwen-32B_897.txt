Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. 

The article is about Larry Summers, the outgoing White House economic adviser, warning that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise could lead to a double-dip recession. He thinks Congress will pass the deal Obama made with Republicans, despite criticism from liberal Democrats. The deal extends tax cuts for both the rich and middle class, which some Democrats oppose. 

Summers mentions that economists support the deal, so it's probably the right move. Senate Republicans are moving quickly, possibly bringing the bill to the floor soon. However, Senate Democrats are asking for changes, though they haven't specified what. 

There's also mention of Vice President Biden meeting with House Democrats who are against the deal, feeling it gives too much to the wealthy. The deal includes extended jobless benefits and a Social Security payroll tax cut, but some Democrats see it as a giveaway. 

Liberals are trying to prevent the bill from being brought to the floor by getting signatures to block it. Pelosi says there's not much support among Democrats. Obama defends the deal, saying economists predict better job growth if it passes, but House Democrats aren't buying it.

So, the key points are: Summers' warning about the economy, the tax cut deal's content, criticism from Democrats, the process in Congress, and the political maneuvering to block the bill.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the main actors and their positions. I'll structure it to include Summers' warning, the deal's details, the opposition, and the legislative process.
