SUMMARY:

Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession, which would stall the economy. He believes Congress will pass the deal, citing positive reviews from economists, and that it would be a failure to take a step that "materially increases the risk that this economy will stall out." However, Senate Democrats are seeking changes to the bill, and House Democrats are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy. They want to prevent the bill from coming to the floor, and some are even trying to block it from being voted on. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to urge them to get behind the deal, but they are not listening. The deal's provisions, including extending tax cuts for the rich and imposing a lower estate tax, are seen as giveaways to the wealthy that will do little to help the economy. END OF SUMMARY.
