SUMMARY:

Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession, which would materially increase the risk that the economy would stall out. He believes Congress will pass the deal President Obama struck with Republicans, despite withering criticism from liberal Democrats over the two-year extension of tax cuts for the rich as well as the middle class. Positive reviews from economists suggest the deal is the right thing to do. However, Senate Democrats are asking for changes to the bill, and House Democrats are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to try to get them on board, but some are determined to prevent the bill from reaching the floor. The deal's fate remains uncertain, with many Democrats unhappy about the concessions made to the rich.

END OF SUMMARY.
