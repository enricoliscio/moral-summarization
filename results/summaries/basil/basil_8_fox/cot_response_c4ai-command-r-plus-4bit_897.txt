SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers issued a warning that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession. The deal has faced criticism from liberal Democrats who are resisting the extension of tax cuts for the rich, arguing that it betrays Democratic values and gives away too much to the wealthy. Sen. Jon Kyl, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, assured reporters that a tax cut bill could be on the floor soon. However, Senate Democrats, led by Sen Dick Durbin, have requested changes to the bill, expressing their unhappiness with certain provisions. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to address their concerns, but some members remain resistant, claiming that the deal does little to aid the economy and is a betrayal of their principles. House Democrats, led by Reps. Peter DeFazio, Jim McDermott, and Jay Inslee, are even trying to block the bill from reaching the floor, forcing a vote in the caucus to demonstrate their rejection of the deal. Pelosi also rejected the deal, calling it "a bridge too far." The Obama administration, however, defended the deal, stating that it will lead to higher job growth and urging lawmakers to get it done. END OF SUMMARY.
