SUMMARY:
Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession. He believes that Congress will pass the deal President Obama struck with Republicans, despite withering criticism from liberal Democrats over the two-year extension of tax cuts for the rich as well as the middle class. Summers thinks it's the right thing to do, citing positive reviews from economists. However, Senate Democrats have asked for "changes" to the bill, and House Democrats are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy and is a "bridge too far." Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to address their concerns, but many are unhappy with the deal, feeling it's a betrayal of Democratic values. Obama rejected claims of betrayal, urging lawmakers to examine the details of the deal and "get this done." END OF SUMMARY.
