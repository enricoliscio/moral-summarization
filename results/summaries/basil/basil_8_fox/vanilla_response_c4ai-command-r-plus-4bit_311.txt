SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. He expressed confidence that Congress would approve the deal struck between President Obama and Republicans, despite criticism from liberal Democrats. Senate Democrats have requested changes to the bill, while House Democrats are resisting the deal, arguing it concedes too much to the wealthy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to address their concerns. Obama defended the deal, citing predictions of higher job growth if it is passed. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed skepticism, particularly regarding the estate tax provision. Sen. Jon Kyl indicated that a tax cut bill could reach the Senate floor soon, while some liberals are attempting to block the bill from advancing. Sen. Dick Durbin and Rep. Peter DeFazio echoed concerns about the deal, with DeFazio stating that House Democrats will no longer "rubber-stamp" deals they disagree with.
END OF SUMMARY.
