SUMMARY:

Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession, which would materially increase the risk that the economy would stall out. Summers believes that Congress will pass the deal President Obama struck with Republicans, despite withering criticism from liberal Democrats over the two-year extension of tax cuts for the rich as well as the middle class. However, Senate Democrats are seeking changes to the bill, and House Democrats are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy. Vice President Biden is trying to persuade House Democrats to get on board, but they are not listening. Reps. Peter DeFazio, Jim McDermott, and Jay Inslee are even trying to prevent the bill from coming to the floor. The deal's supporters argue that it would boost the economy, but critics see it as a giveaway to the rich that would do little to help the economy.

END OF SUMMARY.
