SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. Summers expressed confidence that Congress would pass the deal, which has faced criticism from liberal Democrats for extending tax cuts for the wealthy as well as the middle class. Senate Democrats, however, have requested changes to the bill. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats who are resisting the deal, while some liberal lawmakers are trying to block the bill from reaching the House floor. President Obama urged lawmakers to examine the deal, which is predicted to boost job growth, and get it passed. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed opposition to the estate tax provision, calling it "a bridge too far."

END OF SUMMARY.
