Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible, such as "failure," "raise," "increase," "stall," etc. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Larry Summers is warning about the risks of not passing the tax cut deal, which could lead to a double-dip recession. There's criticism from Democrats, especially regarding extending tax cuts for the wealthy. The deal includes provisions like extended jobless benefits and reduced Social Security taxes, but some Democrats are against it, trying to block it. Pelosi is involved, and there's tension between the administration and the House Democrats.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary, keeping it under 200 words. I should make sure to include the morally framed words where appropriate. For example, using "failure" when talking about not passing the bill, "increase" the risk, "stall" the economy, etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight the key points: Summers' warning, the criticism from Democrats, the provisions of the deal, the efforts to block it, and the administration's push for passage.

I'll start by stating the warning, then mention the criticism, the provisions, the attempts to prevent the bill, and end with the administration's stance. I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes the required words without making it sound forced.

Let me draft the summary step by step, checking each sentence to include the moral terms naturally. I'll make sure each paragraph isn't too long and that the key points are covered succinctly. Finally, I'll review to ensure it's under 200 words and that all the moral framing words are appropriately included.

SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession, stating it could stall the economy. He expressed confidence that Congress would avoid such a step, despite criticism from liberal Democrats over the two-year extension of tax cuts for the wealthy and middle class. economists have reviewed the deal positively, supporting its passage. Senate Republicans aim to bring the bill to the floor soon, while Senate Democrats have requested changes, though specifics remain unclear. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats resisting the deal, who argue it gives too much to the wealthy. The deal includes extended jobless benefits and reduced Social Security taxes, but many Democrats see it as a giveaway to the rich. Some House Democrats, including Reps. DeFazio, McDermott, and Inslee, are crafting a letter to prevent the bill from passing without majority support. Pelosi called the estate tax provision "a bridge too far," while Obama urged lawmakers to pass the deal, predicting higher job growth in 2011 and 2012. However, House Democrats remain unresponsive, with Pelosi noting the response has been "not very good." END OF SUMMARY.
