SUMMARY:

Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. He believes Congress will pass the deal, which has been criticized by liberal Democrats for extending tax cuts for the rich and middle class. Despite positive reviews from economists, Senate Democrats are seeking changes to the bill, and House Democrats are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to address their concerns, but some are trying to block the bill from coming to the floor. The deal has sparked controversy, with Democrats feeling betrayed by the extension of tax cuts for higher earners and the lower estate tax on wealthy heirs. The moral framing of this issue is clear: the wealthy are being prioritized over the needs of the economy and the most vulnerable members of society.
