SUMMARY:
Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession, which would "materially increase the risk that this economy will stall out." Summers believes that Congress will pass the deal President Obama struck with Republicans, despite liberal Democrats' criticism of the two-year extension of tax cuts for the rich as well as the middle class, which they see as "giveaways" to the wealthy. Senate Democrats, however, are seeking "changes" to the bill, and House Democrats are resisting the deal, saying it is a "betrayal" of Democratic values. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to try to persuade them to support the deal, but many are unhappy with the estate tax provision, calling it a "bridge too far." The deal's fate remains uncertain, with some Democrats determined to block it from coming to the floor. END OF SUMMARY.
