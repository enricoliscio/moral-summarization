SUMMARY:

Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession. Despite criticism from liberal Democrats, Summers believes Congress will pass the deal, which extends tax cuts for the rich and middle class, citing positive reviews from economists. However, Senate Democrats have asked for changes to the bill, and House Democrats are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to try to win them over, but some are trying to block the bill from coming to the floor. The deal has sparked controversy, with many Democrats seeing it as a giveaway to the rich that will do little to help the economy. The moral framing of this issue is clear: should the wealthy be prioritized over the needs of the economy and the unemployed?
