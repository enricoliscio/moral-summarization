SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers claimed that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. He believes that Congress will pass the deal, despite criticism from liberal Democrats over the extension of tax cuts for the rich. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats who are resisting the deal, but many are not listening, claiming that the deal gives away too much to the wealthy and will not help the economy. Liberals are trying to prevent the tax cut compromise from reaching the House floor, arguing that the White House has been negotiating deals without their support. President Obama urged lawmakers to examine the deal, stating that it will lead to higher job growth. However, House Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, remain unconvinced, criticizing the estate tax provision as "a bridge too far."

Summers warned that failure to act could stall the economy and increase the risk of a downturn. The moral framing of the article centers around the potential consequences of inaction, with Summers highlighting the risks of not passing the tax cut compromise.
