SUMMARY:

Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failure to pass the new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession. Despite criticism from liberal Democrats, Summers believes Congress will pass the deal, which extends tax cuts for the rich and middle class. Senate Democrats, however, are seeking changes to the bill, and House Democrats are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to try to sway them, but many are unhappy with the provisions, including the extension of expiring tax cuts for higher earners and the lower estate tax on wealthy heirs. Liberals are even trying to prevent the bill from coming to the floor. The deal's supporters argue it will boost the economy, but critics see it as a giveaway to the rich. The moral framing of this issue is clear: is it right to prioritize the wealthy over the needs of the economy and the unemployed?
