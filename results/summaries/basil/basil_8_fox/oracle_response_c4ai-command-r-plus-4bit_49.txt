SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would raise the risk of a double-dip recession. Summers believes that Congress will pass the deal, as positive reviews from economists show it is the right thing to do. However, some Senate and House Democrats are trying to prevent the bill from passing, arguing that it gives away too much to the wealthy and does not do enough to help the economy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to discuss their concerns, but the response has not been positive. Pelosi called the estate tax provision "a bridge too far." Summers warned that failure to act could stall the economy and increase the risk of a double-dip recession.
END OF SUMMARY.
