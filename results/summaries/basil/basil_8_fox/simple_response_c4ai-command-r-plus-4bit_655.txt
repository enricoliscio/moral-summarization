SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers issued a stark warning on Wednesday against failing to pass a new tax cut compromise, arguing that it would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession. The deal, struck between President Obama and Republicans, has faced criticism from liberal Democrats due to its extension of tax cuts for the wealthy as well as the middle class. Senate Democrats have requested "changes" to the bill, while House Democrats are resisting the deal, arguing it concedes too much to the wealthy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to address their concerns. Liberals are attempting to block the bill from reaching the House floor, citing a lack of support from Democratic representatives. Obama, however, defended the deal, highlighting its potential for higher job growth and urging lawmakers to examine its details. Pelosi, on the other hand, expressed dissatisfaction with the estate tax provision, deeming it unacceptable. Summers emphasized the economic benefits of the deal, stating that Congress would not take a step that increases the risk of an economic stall. Sen. Jon Kyl predicted an early Senate vote on the tax cut bill, despite requests for changes and ongoing resistance from Democrats.
END OF SUMMARY.
