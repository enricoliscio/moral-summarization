SUMMARY: White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that not passing a new tax cut compromise would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. He believes Congress will approve the deal, despite criticism from liberal Democrats who oppose the extension of tax cuts for the wealthy. Senate Democrats have requested changes to the bill, while House Democrats are resisting the deal, arguing it concedes too much to the rich. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to address their concerns. President Obama defended the deal, stating that it will lead to higher job growth. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed dissatisfaction with the estate tax provision. Sen. Jon Kyl predicted that a tax cut bill could reach the Senate floor soon, but an official analysis and price tag are still pending. Some House Democrats are attempting to block the bill, arguing that it goes against Democratic values.
END OF SUMMARY.
