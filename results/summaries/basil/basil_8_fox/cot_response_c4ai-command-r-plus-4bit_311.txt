SUMMARY: 
White House economic adviser Larry Summers issued a *warning* Wednesday that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The deal, *criticized* by liberal Democrats and some House members, includes a two-year extension of tax cuts for both the middle class and the rich, as well as a lower estate tax for wealthy heirs. Some Democrats are *resisting* the deal, *unhappy* with the concessions made to the rich, which they argue will not significantly aid the economy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to address their concerns, but they remain *unhappy* with the deal. President Obama *rejected claims* that he *betrayed* Democrats by negotiating with Republicans, citing predictions of higher job growth if the deal is passed. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats continue to *criticize* the estate tax provision as a *betrayal*. Summers *warned* that failing to pass the deal would stall the economy and urged Congress to act, expressing confidence that the bill will be passed. The future of the bill remains uncertain as Senate Democrats have requested "changes" and House Democrats are considering blocking it from reaching the floor.
