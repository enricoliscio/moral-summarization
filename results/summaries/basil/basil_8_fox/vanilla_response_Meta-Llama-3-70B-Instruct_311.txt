SUMMARY:

Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. He expressed confidence that Congress would pass the deal struck by President Obama with Republicans, despite criticism from liberal Democrats. The deal extends tax cuts for the rich and middle class, and includes provisions for extended jobless benefits and a cut in Social Security payroll taxes. However, Senate Democrats have asked for changes to the bill, and House Democrats are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to try to win their support, but some are trying to block the bill from coming to the floor. President Obama rejected claims that he betrayed Democrats by cutting a deal with Republicans, and urged lawmakers to pass the agreement to boost job growth.

END OF SUMMARY.
