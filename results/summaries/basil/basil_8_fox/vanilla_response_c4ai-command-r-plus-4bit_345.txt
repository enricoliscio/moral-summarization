SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The deal, struck between President Obama and Republicans, has faced criticism from liberal Democrats due to its inclusion of tax cuts for the rich. Senate Democrats have requested changes to the bill, while House Democrats are resisting the deal, arguing it concedes too much to the wealthy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to address their concerns. President Obama urged lawmakers to examine the deal, stating that economists predict higher job growth if it is passed. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats remain unconvinced, criticizing the estate tax provision as excessive. Meanwhile, some liberal House Democrats are attempting to block the bill from reaching the floor, arguing that they will not continue to support deals they disagree with. Summers expressed confidence that Congress will pass the deal, reducing the risk of an economic stall.
END OF SUMMARY.
