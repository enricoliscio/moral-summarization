SUMMARY: Failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession, according to outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers. He warned that Congress should pass the deal struck between President Obama and Republicans, which has faced criticism from liberal Democrats due to its inclusion of tax cuts for the rich. Senate Democrats have requested changes to the bill, while House Democrats are resisting the deal, arguing it gives too much to the wealthy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to address their concerns. Obama defended the deal, stating that economists predict higher job growth if the agreement is passed. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats remain unconvinced, with Pelosi calling the estate tax provision "a bridge too far." The challenge for Democrats is to prevent the bill from stalling out and to get enough support to pass the deal, which Summers and Obama believe is crucial for the economy.
END OF SUMMARY.
