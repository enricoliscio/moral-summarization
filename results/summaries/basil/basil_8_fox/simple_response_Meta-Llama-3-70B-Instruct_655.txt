SUMMARY:

Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. He believes Congress will pass the deal struck by President Obama with Republicans, despite criticism from liberal Democrats over the extension of tax cuts for the rich. However, Senate Democrats are seeking changes to the bill, and House Democrats are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to try to persuade them to support the deal, which includes extended jobless benefits and a cut in Social Security payroll taxes. Liberals are trying to block the bill from coming to the floor, with some accusing the White House of betraying Democrats by cutting a deal with Republicans. Obama rejected these claims, urging lawmakers to examine the details of the deal and pass it to boost job growth.
