SUMMARY:

Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise could lead to a double-dip recession. He believes Congress will pass the deal struck by President Obama with Republicans, despite criticism from liberal Democrats over the extension of tax cuts for the rich and middle class. Senate Democrats, however, are seeking changes to the bill, while Vice President Biden met with House Democrats who are resisting the deal. Many Democrats are unhappy with the extension of tax cuts for higher earners and the lower estate tax on wealthy heirs, seeing them as giveaways to the rich. In return, Democrats would get extended jobless benefits and a cut in Social Security payroll taxes. Liberals are trying to block the bill from reaching the floor, with some House Democrats vowing not to "rubber-stamp" deals they don't like. President Obama rejected claims that he betrayed Democrats by cutting a deal with Republicans, urging lawmakers to pass the agreement.
