Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Larry Summers warning that not passing a tax cut compromise could lead to a double-dip recession. He believes Congress will pass the deal Obama made with Republicans, which extends tax cuts for both the rich and middle class. However, this has been criticized by liberal Democrats who think it's a giveaway to the wealthy. They're upset because it doesn't help the economy much but benefits the rich. Some Democrats are trying to block the bill, and there's internal conflict within the party. Pelosi is involved, and Biden is trying to get House Democrats on board. Obama is urging passage, saying it will help job growth, but House Democrats aren't convinced.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral framing. The author seems critical of the deal, highlighting the conflict between economic necessity and fairness. So, the summary should reflect that tension: the potential economic benefits vs. the moral concern of favoring the wealthy.

I should structure the summary to first mention Summers' warning, then the criticism from liberals, the internal conflict, and Obama's stance. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral aspects are clear.

Let me start drafting:

Summers warns that failing to pass the tax cut deal risks a double-dip recession. However, liberal Democrats criticize the deal for extending tax cuts to the wealthy, arguing it's a giveaway that doesn't help the economy. There's internal conflict as some Democrats try to block the bill, while Obama urges passage for economic growth. Pelosi calls the estate tax part a bridge too far, showing the party's division.

Wait, that's a bit too short. I need to include more details without exceeding 200 words. Let me add more specifics about the provisions and the efforts to block the bill.

Summers warns that failing to pass the tax cut compromise risks a double-dip recession, but liberal Democrats criticize the deal for extending tax cuts to the wealthy, arguing it's a giveaway that doesn't sufficiently aid the economy. There's internal conflict as some House Democrats, like DeFazio, are trying to block the bill, while Obama urges passage, citing economic benefits. Pelosi calls the estate tax provision a bridge too far, highlighting the party's divisions over fairness and economic necessity.

That's better. It includes the key points and the moral framing about fairness vs. economic risk.

SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers has warned that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise could significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. While Summers believes Congress will ultimately approve the deal struck by President Obama with Republicans, the agreement has faced strong criticism from liberal Democrats. They argue that extending tax cuts for the wealthy, in addition to the middle class, is a giveaway to the rich and does little to stimulate the economy. Some House Democrats, including Rep. Peter DeFazio, are attempting to block the bill, while Obama urges lawmakers to pass it, citing predictions of higher job growth. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Vice President Biden are working to secure support, but House Democrats remain divided, with Pelosi calling the estate tax provision "a bridge too far." The debate highlights a tension between economic necessity and concerns over fairness and inequality. END OF SUMMARY.
