Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words: failure, raise, increase, stall, have, reviews, deal, prevent, get, listening. My task is to make sure these words are included in the summary as much as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Larry Summers is warning about the risk of a double-dip recession if the tax cut compromise isn't passed. The deal has been criticized by liberals because it extends tax cuts for the wealthy as well as the middle class. Some Democrats are resisting the deal, and there's internal conflict within the party. Pelosi is involved, and there's a push to prevent the bill from passing without majority support.

I need to structure the summary to include the key elements: the warning from Summers, the criticism from liberals, the internal conflict among Democrats, and the attempts to prevent the bill. I should use the morally framed words where appropriate. For example, "failure to pass" uses "failure," "raise the risk" uses "raise," "increase the risk" uses "increase," "stall" is used in the original, "deal" is central, "prevent" is used by the Democrats trying to stop the bill, "get" might be used in the context of passing or getting the bill done, and "listening" as Pelosi says they're not listening.

I'll start by mentioning Summers' warning about failure to pass the bill increasing the risk of a double-dip recession. Then, note the criticism from liberals. Next, describe the internal conflict and attempts to prevent the bill. Finally, mention Pelosi's statement about not listening and the push for a resolution.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure all the key points are covered with the moral framing words included where they fit naturally.

SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession. He emphasized that Congress would not take a step that materially increases the risk of the economy stalling out. However, the deal, which extends tax cuts for both the rich and middle class, has faced criticism from liberal Democrats. Senate Democrats have requested changes to the bill, while House Democrats are resisting it, claiming it gives too much to the wealthy. Liberals are attempting to prevent the compromise from reaching the floor, with some crafting a letter to block the bill. Despite this, Obama urged lawmakers to examine the deal and "get this done," but House Democrats are not listening, as Pelosi acknowledged. The internal conflict highlights divisions over the estate tax provision, seen as a "bridge too far" for many. END OF SUMMARY.
