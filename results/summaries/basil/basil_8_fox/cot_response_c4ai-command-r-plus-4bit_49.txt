SUMMARY: 
Larry Summers, the outgoing White House economic adviser, issued a stark *warning*: failing to pass the new tax cut compromise would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. This deal has faced *criticism* from liberal Democrats who oppose the extension of tax cuts for the rich. In the face of this opposition, Summers expressed confidence that Congress would ultimately pass the deal, arguing that it is the right thing to do for the economy. However, Senate Democrats have requested *changes* to the bill, and House Democrats are *resisting* the deal, viewing it as a *betrayal* by the Obama administration. They are *unhappy* with the extension of tax cuts for higher earners and the lower estate tax for wealthy heirs, considering them as *giveaways* to the rich. A group of House Democrats, led by Representatives DeFazio, McDermott, and Inslee, are *trying* to *force* a vote in the caucus to *block* the bill. They argue that they will no longer *rubber-stamp* deals they disagree with. Despite these challenges, Obama defended the deal, emphasizing its potential for job growth, and urged lawmakers to get it done. However, Speaker Pelosi described the estate tax provision as "a *bridge* too far," indicating the challenges the bill faces in the Democratic-controlled House.
