SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers issued a dire warning on Wednesday, predicting a heightened risk of a double-dip recession if Congress fails to pass the newly brokered tax cut compromise. This deal, which has faced significant backlash from liberal Democrats, includes a two-year extension of tax cuts for both the middle class and the wealthy, along with a reduced estate tax for wealthy heirs. In exchange, Democrats secured extended jobless benefits and a reduction in Social Security payroll taxes for workers, intended to boost the economy. Despite the criticism, Summers expressed confidence in Congress's eventual approval of the deal, citing positive reviews from economists. However, Senate Democrats have requested unspecified changes to the bill, while House Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have strongly opposed the agreement, particularly the concessions made to the rich. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to address their concerns, but they remain unconvinced, arguing that the deal gives too much away. President Obama defended the compromise, citing predictions of higher job growth, but his pleas seem to have fallen on deaf ears within his own party. Summers' warning underscores the urgency of finding a solution to support economic recovery, even as Democrats struggle to reconcile their principles with the political realities of divided government.
END OF SUMMARY.
