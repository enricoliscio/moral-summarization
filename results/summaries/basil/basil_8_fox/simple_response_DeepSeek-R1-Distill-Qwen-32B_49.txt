Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about Larry Summers warning that not passing a tax cut deal could lead to a double-dip recession. He believes Congress will pass it, but there's criticism from liberals because it extends tax cuts for the rich. The deal also includes jobless benefits and a Social Security tax cut. Some Democrats are opposing it, trying to block it, while Obama and Biden support it, saying it's good for the economy. Pelosi thinks the estate tax part is too much.

I need to capture the key points: the warning about the economy, the tax cut details, the opposition from Democrats, and the administration's stance. Also, the moral framing is about fairness and economic impact. I should make sure to include that Summers and Obama see it as necessary for the economy, while liberals oppose it as favoring the wealthy.

Let me structure this into a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words. I'll mention the main actors, their positions, and the implications. Make sure to highlight the moral arguments on both sides: economic necessity vs. fairness to the wealthy.

SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers has warned that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise could significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. Summers believes Congress will approve the deal struck by President Obama with Republicans, despite criticism from liberal Democrats who oppose extending tax cuts for the wealthy. The agreement includes extended jobless benefits and a reduction in Social Security payroll taxes, but some Democrats argue it unfairly favors the rich. Senate Democrats have requested changes to the bill, while House Democrats, led by Rep. Peter DeFazio, are attempting to block the compromise. Vice President Biden has urged lawmakers to support the deal, citing economic benefits, but House Democrats remain skeptical. Obama rejects claims of betrayal, emphasizing the deal's potential to boost job growth. Pelosi has criticized the estate tax provision, calling it "a bridge too far." The debate highlights divisions over economic necessity versus fairness. END OF SUMMARY.
