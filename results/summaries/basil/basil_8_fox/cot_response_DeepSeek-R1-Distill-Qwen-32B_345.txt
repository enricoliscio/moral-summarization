Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral language used. The article is about the tax cut compromise and the reactions from different political figures.

The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry moral connotations, like "betrayal," "criticism," "unfair," etc. I'll list them each on a new line with a star.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of those morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and should capture the main points: Larry Summers' warning, the criticism from Democrats, the details of the tax deal, and the internal conflict within the Democratic party.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral perspectives from both sides. Larry Summers is warning about the economic risks, while Democrats are criticizing the deal as unfair to the middle class. The summary should reflect the tension and the different moral viewpoints presented in the article.

I also need to make sure that the summary flows well and covers all the essential elements without being too detailed. I'll focus on the key players: Larry Summers, the Democrats opposing the deal, the specific provisions of the tax cut, and the political maneuvering within the House.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it meets the word limit and accurately represents the moral framing from the original article.

**SUMMARY:**  

Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failing to pass a tax cut compromise could increase the risk of a double-dip recession. He expressed confidence that Congress would avoid such a risk, despite criticism from liberal Democrats who view the deal as a giveaway to the wealthy. The agreement, struck by President Obama with Republicans, extends tax cuts for both the middle class and high earners, while also lowering estate taxes for wealthy heirs. These provisions have been criticized as unfair, as they benefit the rich while doing little to aid the economy. Democrats, however, would gain extended jobless benefits and a reduction in Social Security payroll taxes. Some House Democrats, including Reps. Peter DeFazio, Jim McDermott, and Jay Inslee, are attempting to block the bill, arguing it lacks majority support. Pelosi described the estate tax provision as "a bridge too far," while Obama defended the deal, emphasizing its potential to boost job growth. The internal conflict within the Democratic party highlights the moral and political tensions surrounding the compromise.
