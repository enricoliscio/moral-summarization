SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers issued a stark warning on Wednesday, arguing that failing to pass the new tax cut compromise would greatly increase the likelihood of a double-dip recession. He expressed confidence that Congress would approve the deal, despite criticism from liberal Democrats who oppose the extension of tax cuts for the wealthy. Senators are already taking steps to move the bill forward, but some House Democrats are attempting to block it, arguing that it concedes too much to the rich without providing sufficient benefits for the middle class and the economy. Vice President Biden and President Obama are urging lawmakers to carefully consider the deal, highlighting its potential for boosting job growth. However, House Democrats remain unconvinced, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi describing the estate tax provision as "a bridge too far." The dilemma facing Congress is whether to risk economic stagnation by rejecting the deal or to accept an agreement that goes against their principles and risks exacerbating income inequality.
END OF SUMMARY.
