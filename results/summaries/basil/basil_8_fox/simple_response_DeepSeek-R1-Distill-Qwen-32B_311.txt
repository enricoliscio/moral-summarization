Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the moral perspectives involved.

The article is about Larry Summers warning that not passing a tax cut compromise could lead to a double-dip recession. He thinks Congress will pass the deal Obama made with Republicans, but it's facing criticism from liberal Democrats. They're upset because the deal extends tax cuts for the rich as well as the middle class. Some Democrats are trying to block the bill, arguing it's a giveaway to the wealthy. The deal includes extended jobless benefits and a payroll tax cut, which are meant to help the economy. Pelosi is against the estate tax part, calling it a bridge too far. Biden is trying to get House Democrats on board, but there's resistance. Obama defends the deal, saying economists predict better job growth if it passes.

Now, the moral framing here seems to be around fairness and economic impact. The author presents the Democrats as concerned about the deal favoring the wealthy, which they see as unfair. They argue it doesn't help the economy enough. On the other hand, Summers and Obama emphasize the economic risks of not passing the deal and the potential benefits from job growth.

I need to make sure the summary captures this tension. It should mention the key players, their arguments, and the potential consequences. I'll structure it to first state the warning from Summers, then the criticism from Democrats, the provisions of the deal, the resistance, and the response from Obama.

I should keep it under 200 words and ensure it's concise. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failing to pass a tax cut compromise could risk a double-dip recession. He expressed confidence Congress would approve the deal struck by President Obama with Republicans, despite criticism from liberal Democrats who oppose extending tax cuts for the wealthy. Some Democrats are resisting the deal, arguing it unfairly benefits the rich, while others support provisions like extended jobless benefits and a payroll tax cut to boost the economy. Senate Democrats have requested changes to the bill, while House Democrats, led by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, are divided. Vice President Biden is working to garner support, but some House Democrats, including Rep. Peter DeFazio, are seeking to block the bill. Obama defended the deal, citing economists' predictions of job growth, urging Congress to act. Pelosi criticized the estate tax provision, calling it "a bridge too far." END OF SUMMARY.
