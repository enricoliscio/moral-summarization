SUMMARY:

Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. He believes Congress will pass the deal struck by President Obama with Republicans, despite criticism from liberal Democrats over the extension of tax cuts for the rich. Senate Democrats, however, are seeking changes to the bill. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats who are resisting the deal, which they say gives away too much to the wealthy. Some Democrats are unhappy about the extension of expiring tax cuts for higher earners and the lower estate tax on wealthy heirs. In return, Democrats would get extended jobless benefits and a cut in Social Security payroll taxes. Liberals are trying to block the bill from reaching the floor, with some House Democrats saying they won't rubber-stamp deals they don't like.

END OF SUMMARY.
