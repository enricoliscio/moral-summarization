SUMMARY:
Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession. He believes that Congress will pass the deal President Obama struck with Republicans, despite withering criticism from liberal Democrats over the two-year extension of tax cuts for the rich as well as the middle class. Summers thinks it's the right thing to do, citing positive reviews from economists. However, Senate Democrats are asking for changes to the bill, and House Democrats are resisting the deal, calling it a "giveaway" to the wealthy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to try to persuade them, but many are unhappy with the deal, feeling it betrays Democratic values. Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the estate tax provision "a bridge too far." END OF SUMMARY.
