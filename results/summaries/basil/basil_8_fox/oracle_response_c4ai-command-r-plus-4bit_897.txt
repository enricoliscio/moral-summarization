SUMMARY: Failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession, outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned Wednesday. Summers added that he thinks Congress will pass the deal, which has come under criticism from liberal Democrats over the extension of tax cuts for the rich. He said that positive reviews from economists show the deal is the right thing to do and that Congress would not want to materially increase the risk of the economy stalling out. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats who are resisting the deal, but some are trying to prevent the bill from even being brought to the floor. They argue that the deal gives away too much to the wealthy and does little to help the economy. In contrast, President Obama urged lawmakers to examine the details of the deal, saying that economists predict higher job growth if it is passed. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats are not listening, with Pelosi calling the estate tax provision "a bridge too far."
END OF SUMMARY.
