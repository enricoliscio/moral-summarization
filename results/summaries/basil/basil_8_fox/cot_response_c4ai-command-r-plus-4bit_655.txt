SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warns that failure to pass a tax cut *compromise* with Republicans would increase the risk of a *double-dip recession*. Summers believes that the deal struck by President Obama is the *right* thing to do for the economy, but some liberal Democrats are *resisting* it, *unhappy* with the extension of tax cuts for the wealthy. These Democrats view the deal as *giveaways* to the rich. In an attempt to *prevent* the deal from passing, some House Democrats are *blocking* the bill and *forcing* a vote in the caucus. Rep. Peter DeFazio accuses the White House of *betraying* Democrats by cutting a deal with Republicans and *jamming* it through Congress. He asserts that it is *enough* and that they will *get* their way. The deal includes an extension of jobless benefits and a cut in Social Security payroll taxes to boost the economy. The news article concludes with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's disapproval of the estate tax provision, calling it "a bridge too far."
END OF SUMMARY.
