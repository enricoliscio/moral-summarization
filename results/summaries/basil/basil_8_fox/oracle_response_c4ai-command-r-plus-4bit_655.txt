SUMMARY: Failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession, warned outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers. He stated that not passing the deal struck between President Obama and Republicans would increase the chance of the economy stalling and suffering a double-dip recession. While some Senate Democrats have asked for changes to the bill, others like Sen. Jon Kyl believe that the tax cut bill could be on the Senate floor soon. Vice President Biden has been trying to prevent resistance from House Democrats, who believe the deal gives too much to the wealthy. They are trying to block the bill from reaching the House floor, but Obama has urged lawmakers to examine the details of the deal, stating that economists predict higher job growth if the agreement is passed. However, House Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are not listening to these pleas, with Pelosi calling the estate tax provision "a bridge too far."
END OF SUMMARY.
