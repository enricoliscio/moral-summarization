SUMMARY:
Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession, materially increasing the risk that the economy would stall out. Summers believes Congress will pass the deal, which has come under withering criticism from liberal Democrats over the two-year extension of tax cuts for the rich as well as the middle class, seen as giveaways to the wealthy that will do little to help the economy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats who are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy. Some Democrats are unhappy that Obama agreed to extend expiring tax cuts for higher earners and impose a lower estate tax on wealthy heirs, seen as a bridge too far. Obama rejected claims that he betrayed Democrats by cutting a deal with Republicans, urging lawmakers to examine the details of the deal and get it done. END OF SUMMARY.
