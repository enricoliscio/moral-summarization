SUMMARY:

Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession, which would materially increase the risk that the economy would stall out. Summers believes Congress will pass the deal President Obama struck with Republicans, despite withering criticism from liberal Democrats over the two-year extension of tax cuts for the rich. Positive reviews from economists suggest the deal is the right thing to do. However, Senate Democrats are seeking changes to the bill, and House Democrats are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to address their concerns, but some are trying to prevent the bill from reaching the floor. Liberals are unhappy with the deal, which they see as a giveaway to the rich, and are seeking a record vote in the caucus to block the bill.

END OF SUMMARY.
