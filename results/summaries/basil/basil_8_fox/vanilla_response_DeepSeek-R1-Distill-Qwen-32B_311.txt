Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the tax cut compromise. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts with Larry Summers warning that failing to pass the tax cut bill could lead to a double-dip recession. He thinks Congress will pass it because they don't want to risk the economy stalling. The deal was made between Obama and Republicans, but it's been criticized by liberal Democrats for extending tax cuts for the rich as well as the middle class.

Summers mentions that economists are positive about the deal, supporting its passage. Senate Republicans are moving quickly, possibly bringing the bill to the floor by Thursday. However, Senate Democrats are asking for changes, though they haven't specified what. The Joint Committee on Taxation hasn't scored the bill yet, but the Senate might proceed anyway.

Vice President Biden met with House Democrats who oppose the deal, feeling it gives too much to the wealthy. The deal includes extending tax cuts for both middle class and higher earners, lowering estate taxes, and in return, extends jobless benefits and cuts Social Security payroll taxes. Some Democrats are trying to block the bill, with representatives crafting a letter to prevent it from being voted on without majority support.

Obama defends the deal, saying economists predict better job growth if it passes, urging Congress to act. Pelosi mentions that the estate tax part is too much, indicating House Democrats aren't fully on board.

So, the summary needs to capture the key points: Summers' warning, the content of the deal, criticism from Democrats, the push from Republicans, Biden's efforts, and Obama's defense. I need to condense this into under 200 words, making sure to include all main elements without getting too detailed.
