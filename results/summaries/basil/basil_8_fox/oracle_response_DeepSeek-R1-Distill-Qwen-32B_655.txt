Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words: failure, raise, increase, stall, have, reviews, deal, prevent, get, listening. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Larry Summers is warning about the risk of a double-dip recession if the tax cut deal isn't passed. There's criticism from liberal Democrats about extending tax cuts for the wealthy. Congress is considering changes, and there's opposition within the Democratic party, especially in the House. The deal includes provisions that some see as giveaways to the rich, but it also has benefits like extended unemployment benefits and lower payroll taxes.

Now, I'll structure the summary. Start with Summers' warning about failure to pass the deal increasing the risk of a double-dip recession. Mention the criticism from liberals and the potential for the Senate to move quickly. Then, note the internal Democratic opposition, the attempts to prevent the bill, and Pelosi's criticism of the estate tax provision. End with Obama urging passage despite House Democrats' reluctance.

I need to incorporate the morally framed words. Use "failure" in the first sentence. "Raise" the risk, "increase" the risk. The deal is seen as a "giveaway," which is a moral judgment. "Prevent" the bill from being passed, and "listening" to the details. Make sure the summary flows naturally while including these words.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft it, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms without making it sound forced. Check for the inclusion of all the key points: Summers' warning, criticism, Senate action, Democratic opposition, Pelosi's stance, and Obama's urging.

Finally, ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession. He emphasized that Congress would not take a step that materially increases the risk of the economy stalling out. Summers noted positive reviews from economists supporting the deal, which includes extending tax cuts for both the middle class and higher earners, as well as lower estate taxes for wealthy heirs. However, liberal Democrats criticize the deal as a giveaway to the rich, with some attempting to prevent it from being passed. Senate Democrats have requested changes to the bill, while House Democrats, led by Reps. DeFazio, McDermott, and Inslee, are crafting a letter to block the bill unless a majority supports it. Pelosi called the estate tax provision "a bridge too far," while Obama urged lawmakers to pass the deal, citing economic benefits. Despite his efforts, House Democrats remain reluctant to listen and approve the compromise. END OF SUMMARY.
