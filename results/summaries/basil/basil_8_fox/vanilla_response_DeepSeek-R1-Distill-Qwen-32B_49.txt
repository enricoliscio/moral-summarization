Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Larry Summers warning that failing to pass a new tax cut could lead to a double-dip recession. He thinks Congress will pass the deal Obama made with Republicans, but there's criticism from Democrats. The deal extends tax cuts for both the rich and middle class, which some Democrats oppose because they see it as giving too much to the wealthy. The benefits include extended unemployment benefits and a Social Security payroll tax cut. However, some House Democrats are trying to block the bill, and Pelosi is against the estate tax part. Obama is urging passage, but House Democrats aren't convinced. I need to condense all this into a 200-word summary, focusing on the key points: Summers' warning, the tax deal's content, Democratic opposition, Pelosi's stance, and Obama's push. I should make sure to mention the possible double-dip recession, the split among Democrats, and the current status of the bill in Congress. Let me structure it clearly, starting with the warning, then the deal details, followed by the opposition and the ongoing debate.

SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise could significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. Summers expressed confidence that Congress would approve the deal struck by President Obama with Republicans, despite criticism from liberal Democrats over extending tax cuts for the wealthy. The agreement includes extended unemployment benefits and a reduction in Social Security payroll taxes. However, some House Democrats are opposing the deal, with Reps. Peter DeFazio, Jim McDermott, and Jay Inslee drafting a letter to block the bill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is considering changes to the legislation, while Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to garner support. Pelosi criticized the estate tax provision, calling it "a bridge too far." Obama urged lawmakers to pass the deal, citing economic benefits, but House Democrats remain divided. END OF SUMMARY.
