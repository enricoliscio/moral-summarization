Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about Larry Summers warning that not passing a tax cut compromise could lead to a double-dip recession. He thinks Congress will pass the deal Obama made with Republicans, but there's criticism from Democrats. The deal extends tax cuts for both the rich and middle class, which some Democrats oppose because they think it benefits the wealthy too much. There are mentions of changes requested by Senate Democrats and internal conflicts within the House Democrats about supporting the bill. Pelosi is involved, and some are trying to block the bill from being voted on. Obama is pushing for the deal, saying it's supported by economists, but House Democrats aren't convinced.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Summers' warning and the potential recession. Then, outline the deal's components and the criticism from Democrats. Highlight the internal conflicts and Pelosi's stance. End with Obama's support and the uncertainty in the House.

I should make sure to include key points: the tax cut extension, criticism over benefits to the wealthy, changes requested by Senate Democrats, House Democrats' resistance, Pelosi's "bridge too far" comment, and Obama's encouragement to pass the bill. Keep it concise and cover all main aspects without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise could increase the risk of a double-dip recession. He expressed confidence that Congress would approve the deal struck by President Obama with Republicans, despite criticism from liberal Democrats over its extension of tax cuts for the wealthy. Senate Republicans indicated the bill could be debated as early as Thursday, while Senate Democrats requested changes to the proposal. House Democrats, including Reps. Peter DeFazio, Jim McDermott, and Jay Inslee, are opposing the deal, arguing it benefits the wealthy at the expense of the economy. They are attempting to block the bill from reaching the floor by collecting signatures for a resolution. Pelosi called the estate tax provision "a bridge too far," while Obama urged lawmakers to support the deal, citing economic benefits. END OF SUMMARY.
