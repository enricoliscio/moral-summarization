Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about Larry Summers warning that not passing a tax cut deal could cause a double-dip recession. He believes Congress will pass it despite criticism from Democrats. The deal extends tax cuts for both the rich and middle class, which some Democrats oppose, saying it's a giveaway. They also mention jobless benefits and Social Security tax cuts as positives.

There's mention of Senate Republicans possibly moving the bill quickly, but Senate Democrats are asking for changes. House Democrats are resisting, with some trying to block the bill by getting signatures. Pelosi is involved, and she's critical of the estate tax part. Obama supports the deal, saying it's good for job growth, but House Democrats aren't on board.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, focusing on key points: Summers' warning, the tax deal's provisions, opposition from Democrats, Pelosi's stance, and Obama's support.

I'll structure it by starting with Summers' warning, then the deal's details, followed by the opposition and the current political situation in Congress.

SUMMARY: Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failing to pass a new tax cut compromise could increase the risk of a double-dip recession. Summers believes Congress will approve the deal struck by President Obama with Republicans, despite criticism from liberal Democrats over extending tax cuts for the wealthy. The deal includes extended jobless benefits and a reduced Social Security payroll tax for workers. However, some Democrats oppose the agreement, arguing it favors the wealthy. Senate Republicans aim to move the bill quickly, while Senate Democrats seek changes. House Democrats, led by Reps. DeFazio, McDermott, and Inslee, are drafting a letter to block the bill, requiring 60 signatures. Pelosi criticized the estate tax provision, calling it "a bridge too far." Obama defended the deal, citing economists' predictions of job growth, but House Democrats remain resistant. END OF SUMMARY.
