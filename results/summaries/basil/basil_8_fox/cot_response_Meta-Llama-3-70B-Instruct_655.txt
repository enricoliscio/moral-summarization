SUMMARY:
Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession. He believes Congress will pass the deal President Obama struck with Republicans, despite withering criticism from liberal Democrats over the two-year extension of tax cuts for the rich. Summers thinks the deal is the right thing to do, citing positive reviews from economists. However, Senate Democrats are asking for changes to the bill, and House Democrats are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to address their concerns, but some are unhappy with the provisions, calling them giveaways to the rich. Despite this, Obama rejected claims of betrayal and urged lawmakers to pass the agreement, which he believes will lead to higher job growth in 2011 and 2012. END OF SUMMARY.
