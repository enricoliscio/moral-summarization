SUMMARY:

Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warns that failing to pass the new tax cut compromise would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. He believes Congress will pass the deal, which has come under criticism from liberal Democrats for extending tax cuts for the rich and middle class. Despite positive reviews from economists, Senate Democrats are seeking changes to the bill, and House Democrats are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to address their concerns, but some are determined to block the bill from reaching the floor. The deal has sparked controversy, with critics arguing that it prioritizes the interests of the wealthy over those of the working class. As President Obama urges lawmakers to pass the agreement, House Democrats remain skeptical, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling the estate tax provision "a bridge too far."
