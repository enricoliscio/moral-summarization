Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to identify the morally framed words first. Let me read through the article again to understand the context.

The article talks about Larry Summers warning about the risk of a double-dip recession if the tax cut compromise isn't passed. There's a lot of back-and-forth between Democrats and Republicans, especially about extending tax cuts for the rich. Some Democrats are upset because they think the deal gives too much to the wealthy. They're trying to block the bill, and there's some internal conflict within the Democratic party.

Now, for the morally framed words. I need to look for words that carry a moral judgment, like "criticism," "give away," "betray," "unhappy," "unfair," "bridge too far," "rubber-stamping," "spear carrier," "jam," "unjust," "unfair," "unjustified," "immoral," "unconscionable," "unjust," "unfair," "unjustified," "immoral," "unconscionable." Wait, but the article doesn't explicitly use all these words. Let me check again.

The article mentions "withering criticism," "give away," "betray," "unhappy," "give away," "give away," "rubber-stamping," "spear carrier," "jam," "bridge too far." So those are the morally charged words.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise. The summary should reflect the moral framing, so I'll use words like "criticism," "give away," "betray," "unhappy," "rubber-stamping," "spear carrier," "jam," "bridge too far."

I'll structure the summary to mention the warning from Summers, the criticism from Democrats, the provisions that benefit the wealthy, the attempts to block the bill, and the internal conflict within the Democratic party. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to preserve the author's tone.

**SUMMARY:**
Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned that failing to pass a tax cut compromise could increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The deal, criticized by liberal Democrats for giving away too much to the wealthy, extends tax cuts for both the middle class and higher earners. Some Democrats are unhappy, accusing the administration of rubber-stamping deals that favor the rich. Senate Democrats requested changes to the bill, while House Democrats, led by Reps. DeFazio, McDermott, and Inslee, are crafting a letter to block the bill, arguing it should not proceed without majority support. Pelosi called the estate tax provision "a bridge too far," reflecting internal conflict within the Democratic party. Obama urged lawmakers to pass the deal, citing economic benefits, but House Democrats remain resistant. END OF SUMMARY.
