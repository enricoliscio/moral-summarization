Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally framed words as possible. The words given are "beyond," "following," "crossed," "take," "bias," "federal," "refuse," and "pretense." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Ruth Bader Ginsburg made comments about Donald Trump potentially becoming president, expressing concern about his impact on the country and the Supreme Court. Some legal academics are questioning her impartiality because of these statements, suggesting she might need to recuse herself from cases involving Trump. There's a debate about judicial ethics and whether judges should be seen as nonpartisan. The author uses terms like "beyond the pale," "crossed a line," and "pretense" to frame the issue morally.

I need to make sure the summary includes these terms. I'll start by mentioning Ginsburg's comments and the concern they've raised. Then, I'll note the academics' arguments about her impartiality and the suggestion for recusal. I should include terms like "crossed a line" and "bias." Also, I need to mention the debate over judicial ethics and the "pretense" of nonpartisanship.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while including all the key points and the specified moral terms. I'll structure it by first introducing Ginsburg's statements, then the reactions from academics, and finally the broader debate about judicial impartiality.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each key point is covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has sparked controversy with her candid remarks about Donald Trump potentially becoming president, expressing concern about his impact on the country and the court. Legal academics argue her comments could raise questions about her impartiality, suggesting she might need to recuse herself from Trump-related cases. Some, like Josh Blackman, claim her statements are "beyond the pale" and could harm the court's integrity. Dmitry Bam notes she has "crossed a line," creating the "appearance of bias." Federal law requires justices to recuse themselves if their impartiality is "reasonably questioned," though such recusals for political reasons are rare. Critics, including Ed Whelan, argue no justice has previously commented on presidential candidates' merits, making Ginsburg's remarks unusual. However, others, like Bam, argue judges are influenced by personal beliefs and experiences, questioning the "pretense" of judicial nonpartisanship. The debate highlights tensions between judicial ethics and political reality. END OF SUMMARY.
