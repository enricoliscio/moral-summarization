SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent comments about a potential Donald Trump presidency have raised questions about her candor and the court's integrity. Ginsburg's remarks, in which she joked about moving to New Zealand if Trump were elected, have been deemed "beyond the pale" by some legal academics and Supreme Court observers. Her comments have led to concerns about her impartiality and whether she should recuse herself from considering any Trump-related cases that reach the high court. Many argue that Ginsburg has crossed a line and created the appearance of bias, which could lead a "reasonable person" to question her impartiality. Under federal law, justices must step aside from cases where their "impartiality might reasonably be questioned." Ginsburg's actions have sparked a debate about the importance of judges being candid about their positions and biases, and whether the political process has done away with the veneer that the high court is entirely apolitical.

END OF SUMMARY.
