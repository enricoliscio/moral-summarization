Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. The user mentioned that these should be listed in STEP 1, each on a new line starting with a *. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "shy," "prospect," "joking," "couldn’t," "imagine," "country," "presidency," "Trump," "four," "court," "contemplate," "Democrats," "Clinton," "appointments," "candor," "integrity," "recuse," "intervention," "funny," "beyond," "pale," "impartiality," "legitimate," "question," "recusals," "ethics," "apolitical," "impropriety," "salience," "indiscretions," "pretense," "nonpartisan," "harm," "good." These words seem to carry some moral weight in the context of the article.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and should capture the main points of the article. The article talks about Justice Ginsburg's comments about Trump, the reactions from legal academics, the discussion about recusal, and the broader implications about the court's impartiality.

I'll start by mentioning Ginsburg's comments and the reactions, then move on to the discussions about recusal and the court's integrity. I'll also touch on the debate about whether judges should be seen as apolitical or if that's a pretense that's harmful.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes the key points without getting too bogged down in details. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. Also, I'll make sure to use the morally framed words where appropriate to preserve the author's framing.

Finally, I'll structure the summary after the "SUMMARY:" token and end it with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise.

**SUMMARY:**  
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has sparked controversy with her candid remarks about the possibility of Donald Trump becoming president, joking she might move to New Zealand if he wins. Her comments, which expressed concern about Trump’s potential impact on the country and the court, have raised questions about her impartiality and whether she should recuse herself from any Trump-related cases. Legal scholars and observers argue that her statements create the appearance of bias, potentially undermining the court’s integrity. Some suggest she should step down or remain silent, while others defend her right to express her views. The debate highlights the tension between judicial ethics and the reality of the court’s political nature, with some arguing that the pretense of apathy does more harm than good. END OF SUMMARY.
