SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has made comments about her lack of support for a potential Donald Trump presidency, stating that she would rather move to New Zealand than live in a country with Trump as president. Ginsburg's candor has raised questions about the propriety of her comments and their potential impact on the court's integrity. Legal academics and Supreme Court observers, such as Josh Blackman and Rick Hasen, suggest that Ginsburg's comments could lead a reasonable person to question her impartiality in future politically charged cases. Dmitry Bam, a professor at the University of Maine School of Law, stated that Ginsburg's comments create the appearance that justices take sides in elections and that she should recuse herself from any Trump-related cases that reach the high court. However, recusals for political views are rare, and other justices have declined to step aside in politically salient cases in the past. The article also raises the question of whether it is more important for judges to be candid about their biases, given that the political process has already made clear the political nature of the court. Bam suggests that the pretense of nonpartisanship and apolitical nature of judges may do more harm than good. Ginsburg's comments and the potential ethical implications they raise are a subject of debate among legal scholars and court observers.
