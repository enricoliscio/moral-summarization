Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg making comments about Donald Trump becoming president, and the reactions to her candor. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Ginsburg made jokes about moving to New Zealand if Trump becomes president and expressed concern about his impact on the court. Legal scholars and observers are questioning whether her comments are appropriate and if she should recuse herself from any Trump-related cases. Some argue that her candor could affect the court's integrity, while others point out that political bias in the judiciary is more common than it seems.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: candor, tell, comments, lead, crossed, take, participates, avoid, declined, step, took, recuse, indiscretions. I should include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I'll structure the summary by first stating Ginsburg's comments and the concern they raised. Then, mention the reactions from legal scholars about her candor and the potential need for recusal. I'll also include the debate about whether the court is truly apolitical and the implications of her statements on judicial ethics.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it flows well. I'll start by introducing Ginsburg's comments, then the scholars' concerns, and end with the broader debate about judicial impartiality.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring I include the key points and the moral framing words. I'll check the word count to stay within limits.

SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has expressed concerns about a Donald Trump presidency, joking she might move to New Zealand. Her candor, including comments about Trump's potential impact on the court, has sparked debate. Legal scholars argue her remarks could lead to questions about her impartiality, suggesting she might need to recuse herself from Trump-related cases. Critics, like Josh Blackman, claim her comments have crossed a line, while others, such as Dmitry Bam, argue that the court's political nature is undeniable. The article highlights the tension between judicial ethics and the reality of political influence, with Bam noting that the pretense of nonpartisanship may be harmful. Ginsburg's indiscretions raise questions about whether judges should avoid overt bias or embrace transparency. END OF SUMMARY.
