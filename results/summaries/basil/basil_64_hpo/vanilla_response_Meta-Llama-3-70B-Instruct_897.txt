SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been vocal about her disapproval of Donald Trump as a potential president, joking about moving to New Zealand if he wins. Her comments have raised concerns among legal academics and Supreme Court observers about the propriety of her candor and the potential impact on the court's integrity. Some argue that she may need to recuse herself from considering any Trump-related cases that reach the high court. Critics argue that her statements could lead a "reasonable person" to question her impartiality in a future politically charged case. Under federal law, justices must step aside from cases where their "impartiality might reasonably be questioned." While recusals for political views are rare, some argue that Ginsburg's comments have crossed a line and created the appearance of bias.

END OF SUMMARY.
