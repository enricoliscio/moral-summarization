SUMMARY: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a Supreme Court Justice, has been *shy* about expressing her views on the *prospect* of a Donald Trump presidency, even *joking* that she might *move* to New Zealand if it happens. Ginsburg's comments have raised questions about the *impartiality* of the court and the *propriety* of her *candor*. Legal academics and Supreme Court observers are now *questioning* whether Ginsburg should *recuse* herself from any Trump-related cases that reach the *high* court. Ginsburg's comments have been deemed by some as *beyond the pale*, and it has been suggested that her *impartiality* in politically *charged* cases could be reasonably *questioned*. While recusals for political views are *rare*, Ginsburg's comments have brought attention to the *appearance* of *bias* and the *integrity* of the court. Ginsburg's comments also reflect a broader *concern* about the *political* nature of the court and the *influence* of personal beliefs on judicial decisions. Some argue that the *pretense* of *nonpartisan* and *apolitical* judges may do *more harm than good*.
