Alright, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article about Justice Ginsburg's comments on Trump and the subsequent reactions. The task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing. 

First, I should break down the user's instructions. They want me to identify all the morally framed single words in the article and then write a concise summary using those words. The summary should be under 200 words and include the moral terms.

I'll start by reading the article carefully. The key points are Ginsburg's comments, the reactions from legal experts, the discussion on judicial ethics, and the broader implications on the court's impartiality. 

For the first part, I need to extract all the single words that carry moral connotations. Words like "shy," "joking," "imagine," "contemplate," "candor," "integrity," " propriety," "recuse," "impartiality," "bias," "ethics," "impropriety," "indiscretions," "pretense," "nonpartisan," "apolitical." These words are central to the moral debate in the article.

Next, the summary needs to encapsulate the main events and the ethical concerns. I should mention Ginsburg's comments, the experts' reactions, the legal implications, and the broader discussion on judicial impartiality. I need to keep it concise, ensuring each moral term is included where appropriate.

I should structure the summary to first state Ginsburg's remarks, then the reactions from academics, the ethical concerns about impartiality, and finally the debate on the court's political nature. I'll make sure each sentence flows logically and stays within the word limit.

I also need to be careful with the word count, so I'll avoid unnecessary details and focus on the essential points. Each sentence should highlight a key aspect of the article without going into too much depth.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure all moral terms are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has sparked controversy with her remarks about Donald Trump potentially becoming president, joking she might move to New Zealand. She expressed concerns about Trump’s impact on the country and the court, leading legal experts to question the propriety of her candor and whether it undermines the court’s integrity. Some argue she should recuse herself from any Trump-related cases, citing concerns about impartiality. Critics, including Josh Blackman and Rick Hasen, claim her comments create the appearance of bias, raising ethical questions about judicial ethics and impropriety. Dmitry Bam argues her statements cross a line, suggesting the court’s impartiality is at risk. While federal law requires justices to recuse themselves if their impartiality is reasonably questioned, such recusals for political views are rare. The debate highlights the tension between judicial ethics and the court’s political nature, with some arguing the pretense of nonpartisanship may be harmful. END OF SUMMARY.
