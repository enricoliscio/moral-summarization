SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has made recent comments expressing her concerns about a potential Donald Trump presidency, stating that she "can't imagine" a Trump-led country and joking that she would move to New Zealand if he were elected. These comments have raised questions among legal academics and Supreme Court observers about the propriety of Ginsburg's candor and potential implications for the court's integrity. Some suggest that Ginsburg's impartiality could be questioned in future politically charged cases, particularly if Trump v. Clinton arises in the fall. While recusals for political views are rare, some believe Ginsburg may have crossed a line and that her participation in Trump-related cases could create an appearance of bias. This incident highlights ongoing debates about the political nature of the court and the pretense of nonpartisanship among judges. 

END OF SUMMARY.
