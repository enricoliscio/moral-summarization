SUMMARY:
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent comments about a potential Donald Trump presidency have raised questions about her candor and the court's integrity. Her jokes about moving to New Zealand if Trump becomes president have been seen as beyond the pale by some legal academics and Supreme Court observers. They argue that her comments could lead a reasonable person to question her impartiality in a future politically charged case. Ginsburg's statements have created the appearance that justices take sides in elections, which could compromise the court's integrity. Some experts believe she may need to recuse herself from considering any Trump-related case that reaches the high court. The episode has sparked a debate about whether judges should be candid about their positions and biases, and whether the political process has done away with the veneer that the high court is entirely apolitical.
