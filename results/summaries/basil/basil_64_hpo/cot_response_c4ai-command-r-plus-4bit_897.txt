SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been vocal about her concerns regarding a potential Donald Trump presidency, even joking about moving to New Zealand if he were to be elected. Ginsburg's comments have raised questions about the propriety of her candor and the integrity of the court. Legal academics and Supreme Court observers are suggesting that Ginsburg might need to recuse herself from any Trump-related cases that reach the high court due to the appearance of bias. Ginsburg's remarks are being questioned from an ethical standpoint, as they could reasonably call into question her impartiality. This situation highlights the increasingly blurred lines between politics and the judiciary, with some suggesting that the pretense of nonpartisanship and apolitical nature of the court may be doing more harm than good. END OF SUMMARY.
