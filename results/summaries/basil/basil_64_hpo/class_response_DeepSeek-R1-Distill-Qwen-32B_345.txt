Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's comments on a potential Trump presidency. She made jokes about moving to New Zealand and expressed concerns about Trump's impact on the country and the court. Some legal experts are questioning her impartiality and suggesting she might need to recuse herself in future cases involving Trump.

The author used specific morally framed words: "beyond," "following," "crossed," "take," "bias," "federal," "refuse," "pretense." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should start by mentioning Ginsburg's comments and the concerns raised. Then, touch on the experts' reactions, the federal law on recusals, and the debate about judicial impartiality. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the key moral terms.

Let me structure it: Ginsburg's statements, experts' concerns about impartiality, mention of federal law, recusals, and the debate on judicial bias and pretense of nonpartisanship.

I'll make sure to include each of the moral words where appropriate. For example, "crossed a line," "bias," "federal law," "refuse," "pretense." 

I should also mention the broader debate about whether judges should be candid about their biases, acknowledging that the court's political nature is sometimes exposed.

Now, putting it all together in a clear, concise summary while keeping the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has sparked controversy by openly expressing concerns about a Donald Trump presidency, joking about relocating to New Zealand and questioning the court’s integrity under his potential leadership. Legal experts argue her comments may create the appearance of bias, suggesting she might need to recuse herself from future Trump-related cases. Federal law requires justices to step aside if their impartiality is reasonably questioned, though recusals based on political views are rare. Ginsburg’s remarks have crossed a line, according to some, raising ethical concerns about judicial impartiality. Critics, like Josh Blackman, argue her comments are “beyond the pale,” while others, such as Dmitry Bam, suggest her statements could lead a reasonable person to question her bias. The debate highlights the tension between judicial ethics and the reality of political influence in the court. Some argue the pretense of judicial nonpartisanship does more harm than good, given the court’s often partisan decisions and the political nature of judicial appointments. END OF SUMMARY.
