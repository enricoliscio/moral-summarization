Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's comments on Donald Trump. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, so I have to be efficient.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Ginsburg made jokes about moving to New Zealand if Trump becomes president and expressed concerns about his impact on the court. Some legal experts are questioning her impartiality and suggesting she might need to recuse herself if a Trump-related case comes up.

I should note the reactions from different people: Josh Blackman thinks she should be quiet or step down, Rick Hasen says her statements could make people question her impartiality, and Dmitry Bam believes she's crossed a line. There's also mention of federal law requiring justices to recuse if their impartiality is in question, but such cases are rare.

Additionally, the article discusses the broader issue of whether judges should be seen as apolitical. Some argue that the court's political nature is already evident, so Ginsburg's comments might not be that unusual.

I need to structure this into a clear, concise summary. Start with Ginsburg's comments, then the reactions, and finally the debate about judicial impartiality. Keep it under 200 words and make sure it's all captured accurately without going into too much detail.

I'll make sure to include the key points: her statements, the experts' concerns about impartiality, the rarity of recusals for political reasons, and the debate on whether judges should be seen as nonpartisan.

Let me put this together in a logical flow, ensuring each sentence adds value and stays within the word limit. I'll avoid any unnecessary details to keep it tight.
