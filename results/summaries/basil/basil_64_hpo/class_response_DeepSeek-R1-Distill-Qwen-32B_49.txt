Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the specific words they want me to include. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg making comments about Donald Trump becoming president. She expressed concern and even joked about moving to New Zealand. Legal experts are questioning if her comments compromised the court's integrity and if she should recuse herself in any Trump-related cases. Some argue that her statements show bias, while others point out that judges are influenced by personal beliefs and the court isn't entirely apolitical.

The user wants a summary that includes the words: beyond, following, crossed, take, bias, federal, refuse, pretense. I need to make sure these words are incorporated naturally.

I should start by mentioning Ginsburg's comments and the experts' reactions. Then, address the moral implications like crossing a line, bias, and federal law on recusals. Also, include the debate about the court's apolitical pretense and refusal to recuse in politically charged cases.

I need to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly. Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each moral word is included without forcing them. Make sure the summary flows logically and covers all key points from the article.

SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has sparked controversy with her candid remarks about the possibility of Donald Trump becoming president, joking she might move to New Zealand. Legal experts argue her comments could create the appearance of bias, questioning her impartiality if Trump-related cases come before the court. Federal law requires justices to recuse themselves if their impartiality is reasonably questioned, though such recusals for political views are rare. Ginsburg’s statements have crossed a line, some say, as they may lead reasonable people to doubt her fairness. Critics, including Josh Blackman and Dmitry Bam, suggest her comments are beyond the pale and could harm the court’s integrity. Bam argues that the court’s pretense of nonpartisanship is increasingly challenged, given judges’ personal biases and political influences. The debate raises questions about whether judges should remain silent on political matters or acknowledge their biases openly. END OF SUMMARY.
