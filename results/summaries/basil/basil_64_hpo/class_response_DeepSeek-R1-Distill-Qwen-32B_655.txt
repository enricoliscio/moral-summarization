Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the text and the specific morally framed words to include. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's comments on Donald Trump becoming president. She jokes about moving to New Zealand and expresses concern about his presidency, especially regarding the court. Some legal experts are questioning her impartiality, suggesting she might need to recuse herself if Trump-related cases come before the court. They argue her comments could create an appearance of bias.

The author used words like "beyond," "following," "crossed," "take," "bias," "federal," "refuse," "pretense." I need to include these in the summary. I should keep the summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll start by mentioning Ginsburg's comments and the concerns raised. Then, include the experts' opinions and the moral implications. Make sure to use the specified words. I'll need to be concise but cover all key points: her statements, the experts' reactions, the ethical concerns, and the broader context about judicial impartiality.

Let me structure it: Ginsburg's comments, experts' criticism, the federal law on recusal, and the debate over judicial bias and pretense. I'll make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate.

Double-checking the word count to ensure it's under 200. Also, ensuring the summary flows logically and maintains the moral framing as per the article.

SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has sparked controversy with her candid remarks about Donald Trump potentially becoming president, joking she might move to New Zealand and expressing concern about his impact on the country and the court. Legal academics and observers have questioned the propriety of her comments, suggesting she may need to recuse herself from any Trump-related cases due to the appearance of bias. Federal law requires justices to step aside if their impartiality could be reasonably questioned, though recusals based on political views are rare. Critics argue her comments cross a line, creating the appearance of partisanship. Others, however, argue that the pretense of judicial impartiality is increasingly untenable, given the court's political nature. The debate raises ethical concerns about whether judges should remain silent on political issues or acknowledge their biases openly. END OF SUMMARY.
