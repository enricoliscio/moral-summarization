Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the content. The article is about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg making comments about Donald Trump becoming president, and the subsequent reactions from legal experts and ethicists.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "shy," "joking," "imagine," "contemplate," "propriety," "integrity," "candidness," "recuse," "impartiality," "bias," "ethics," "nonpartisan," "apolitical," and "impropriety" come to mind. These words are used in a moral context, reflecting on Ginsburg's actions and their implications on the court's integrity.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of the article. I'll start by mentioning Ginsburg's comments about Trump, then the concerns about her impartiality, the calls for recusal, and the debate over judicial ethics and the court's political nature.

I should ensure that the summary flows well and includes all key points: Ginsburg's remarks, the legal experts' reactions, the ethical concerns, and the broader discussion about the court's impartiality. I'll make sure to use the identified morally framed words to maintain the original moral framing of the article.

Now, putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to first introduce Ginsburg's comments, then discuss the ethical implications, mention the calls for recusal, and conclude with the debate on judicial impartiality versus political reality. This should cover all necessary points while adhering to the word limit and preserving the moral elements.

**SUMMARY:**  
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has sparked controversy with her remarks about the possibility of Donald Trump becoming president, joking she might move to New Zealand. She expressed concerns about Trump’s potential impact on the country and the court, leading some legal experts to question her impartiality and suggest she might need to recuse herself from future Trump-related cases. Critics argue her comments create the appearance of bias, raising ethical concerns about judicial integrity. While federal law requires justices to step aside if their impartiality is reasonably questioned, recusals based on political views are rare. Some argue that Ginsburg’s comments are beyond the pale, while others suggest the court’s supposed nonpartisanship is a veneer, given its political nature. The debate highlights tensions between judicial ethics and the reality of the court’s political influence. END OF SUMMARY.
