SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's candor about a potential Donald Trump presidency has raised questions about the court's integrity. Her comments, which some deem "beyond the pale," have led legal academics and Supreme Court observers to suggest she might need to recuse herself from considering any Trump-related case. Ginsburg's remarks have crossed a line, creating the appearance that justices take sides in elections. Under federal law, justices must step aside from cases where their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. While recusals for political views are rare, Ginsburg's comments have led some to question her impartiality. Others argue that the political process has done away with the veneer that the high court is entirely apolitical, and that perhaps the pretense that judges are nonpartisan and apolitical does more harm than good. Ginsburg's actions have sparked a debate about the ethics of judicial candor and the need for judges to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.

END OF SUMMARY.
