SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has made comments in recent interviews expressing her concerns about a potential Donald Trump presidency, stating that she "can't imagine" a Trump-led country and joking that she might move to New Zealand if he is elected. Legal academics and Supreme Court observers are now questioning the propriety and impartiality of Ginsburg's candor, with some suggesting that she may have to recuse herself from any Trump-related cases that reach the high court. Critics argue that Ginsburg's comments "crossed a line" and create the appearance of bias and partisanship within the court. However, others argue that judges should be candid about their positions and biases, as the political process has already exposed the court's political nature. The debate raises ethical concerns about the integrity and impartiality of the Supreme Court, with some calling for Ginsburg to be quiet or step down.
