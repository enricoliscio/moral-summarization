SUMMARY:
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent comments about a potential Donald Trump presidency have raised questions about her propriety and the court's integrity. Her candor about not wanting to contemplate a Trump presidency has led some legal academics to suggest she might have to recuse herself from considering any Trump-related case. Critics argue that her comments have crossed a line, creating the appearance of bias and undermining the court's impartiality. While some argue that Ginsburg's comments are beyond the pale, others see this as an opportunity to acknowledge that judges are not apolitical and that the political process has done away with the pretense of an entirely apolitical high court. The ethics concerns surrounding Ginsburg's comments have sparked a debate about the role of judges in the political process. END OF SUMMARY.
