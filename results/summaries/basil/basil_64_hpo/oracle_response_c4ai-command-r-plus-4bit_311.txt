SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has made comments about her concerns regarding a potential Donald Trump presidency, stating that she would consider moving to New Zealand if he were to become president. Ginsburg's candor has raised questions about the propriety of her statements and their potential impact on the court's integrity. Legal academics and Supreme Court observers, such as Josh Blackman and Rick Hasen, suggest that Ginsburg's comments could lead a "reasonable person" to question her impartiality in future politically charged cases. Dmitry Bam, a professor at the University of Maine School of Law, agrees that Ginsburg has "crossed a line" and that her participation in any Trump-related cases that reach the high court could create an appearance of bias. Under federal law, justices must step aside from cases where their "impartiality might reasonably be questioned." While recusals for political views are rare, some believe that Ginsburg's comments may require her to recuse herself from future Trump-related cases. Others, like Ed Whelan, acknowledge that while Ginsburg's comments may be unethical, they also reflect the reality that judges are influenced by their personal beliefs and experiences. This raises the question of whether the pretense of nonpartisanship and apolitical nature of the court does more harm than good. END OF SUMMARY.
