SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has made recent comments expressing her concerns about a potential Donald Trump presidency, stating that she "can't imagine" a Trump-led country and joking that she would move to New Zealand if he were elected. These statements have raised questions about the propriety of her candor and potential bias. Legal scholars and Supreme Court observers are discussing the possibility of Ginsburg having to recuse herself from any Trump-related cases that reach the high court due to the appearance of bias. While recusals for political views are rare, some believe Ginsburg's comments have crossed a line and could impact the court's integrity. However, others argue that the political process has already exposed the high court's political nature, and that judges' candid expressions of their biases may be beneficial. This incident highlights ongoing debates about judicial ethics, impartiality, and the political nature of the Supreme Court.
