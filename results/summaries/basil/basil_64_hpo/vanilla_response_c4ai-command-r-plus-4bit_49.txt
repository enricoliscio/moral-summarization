SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has made headlines with her recent comments about a potential Donald Trump presidency, stating that she "can't imagine" a Trump presidency and joking that she would move to New Zealand if he were elected. Ginsburg's remarks have raised questions about the propriety of her candor and the potential impact on the court's integrity. Legal academics and Supreme Court observers are discussing the possibility of Ginsburg having to recuse herself from any Trump-related cases that reach the high court. Some experts argue that Ginsburg's comments create an appearance of bias and could lead a reasonable person to question her impartiality. This situation highlights the challenges of maintaining the appearance of impartiality and nonpartisanship in the Supreme Court, especially in the current highly politicized environment.
