SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent comments about Donald Trump's presidency have raised questions about her candor and the court's integrity. Her jokes about moving to New Zealand if Trump wins and her reluctance to consider him as a potential appointer-in-chief have led some legal academics and Supreme Court observers to suggest that she may have to recuse herself from considering any Trump-related case. Critics argue that her comments have crossed a line, creating the appearance of bias and undermining the court's impartiality. Some argue that her candor, while refreshing, may have gone too far, and that she should have avoided making such comments to maintain the appearance of impartiality. Others see this as an opportunity to acknowledge that judges are not entirely apolitical and that the political process itself has done away with the veneer of the high court's impartiality. END OF SUMMARY.
