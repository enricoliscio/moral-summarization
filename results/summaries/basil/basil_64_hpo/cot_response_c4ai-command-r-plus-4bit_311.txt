SUMMARY:
Some legal academics and Supreme Court observers are questioning the propriety of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's candor about the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, suggesting that she might have to recuse herself from considering any Trump-related cases that reach the high court. Ginsburg has joked that she would move to New Zealand if Trump were to become president, and has stated that she cannot imagine what the country would be like under his leadership. While some, like Houston College of Law professor Josh Blackman, argue that Ginsburg's comments are beyond the pale and reflect a lack of impartiality, others acknowledge that the political nature of the court and the influence of personal beliefs on judicial decisions have become increasingly apparent. The question remains whether Ginsburg's comments are improper or simply a reflection of the current political climate and the desire for judicial candidness.
