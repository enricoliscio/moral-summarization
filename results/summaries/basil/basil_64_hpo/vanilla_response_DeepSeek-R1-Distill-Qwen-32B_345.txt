Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg making comments about Donald Trump potentially becoming president. She jokes about moving to New Zealand and expresses concern about Trump's presidency affecting the country and the court. She also mentions not wanting to think about Trump appointing justices. 

Some legal experts are questioning her comments, suggesting she might need to recuse herself from any Trump-related cases. They argue her statements could make her appear biased. The article mentions federal law requiring justices to step aside if their impartiality is in question, but such recusals are rare, especially for political reasons. 

There's a debate here: one side says her comments are unethical, the other argues that judges are inherently political and that the court's supposed impartiality is a facade. The article ends by noting that Ginsburg's comments have sparked a broader discussion about judicial ethics and the political nature of the Supreme Court.

I should condense this into a concise summary, highlighting Ginsburg's comments, the reactions from experts, the debate on ethics versus political reality, and the implications for the court's integrity. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has sparked controversy by openly expressing concerns about a Donald Trump presidency, joking she might move to New Zealand if he becomes president. She also declined to comment on Trump's potential appointments to the court. Legal experts and court observers have criticized her candor, suggesting it could undermine the court's impartiality and questioning whether she should recuse herself from any Trump-related cases. Federal law requires justices to step aside if their impartiality is reasonably questioned, though such recusals are rare, especially for political reasons. Some argue Ginsburg's comments cross a line, while others contend judges are inherently influenced by personal beliefs and the court's supposed nonpartisanship is a myth. The debate highlights tensions between judicial ethics and the political nature of the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
