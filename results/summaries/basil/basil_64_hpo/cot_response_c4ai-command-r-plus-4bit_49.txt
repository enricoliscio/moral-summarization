SUMMARY: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a Supreme Court Justice, has been rather shy about expressing her concerns regarding the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, joking that she might move to New Zealand if it were to happen. Ginsburg's comments have raised questions about the propriety of her candor and what it could mean for the court's integrity. Legal academics and Supreme Court observers are suggesting that Ginsburg might have to recuse herself from considering any Trump-related cases that reach the high court. The issue at hand is whether Ginsburg's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, as required by federal law in certain cases. While recusals for political views are exceedingly rare, some believe Ginsburg has crossed a line and that her comments create an appearance of bias. This situation highlights the tension between wanting judges to be candid about their biases and the desire to maintain the veneer of an entirely apolitical court. It raises questions about the role of personal beliefs and experiences in judicial decision-making and the potential harm caused by pretending that judges are nonpartisan.
