SUMMARY:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent comments about a potential Donald Trump presidency have sparked controversy, with some legal academics and Supreme Court observers questioning her candor and the court's integrity. Ginsburg's remarks, in which she joked about moving to New Zealand if Trump were elected, have been deemed "beyond the pale" by some, who argue that she has crossed a line and may need to recuse herself from considering any Trump-related cases. Her comments, they argue, create the appearance of bias and undermine the court's impartiality. While Ginsburg's supporters may share her concerns about Trump, the ethics concerns don't depend on the soundness of the candidate. The incident has raised questions about the propriety of judges' comments and the political nature of the court, with some arguing that the pretense of judges being nonpartisan and apolitical does more harm than good.
