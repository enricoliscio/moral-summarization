SUMMARY: Ginsburg has been less than shy about her views on the prospect of a Trump presidency, joking that she might move to New Zealand if he were to win. She has commented on the merits and demerits of a presidential candidate, noting that she would prefer to have Hillary Clinton making Supreme Court appointments. Legal academics and Supreme Court observers are now questioning the propriety of Ginsburg's candor and whether it calls into question her impartiality in future cases related to the Trump campaign. There are concerns that Ginsburg's comments create an appearance of bias and that she may have to recuse herself from any Trump-related cases that reach the high court. While recusals for political views are exceedingly rare, some believe Ginsburg's comments cross a line and could harm the veneer that the court is apolitical. However, others argue that judges should be candid about their positions and biases, recognizing that personal beliefs and experiences heavily influence judicial decisions. This raises ethical concerns, as judges are expected to be nonpartisan and apolitical, but the political nature of the court is already evident in its decisions and the partisan politics that influence the nomination process. END OF SUMMARY.
