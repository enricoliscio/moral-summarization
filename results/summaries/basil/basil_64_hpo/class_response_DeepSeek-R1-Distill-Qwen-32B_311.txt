Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Justice Ginsburg's comments on Trump and the subsequent reactions. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing, using specific words they've highlighted. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning Ginsburg's jokes about moving to New Zealand if Trump becomes president, indicating her strong opposition. She's made similar comments in interviews, suggesting she prefers Clinton. Legal experts are questioning her candor, arguing it might affect the court's integrity. Some suggest she should recuse herself if Trump-related cases come up. Professors like Josh Blackman and Rick Hasen are critical, saying her comments could make her appear biased. Federal law requires justices to recuse if their impartiality is questioned, but such cases are rare, especially for political reasons.

The article also touches on the broader debate about judicial impartiality versus the reality of political influences. Ginsburg's comments have sparked discussions about whether judges should be candid about their biases, given the court's political nature. Experts like Bam argue that the pretense of nonpartisanship might be harmful.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary, keeping the morally framed words: "beyond," "following," "crossed," "take," "bias," "federal," "refuse," "pretense." I'll make sure to include these where appropriate.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Ginsburg's comments, then the experts' reactions, the federal law on recusal, and the broader debate about judicial impartiality. I'll keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered concisely while preserving the moral framing. I'll check that all the required words are included naturally within the summary.

SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has made remarks expressing strong opposition to a Donald Trump presidency, joking she might move to New Zealand if he were elected. Her comments, including concerns about Trump's potential impact on the court, have sparked debate about judicial ethics and impartiality. Legal scholars argue her candor may create the appearance of bias, suggesting she could face recusal in future Trump-related cases. Federal law mandates justices recuse themselves if their impartiality is reasonably questioned, though such instances are rare. Critics, like Josh Blackman and Rick Hasen, claim Ginsburg has crossed a line, questioning her ability to remain unbiased. Dmitry Bam argues her statements undermine the court's pretense of nonpartisanship, highlighting the tension between judicial candor and the appearance of impartiality. The broader debate centers on whether judges should acknowledge their biases or maintain the facade of political neutrality, given the court's inherently political nature. END OF SUMMARY.
