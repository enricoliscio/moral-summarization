SUMMARY: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has sparked controversy with her recent comments about a potential Donald Trump presidency, joking that she would move to New Zealand if he were elected. Legal academics and Supreme Court observers are now questioning the propriety of Ginsburg's candor and its potential impact on the court's integrity. Some suggest that she may have to recuse herself from any Trump-related cases that reach the high court due to the appearance of bias. While recusals for political views are rare, Ginsburg's comments have crossed a line for some, with one professor stating that "this isn't funny anymore." The article also highlights the ongoing debate about the political nature of the court and the pretense of nonpartisanship and apolitical nature of judges. Ginsburg's comments have brought these issues to the forefront once again.
