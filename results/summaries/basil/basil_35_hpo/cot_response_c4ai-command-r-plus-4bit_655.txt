SUMMARY:
Amid charges of a cover-up and enduring criticism over the handling of the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, the White House released 100 pages of emails on Wednesday, detailing the development of talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice. The emails reveal that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple government agencies and not solely by the State Department, as previously alleged by Republican lawmakers. Despite enduring scrutiny and demands for more information, the White House has maintained that their interactions were focused on providing facts based on the best available information while protecting an ongoing investigation. Critics, however, continue to allege political motivations behind the changes, suggesting that the State Department was attempting to ignore warnings and protect its reputation as being tough on terrorism. The release of the emails has sparked further debate, with some seeing it as an admission of wrongdoing by the administration and others hoping it will put an end to the controversial Benghazi issue.
