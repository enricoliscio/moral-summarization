Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so they want the summary to reflect the original's moral perspective.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the release of emails regarding the Benghazi attack talking points. The White House is responding to Republican claims of a cover-up. The emails show that multiple agencies, not just the State Department, were involved in changing the talking points. The key moral words used are things like "attack," "charges," "theories," "portrayed," "attempting," "alter," "ignored," etc.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by identifying the main events: the release of emails, the context of the Benghazi attack, the claims of a cover-up, the findings in the emails, and the reactions from both the administration and critics.

I should structure the summary to first mention the release and its purpose, then the content of the emails showing multiple agencies' involvement, the specific changes made (like removing al Qaeda references), the reasons behind these changes (accuracy, investigation), and the political implications. Finally, I'll note the administration's hope that this ends the issue and the critics' reactions.

I need to ensure that the moral framing is preserved, so words like "charges," "theories," "ignored," "abused," "assault," "demonstrations," "willing," "accommodate," etc., are included where appropriate. I'll avoid adding any new moral terms not in the original.

I'll also keep the summary clear and factual, making sure it's within the word limit. I'll check for any key points I might have missed, like the CIA's internal review and the timing of the document release, which raises questions about the administration's motives.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, covering the release, the content of the emails, the reactions, and the implications. I'll make sure each sentence is concise and includes the necessary moral language without overcomplicating the summary.

SUMMARY: The White House released emails related to the development of talking points about the 2012 Benghazi attack, addressing Republican charges of a political "cover-up." The emails show that multiple agencies, including the CIA, influenced changes to the talking points, contrary to theories of political manipulation. Critics argue that the State Department, particularly Victoria Nuland, sought to alter the talking points to avoid criticism and protect its image. However, senior officials emphasized that such changes, like removing references to al Qaeda, were made at the CIA's request to avoid prejudicing the FBI investigation. The CIA's internal review confirmed that changes were driven by concerns about accuracy and the investigation, not political motives. The document release aimed to clarify the process and refute claims of a cover-up, though critics remain skeptical. The timing of the release raised questions about the administration's willingness to accommodate demands for transparency. The emails confirm that the interagency process focused on providing factual information while protecting the investigation, but critics argue the changes reflect a political intent to avoid criticism. END OF SUMMARY.
