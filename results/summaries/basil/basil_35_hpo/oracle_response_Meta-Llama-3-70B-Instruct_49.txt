SUMMARY:

The White House has released a set of emails surrounding the development of talking points on the 2012 Benghazi attack, in response to ongoing charges of a political "cover-up" from congressional Republicans. The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points. Critics had argued that the State Department and White House attempted to alter the talking points for political reasons, ignoring suggestions and language from the CIA. However, senior administration officials stressed that language referencing al Qaeda was removed at the CIA's request. The emails also reveal that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland and CIA deputy director Michael J. Morell both wanted to remove a line referencing previous security warnings, citing concerns about accuracy and professionalism. The release of the emails aims to put to rest theories of a political cover-up, with the White House hoping to move on from the Benghazi issue and focus on protecting those serving overseas.
