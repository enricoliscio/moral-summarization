Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, and I need to make sure those are included in the summary. The summary should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the release of emails related to the Benghazi attack talking points. Republicans accused the Obama administration of a political cover-up. The emails show that multiple agencies, not just the State Department, were involved in changing the talking points. The article mentions that references to al Qaeda were removed, but it was at the CIA's request. There's also criticism about the State Department trying to protect its image. The White House released the emails to counter the cover-up theories, but critics argue that the changes were politically motivated. The timing of the release is questioned, and the White House hopes this will end the Benghazi issue.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the article: attack, charges, theories, portrayed, attempting, alter, ignored, attacks, abused, beat, assault, demonstrations, willing, accommodate, avoid, ignoring, statements, changed, selectively, inaccurately, read, providing, protecting, working, protected.

I should incorporate as many of these as possible without making the summary too long. I'll structure the summary to cover the release of emails, the accusations, the involvement of multiple agencies, the removal of al Qaeda references, the State Department's image concerns, the CIA's role, the White House's response, and the ongoing criticism.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the key points and the moral terms. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words.

I think I've covered all the necessary elements. Now, I'll present the summary as per the user's instructions.

SUMMARY: The White House released emails regarding the Obama administration's development of talking points about the 2012 Benghazi attack, amid Republican charges of a political cover-up. The emails show multiple agencies, including the CIA, influenced changes to the talking points, contrary to theories that the State Department alone altered them for political gain. Critics accused the State Department of trying to avoid criticism by removing references to al Qaeda and previous warnings, but officials claimed these changes were made at the CIA's request to avoid prejudicing the FBI investigation. The release of emails aimed to counter claims of a political motive, yet critics argue the State Department's actions reflect an attempt to protect its image. The timing of the document dump raised questions, with some suggesting it accommodated congressional demands. The White House hopes the release will resolve the Benghazi issue, emphasizing a focus on protecting U.S. personnel abroad. END OF SUMMARY.
