Okay, so I need to help this user who's asking me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to first identify all the morally framed single words in the article. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about the release of emails related to the Benghazi attack talking points. The White House is responding to Republican claims of a cover-up. The key here is that the user wants a summary that keeps the moral aspects, so I need to focus on words that carry a moral connotation.

Step 1 is to identify those single words. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "cover-up," "ignored," "abused," "concerned," "premature," "manipulate," "misleading," "selectively," "inaccurately," "motivations," "criticized," "questioned," "contradicted," "extraordinary," "protecting," "better protected." These words carry moral weight, indicating actions that are right or wrong, or intentions that are good or bad.

Next, for the summary, I need to make sure I include as many of these words as possible without making it too long. I should keep it under 200 words. The summary should reflect that the emails were released to counter claims of a cover-up, but critics argue that the changes were politically motivated. The CIA's involvement in removing certain references is a point of contention. The timing of the release is also questioned, and the White House hopes this puts the issue to rest.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and accurately represents the article's content while highlighting the moral framing. I'll start by stating the release of emails, mention the Republicans' cover-up claims, the White House's stance, the role of the CIA, the criticism from both sides, and the administration's hope to move past the issue.

Let me make sure I include all the key points and the morally charged words without making the summary too lengthy. I should also check that the summary doesn't add any new information beyond what's in the article and stays true to the original framing.

* better protected  

**SUMMARY:**  
The White House released emails related to the development of talking points about the 2012 Benghazi attack, addressing Republican claims of a political "cover-up." The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple agencies, including the CIA, and not just the State Department. Critics argue that the removal of references to al Qaeda and security warnings was politically motivated, while the administration insists such changes were made to avoid prejudging the FBI investigation. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland was criticized for removing a line about previous attacks, but CIA deputy director Michael Morell also requested the change, deeming it irrelevant. The CIA's internal review revealed that changes were made for accuracy and to avoid hindering the investigation. The timing of the document release has been questioned, with critics suggesting it may have been politically motivated. The White House hopes the release will address ongoing criticisms and focus on improving protections for U.S. personnel abroad. END OF SUMMARY.
