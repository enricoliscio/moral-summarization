Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Benghazi emails. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing the author used. Hmm, the article talks about the White House releasing emails related to the talking points about the 2012 Benghazi attack. Republicans accused a political cover-up, but the emails don't support that theory. Instead, they show multiple agencies, including CIA, involved in changing the talking points. The State Department's Victoria Nuland tried to remove a line about previous attacks, but CIA's Morell also wanted it out. The CIA's internal review found changes were for accuracy, not politics. The White House's timing of releasing the emails is questioned, but they hope it settles the issue.

Wait, the user mentioned I should be a news summarizer and a moral expert. So I need to capture the moral implications. The article suggests that while there was coordination, it wasn't a political cover-up but more about accuracy and investigation sensitivity. Republicans still think it's political. The summary should reflect that tension without bias.

I should structure it to mention the release of emails, the initial Republican claims, the findings showing multiple agencies involved, specific examples like Nuland and Morell, the CIA's internal review, and the criticism about the timing. Also, note the White House's hope to resolve the issue.

Let me make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes the key points without getting too detailed. I need to balance the facts with the moral framing, showing both sides but emphasizing the official stance that it wasn't a cover-up.

Alright, putting it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: The White House released emails related to the development of talking points about the 2012 Benghazi attack, addressing Republican claims of a political cover-up. The emails show that multiple agencies, including the CIA, were involved in revising the talking points, not just the State Department. Critics accused the State Department of altering the talking points to protect its image, particularly after Victoria Nuland requested removing a reference to previous attacks. However, the CIA also wanted that line removed, deeming it irrelevant. The CIA's internal review found that changes were made for accuracy and to avoid prejudicing the FBI investigation, not for political reasons. The release of emails aimed to clarify the process but raised questions about the timing and motivations behind the revisions. The White House hopes this resolves the issue, emphasizing that the focus should now be on improving protections for U.S. personnel abroad. END OF SUMMARY.
