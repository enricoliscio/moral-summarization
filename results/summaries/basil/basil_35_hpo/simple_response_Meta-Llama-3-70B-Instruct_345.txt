SUMMARY:

The White House has released 100 pages of emails related to the development of talking points on the 2012 Benghazi attack, refuting claims of a political "cover-up" to influence the 2012 election. The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points. Contrary to Republican lawmakers' claims, the CIA requested the removal of references to al Qaeda and security warnings, citing concerns about accuracy and an ongoing FBI investigation. The emails also reveal that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's revisions were not solely motivated by a desire to protect the administration's reputation. The release of the emails is seen as an attempt to put to rest the Benghazi issue, with White House officials stressing that the interagency process was focused on providing facts and protecting an ongoing investigation. The release is also seen as a response to continuing criticism and requests for more information from congressional Republicans.
