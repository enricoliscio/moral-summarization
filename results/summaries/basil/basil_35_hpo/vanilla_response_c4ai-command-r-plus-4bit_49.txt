SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails on Wednesday related to the development of talking points describing the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya. The release was in response to continuing accusations from congressional Republicans of a political "cover-up." The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple government agencies, including the CIA and the State Department, and not for political reasons as alleged by critics. In particular, references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings were removed at the request of the CIA to avoid prejudging an ongoing FBI investigation. While the document release addresses some criticisms of the White House's handling of Benghazi, it may also fuel demands for further document disclosures. Speaker of the House John Boehner's spokesman suggested that the emails confirmed earlier findings that the State Department sought changes to the talking points to avoid criticism for ignoring threat warnings. White House spokesman Eric Schultz defended the release as an effort to set the record straight and refocus attention on improving protection for Americans serving overseas.
END OF SUMMARY.
