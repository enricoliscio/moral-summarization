SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails on Wednesday related to the development of talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice following the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya. The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple government agencies, including the CIA, and not solely by the State Department as previously alleged by Republican lawmakers. Critics had argued that the State Department and White House altered the talking points for political reasons, but the emails do not support this theory. Senior administration officials stressed that references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings were removed at the request of the CIA, not the State Department. The timing of the document release has raised questions, as critics argue that the administration is now willing to accommodate demands for documents. However, the White House spokesman Eric Schultz stated that the emails were released to set the record straight and hoped that the issue would now be put to rest.
END OF SUMMARY.
