SUMMARY:
The White House released 100 pages of emails related to the development of talking points about the 2012 Benghazi attack, aiming to dispel theories of a political "cover-up." The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points. Critics had argued that the administration altered the points to protect its reputation as being tough on terrorism. However, senior officials stressed that language was removed at the request of the CIA, citing concerns about accuracy and an ongoing FBI investigation. The release raises questions about the timing and motivations behind the changes. Despite the administration's efforts to put the issue to rest, critics remain critical, citing the "seemingly political nature" of the State Department's concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
