SUMMARY: The White House released emails regarding the Obama administration's talking points about the Benghazi attack, refuting Republican accusations of a massive political cover-up. The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple government agencies, including the CIA, and not just the State Department as previously accused. Senior administration officials emphasized that references to al Qaeda and security warnings were removed at the CIA's request to avoid prejudging an ongoing FBI investigation. Critics still claim the State Department's involvement shows an attempt to protect its reputation and ignore security warnings. The timing of the document release has raised questions about the administration's willingness to accommodate demands and justify its actions. The emails do soften some of the more critical theories, but they may also embolden critics who see political motivations in the White House's response. Despite the release, some lawmakers remain disappointed in what they see as an unfair justification of the administration's actions. END OF SUMMARY
