SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails regarding the development of talking points about the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, in response to charges of a political "cover-up" by Republican lawmakers. The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple government agencies, including the CIA, and not just the State Department as previously alleged. Contrary to theories of a political alteration, the emails reveal that references to al Qaeda and security warnings were removed at the request of the CIA to avoid prejudging an ongoing FBI investigation. While the release of these documents may soften some criticism of the White House's handling of the Benghazi attack, it also raises questions about the timing of the disclosure and could embolden critics who see an administration willing to accommodate document demands. The White House spokesperson expressed hope that the disclosure would put the Benghazi issue to rest and shift the focus to improving protection for those serving overseas.
END OF SUMMARY.
