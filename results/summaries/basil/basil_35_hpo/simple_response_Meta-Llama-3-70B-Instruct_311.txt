SUMMARY:

The White House has released 100 pages of emails related to the development of talking points about the 2012 Benghazi attack, aiming to dispel Republican claims of a political "cover-up." The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points. Contrary to critics' claims, the CIA, not the State Department, requested the removal of references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings. The emails also reveal that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's revisions were not solely motivated by a desire to protect the administration's reputation. Instead, she and CIA deputy director Michael Morell shared concerns about the relevance and professionalism of including certain information. The release of these emails raises questions about the timing and motivations behind the administration's decision to make them public. While the emails may soften some criticisms, they may also embolden critics who see the administration as willing to accommodate demands for documents.

END OF SUMMARY.
