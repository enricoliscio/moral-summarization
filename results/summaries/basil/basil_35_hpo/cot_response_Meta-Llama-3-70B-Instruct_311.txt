SUMMARY:
The White House released 100 pages of emails related to the development of talking points about the 2012 Benghazi attack, refuting claims of a "cover-up" to influence the election. The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points. Critics had argued that the administration was trying to alter the talking points for political reasons, but senior officials stressed that language was removed at the request of the CIA. The emails reveal that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland and CIA deputy director Michael J. Morell both wanted to remove a line about previous security warnings, with Morell believing it was irrelevant and unprofessional to include. The White House hopes the release will put the Benghazi issue to rest, but critics remain skeptical about the motivations behind the changes. END OF SUMMARY.
