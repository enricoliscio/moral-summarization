SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails on Wednesday related to the development of talking points describing the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya. The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple government agencies, including the CIA and the State Department, and not for political reasons as some Republican lawmakers have alleged. The emails reveal that references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings were removed at the request of the CIA to avoid prejudging an ongoing FBI investigation. While the release of the emails may soften some criticism of the White House's handling of Benghazi, it also raises questions about the timing of the disclosure and could embolden critics seeking further document releases. The White House defended the release as an effort to set the record straight and put the Benghazi issue to rest.
END OF SUMMARY.
