SUMMARY:

The White House has released 100 pages of emails related to the development of talking points on the 2012 Benghazi attack, amid accusations of a political "cover-up" by congressional Republicans. The emails reveal that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points. Senior administration officials stress that language referencing al Qaeda and previous security warnings was removed at the request of the CIA, not for political reasons. Critics had argued that the State Department and White House were attempting to alter the talking points to avoid criticism and protect their reputation as being tough on terrorism. The emails show that the CIA was concerned about accuracy, an FBI investigation, and bureaucratic matters, leading to changes to the original draft. The White House hopes the release will put the Benghazi issue to rest, after 11 hearings, 25,000 pages of documents, and numerous accusations of ignoring warnings and attempting to alter the truth.

END OF SUMMARY.
