SUMMARY: In response to accusations of a political "cover-up" by Republican lawmakers, the White House released 100 pages of emails detailing the development of talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to describe the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya. The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven not just by the State Department but by multiple government agencies, including the CIA. Contrary to claims of a political motive, the emails reveal that references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings were removed at the request of the CIA to avoid prejudging an ongoing FBI investigation. While the release of the emails may temper some of the more critical theories about the White House's handling of Benghazi, it also raises questions about the timing of the disclosure and may fuel further demands for transparency from critics. The White House, however, maintains that the emails demonstrate a good faith effort to provide accurate information while protecting an ongoing investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
