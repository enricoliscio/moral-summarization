SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails on Wednesday regarding the Obama administration's talking points on the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya. The emails contradict theories of a massive political "cover-up" and show that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple government agencies, including the CIA. Contrary to accusations, the State Department did not act alone in altering the talking points and removing references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings. The emails reveal that the CIA also wanted these changes to protect an ongoing FBI investigation and avoid prejudgment. Senior administration officials have defended their actions, stating that their interactions were focused on providing facts and protecting the investigation. The document release comes after months of criticism and requests for more information, raising questions about the timing and motivations of the White House. Critics argue that the State Department's concerns were politically motivated, while the administration maintains that their priority was protecting those serving overseas.
END OF SUMMARY.
