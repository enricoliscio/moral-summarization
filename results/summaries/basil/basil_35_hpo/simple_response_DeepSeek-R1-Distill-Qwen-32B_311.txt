Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully. 

The article is about the White House releasing emails related to the Benghazi attack talking points. The main points are that the emails show the talking points were changed by multiple agencies, not just the State Department. Republicans accused a political cover-up, but the emails don't support that. The changes were made for accuracy and not politics. Victoria Nuland wanted to remove a line about past attacks, but the CIA also wanted it removed. The CIA did an internal review, which found changes were for accuracy and not political. The White House released the emails to address criticism, but some Republicans still think it's political. The White House hopes this ends the debate.

I need to make sure the summary captures the back-and-forth between the administration's claims and the Republican accusations, highlighting that while the emails don't prove a cover-up, they do show some political concerns. I should keep it under 200 words and use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed. Let me structure it to first mention the release of emails, then the administration's stance, Republican accusations, specific examples like Nuland and the CIA's role, the internal review, and the ongoing debate. I'll end with the administration's hope to move past the issue.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise, ensuring the moral framing is preserved by showing both sides of the argument without bias.

SUMMARY: The White House released emails regarding the development of talking points about the 2012 Benghazi attack, addressing Republican claims of a political cover-up. The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple agencies, including the CIA, and not solely by the State Department. Critics argue that the removal of references to al-Qaeda and security warnings indicated a political motive to protect the administration's image. However, senior officials stated that such changes were made at the CIA's request, emphasizing accuracy and avoiding premature conclusions. The CIA's internal review confirmed that changes were made due to concerns about accuracy and ongoing investigations, not politics. The release of emails aims to clarify the process but has not fully resolved争议, as Republicans continue to question the administration's motivations. The White House hopes this transparency will move the focus to improving security for overseas personnel. END OF SUMMARY.
