SUMMARY:

The White House has released 100 pages of emails related to the development of talking points about the 2012 Benghazi attack, in response to Republican claims of a political "cover-up". The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points. Contrary to Republican claims, the emails do not support theories that the talking points were changed to influence the 2012 election. The CIA requested removal of references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings, citing concerns about accuracy and an ongoing FBI investigation. The emails also reveal that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's revisions were not politically motivated, but rather aimed to avoid criticism for ignoring security warnings. The release of the emails is seen as an attempt to put to rest the Benghazi issue, which has been the subject of 11 hearings and 25,000 pages of documents.

END OF SUMMARY.
