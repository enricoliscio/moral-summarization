SUMMARY:

The White House has released 100 pages of emails related to the development of talking points on the 2012 Benghazi attack, in response to Republican claims of a political "cover-up". The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice. Contrary to Republican claims, the emails reveal that references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings were removed at the request of the CIA, not for political reasons. The emails also show that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's revisions were not unique, and that CIA officials had similar concerns about accuracy and an ongoing FBI investigation. The release of the emails aims to put to rest the Benghazi issue, with White House officials stressing that the interagency process was focused on providing facts and protecting an ongoing investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
