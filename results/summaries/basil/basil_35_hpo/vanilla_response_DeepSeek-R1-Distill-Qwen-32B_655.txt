Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the White House releasing emails related to the Benghazi attack talking points. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that the White House released a set of emails in response to Republican claims of a political cover-up. They wanted to show that the talking points weren't changed for political reasons, especially around the 2012 election. The emails cover the development of these talking points after the 2012 attack in Benghazi.

I see that the main issue is whether the talking points were altered politically. The White House claims that multiple agencies, not just the State Department, were involved in changing the talking points. They mention that the CIA also requested some changes, like removing references to al Qaeda and other attacks, to avoid influencing the FBI investigation.

There's a part where Victoria Nuland from the State Department wanted to remove a line about previous attacks, fearing it would be used against the State Department. The CIA's deputy director, Michael Morell, also wanted that line removed, thinking it was irrelevant. The CIA's internal review found that changes were made for accuracy and not political reasons.

The article also notes that the timing of releasing the emails is questionedâ€”why now? Critics like Boehner's spokesperson argue that the emails confirm the State Department's political motives, contradicting the White House's earlier claims of minimal changes.

The White House spokesperson, Eric Schultz, hopes this release will end the Benghazi issue, emphasizing that the process was about providing facts and protecting the investigation.

So, putting it all together, the summary should include the release of emails, the involvement of multiple agencies, the reasons for changes (accuracy, CIA requests, avoiding political criticism), the timing of the release, and the reactions from both the White House and critics.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll structure it by first stating the release and the purpose, then the key points from the emails, the involvement of the CIA, the critics' reactions, and the White House's response.

The emails show that changes to the talking points were made by multiple agencies, including the CIA, for accuracy and to avoid influencing the FBI investigation.

The CIA also requested changes, like removing al Qaeda mentions, to avoid prejudicing the investigation. The White House aims to end the Benghazi debate, emphasizing the focus on facts and the investigation. Critics, however, remain skeptical, pointing to the emails as evidence of political motives.
