Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the listed morally charged words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the release of emails regarding the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack talking points. Republicans accused a political cover-up, but the emails don't support that theory. The changes to the talking points were made by multiple agencies, including the CIA, not just the State Department. The removal of references to al Qaeda and other groups was done to avoid influencing the election and to protect the FBI investigation. The White House released the emails to address criticism and clarify their actions.

Now, I'll identify the key morally framed words from the article: attack, charges, theories, portrayed, attempting, alter, ignored, attacks, abused, beat, assault, demonstrations, willing, accommodate, avoid, ignoring, statements, changed, selectively, inaccurately, read, providing, protecting, working, protected.

I need to incorporate these words into the summary. I'll structure the summary to include the accusations, the emails' content, the reasons for changes, and the administration's response. I'll make sure to highlight the moral implications, such as the attempt to alter talking points, the accusations of ignoring warnings, and the administration's efforts to protect the investigation.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while including the required moral language. I'll start by stating the release of emails in response to charges, mention the theories, and then detail the findings that refute those theories. I'll include the actions of the State Department and CIA, the reasons for changes, and the administration's response to criticism.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include as many of the specified words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and ensure clarity.

SUMMARY: The White House released emails addressing charges of a political "cover-up" surrounding the 2012 Benghazi attack, refuting theories that talking points were altered for political gain. The emails show multiple agencies, including the CIA, influenced changes, such as removing references to al Qaeda to avoid prejudicing the FBI investigation. Critics accused the State Department of attempting to alter the narrative to protect its image, with Victoria Nuland seeking to remove mentions of prior attacks. However, CIA officials also supported these changes, deeming some details irrelevant or premature. The release aimed to address ongoing criticism and clarify that changes were driven by accuracy and investigation protection. While it softens some accusations, it may embolden critics who see a willingness to accommodate political demands. The administration hopes this transparency will resolve the issue and focus on protecting future missions. END OF SUMMARY.
