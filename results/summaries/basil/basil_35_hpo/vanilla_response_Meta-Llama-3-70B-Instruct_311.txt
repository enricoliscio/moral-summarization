SUMMARY:

The White House has released 100 pages of emails related to the development of talking points on the 2012 Benghazi attack, in response to Republican claims of a "cover-up". The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice. Contrary to Republican claims, the emails do not support theories that the talking points were changed to influence the 2012 election. Senior administration officials stressed that references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings were removed at the request of the CIA, not for political reasons. The emails also reveal that the CIA conducted an internal review of the talking points, which showed that changes were made for accuracy, bureaucratic, and FBI investigation concerns. The release of the emails may soften some criticism, but it also raises questions about the timing and motivations behind the administration's decision to make them public.

END OF SUMMARY.
