SUMMARY:

The White House has released 100 pages of emails related to the development of talking points on the 2012 Benghazi attack, in response to Republican charges of a political "cover-up". The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points. Critics had argued that the State Department and White House attempted to alter the talking points for political reasons, ignoring CIA suggestions and removing references to al Qaeda and security warnings. However, senior administration officials stress that the CIA requested these changes, citing concerns about accuracy and an ongoing FBI investigation. The emails also reveal that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's revisions were not politically motivated, but rather aimed to avoid providing ammunition to Congress to "beat up" the State Department. The release of these emails aims to put to rest the Benghazi issue, showing that the administration's focus was on providing facts and protecting the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
