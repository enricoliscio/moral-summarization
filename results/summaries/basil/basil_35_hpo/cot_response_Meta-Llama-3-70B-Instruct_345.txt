SUMMARY:
The White House has released 100 pages of emails related to the development of talking points on the 2012 Benghazi attack, aiming to dispel Republican claims of a "cover-up" for political gain. The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points. Senior administration officials stressed that references to al Qaeda were removed at the request of the CIA, not to protect the administration's reputation as being tough on terrorism. The emails also reveal that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's concerns about the department's image were shared by CIA officials. The release of the emails is seen as an attempt to put to rest the Benghazi issue, which has been criticized and politicized for months. The White House hopes that the disclosure will allow Congress to focus on more important issues, such as protecting those serving overseas. END OF SUMMARY.
