SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails on Wednesday regarding the development of talking points for the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, in response to charges of a political "cover-up" by Republican lawmakers. The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple government agencies and do not support theories of a politically motivated alteration. Senior administration officials stressed that references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings were removed at the request of the CIA, not the State Department, to avoid prejudging an ongoing FBI investigation. Critics have accused the State Department of attempting to protect its reputation and ignoring security threats, but officials countered that the CIA also wanted certain information removed. The timing of the document release has raised questions, as critics argue that the White House is now willing to accommodate demands for documents. However, the White House spokesman Eric Schultz stated that the emails should put to rest the Benghazi issue, showing that the administration was focused on providing facts and protecting the ongoing investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
