Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the White House releasing emails related to the Benghazi attack talking points from 2012. Republicans have been accusing the Obama administration of a political cover-up to influence the election. The emails show that multiple agencies, not just the State Department, were involved in changing the talking points. 

They mention that the CIA requested some changes, like removing references to al Qaeda and other attacks, to avoid affecting the FBI investigation. The State Department's Victoria Nuland also made changes, which critics say were to protect the administration's image. The White House released these emails to counter the cover-up claims, emphasizing that the changes were about accuracy and the investigation, not politics.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I'll highlight the key points: the email release, the involvement of multiple agencies, the CIA's role in changes, the State Department's actions, and the administration's response to criticism. I should make sure to mention that the emails don't support the cover-up theory but do show some political concerns from the State Department. Also, note the timing of the release and the ongoing debate it sparks.

Let me structure it: start with the release of emails, the context of Republican accusations, the findings from the emails (CIA involvement, changes for investigation, State Department's image concerns), and the administration's aim to refute cover-up claims. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The White House released a set of emails related to the development of talking points about the 2012 Benghazi attack, addressing Republican claims of a political cover-up. The emails show that multiple agencies, including the CIA, were involved in modifying the talking points, contrary to accusations that the State Department alone was responsible. The CIA requested changes, such as removing references to al Qaeda, to avoid influencing the FBI investigation. State Department officials, like Victoria Nuland, also made changes, which critics argue were to protect the administration's image. The release aims to refute claims of a political motive, emphasizing that changes were made for accuracy and to avoid prejudicing the investigation. However, critics, including House Speaker John Boehner's spokesman, argue that the emails confirm political interference. The White House hopes the release will settle the Benghazi issue, allowing focus on improving security for U.S. personnel abroad. END OF SUMMARY.
