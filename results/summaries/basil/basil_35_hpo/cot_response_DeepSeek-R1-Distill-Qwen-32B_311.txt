Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Benghazi emails, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author used. First, I should go through the article and identify the morally framed words. Let me read through it again.

The article talks about the White House releasing emails related to the talking points about the Benghazi attack. The key moral terms I see are "cover-up," "politicized," "abused," "prejudging," "unprofessional," "selectively," "inaccurately," and "extraordinary." These words carry moral implications, indicating issues like deception, bias, unfairness, and improper handling of information.

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words to maintain the original moral framing. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and include the main points: the release of emails, the claims of a cover-up, the involvement of multiple agencies, the removal of al Qaeda references, the CIA's role, and the political implications.

I should start by stating that the White House released emails to address the cover-up allegations. Then mention that the emails don't support the cover-up theory but show changes by multiple agencies. Highlight the removal of al Qaeda references at the CIA's request. Also, note the criticism about the State Department's actions and the timing of the document release. Conclude with the administration's hope to resolve the issue.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without going over the word limit. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is included where appropriate.

**SUMMARY:**
The White House released emails addressing claims of a political "cover-up" surrounding the 2012 Benghazi attack, revealing that changes to the talking points were made by multiple agencies, including the CIA. Critics argue the State Department's actions were "politicized," particularly Victoria Nuland's request to remove references to prior attacks, which she feared could be "abused" by Congress. The CIA also sought to remove al Qaeda mentions to avoid "prejudging" the FBI investigation, deeming some language "unprofessional." The timing of the document release, after months of criticism, was seen as "selectively" timed, with critics questioning the administration's "inaccurate" handling. The White House aimed to clarify the process, emphasizing focus on factual accuracy and investigation integrity. However, the release may "embolden" critics, highlighting the "extraordinary" measures taken. The administration hopes this resolves the issue, focusing on protecting overseas personnel. END OF SUMMARY.
