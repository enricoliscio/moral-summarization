SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails on Wednesday pertaining to the development of talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to describe the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya. The release comes in response to continuing accusations from Republicans that the Obama administration engaged in a political "cover-up" of the incident. The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple government agencies, including the CIA, and not just the State Department as previously alleged. Critics had pointed to the role of State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in requesting the removal of a line about previous security warnings, but the emails revealed that then-CIA deputy director Michael J. Morell also wanted the line removed for separate reasons. Senior administration officials stressed that the CIA, not the State Department, drove many of the changes, including the removal of references to al Qaeda. The timing of the document release has raised questions, as critics argue that it could embolden demands for further document disclosures. However, the White House hopes that the disclosure will put to rest the issue of Benghazi.
END OF SUMMARY.
