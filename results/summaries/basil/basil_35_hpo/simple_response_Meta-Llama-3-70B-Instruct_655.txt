SUMMARY:

The White House has released 100 pages of emails related to the development of talking points on the 2012 Benghazi attack, refuting claims of a political "cover-up" to influence the 2012 election. The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points. Contrary to Republican lawmakers' claims, the CIA requested the removal of references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings, citing concerns about accuracy and not wanting to prejudice an FBI investigation. The emails also reveal that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's revisions were not politically motivated, but rather aimed to avoid providing ammunition to critics. The release of the emails is seen as an attempt to put to rest the Benghazi controversy, which has been fueled by selective and inaccurate reporting of previous emails. The White House hopes that this transparency will allow for a shift in focus towards ensuring better protection for those serving overseas.
