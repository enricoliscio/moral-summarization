SUMMARY:
The White House released 100 pages of emails related to the development of talking points about the 2012 Benghazi attack, aiming to dispel claims of a political "cover-up". The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points. Critics had argued that the administration was trying to alter the talking points for political reasons, ignoring CIA suggestions and removing references to al Qaeda and security warnings. However, senior officials stressed that the CIA itself requested these changes, citing concerns about accuracy and not wanting to prejudice an FBI investigation. The email release raises questions about the administration's motivations and why it chose to make the emails public now. The White House hopes the disclosure will put the Benghazi issue to rest, but critics remain skeptical. END OF SUMMARY.
