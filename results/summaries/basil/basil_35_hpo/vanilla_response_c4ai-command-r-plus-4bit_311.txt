SUMMARY: The White House released emails related to the development of talking points describing the Benghazi attack, which show that changes were driven by multiple government agencies, including the CIA. Republicans have accused the State Department and White House of altering the talking points for political reasons, but the emails do not support this theory. Administration officials stressed that references to al Qaeda and security warnings were removed at the CIA's request to avoid prejudging an FBI investigation. The timing of the document release has raised questions, as critics argue it could embolden demands for further document disclosures. However, the White House defended the release as an effort to provide transparency and put to rest the Benghazi issue.
END OF SUMMARY.
