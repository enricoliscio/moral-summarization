Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let's read through it carefully. The article is about the release of emails related to the Benghazi attack talking points from the Obama administration. Republicans have been accusing a political cover-up, but the emails don't support that. Instead, they show multiple agencies, including the CIA, were involved in changing the talking points. 

The key points are: the emails were released to counter claims of a cover-up, changes were made by various agencies, not just State Department, the CIA wanted some info removed for accuracy and investigation reasons, and the timing of the release is questioned. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the main points: the release, the involvement of multiple agencies, the reasons behind changes, and the political implications. Also, mention the criticism from Republicans and the administration's response.

Let me structure it: start with the release of emails, explain the context of the accusations, then detail the findings from the emails, the involvement of CIA and other agencies, the specific changes made, and the political debate it's causing. Conclude with the administration's hope to end the issue.

Make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit. Avoid jargon, keep it clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: The White House released emails related to the development of talking points about the 2012 Benghazi attack, addressing Republican claims of a political cover-up. The emails show that multiple agencies, including the CIA, contributed to changes in the talking points, not just the State Department. Critics had accused the administration of altering the points to protect its image, but the emails reveal that the CIA, for example, requested removing references to al Qaeda to avoid prejudging the FBI investigation. The release aims to clarify the process, which focused on accuracy and the ongoing investigation. Republicans, however, argue the changes still appear politically motivated. The administration hopes the documents will resolve the issue, emphasizing a focus on protecting overseas personnel. END OF SUMMARY.
