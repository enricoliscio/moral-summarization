SUMMARY:

The White House has released a set of emails related to the development of talking points on the 2012 Benghazi attack, in response to Republican charges of a "cover-up". The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points. The release aims to dispel theories that the talking points were altered to influence the 2012 election. Senior administration officials stressed that language referencing al Qaeda was removed at the CIA's request, and not for political reasons. The emails also reveal that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's revisions were not solely motivated by a desire to protect the administration's reputation. Instead, the CIA also wanted certain information removed, citing concerns about accuracy and an ongoing FBI investigation. The release raises questions about the timing and motivations behind the administration's decision to make the emails public. Critics argue that the emails confirm a political nature to the State Department's concerns, while the White House hopes the release will put the Benghazi issue to rest. END OF SUMMARY.
