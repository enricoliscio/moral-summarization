SUMMARY:

The White House has released a set of emails surrounding the development of talking points on the 2012 Benghazi attack, aiming to debunk Republican claims of a "cover-up" to influence the 2012 election. The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points. Critics had argued that the State Department and White House altered the talking points for political reasons, ignoring CIA suggestions and removing references to al Qaeda and security warnings. However, senior administration officials stress that the CIA itself requested these changes to avoid prejudging the FBI investigation's outcome. The emails also reveal that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's revisions were not politically motivated, but rather aimed to avoid "beating up" the State Department over ignored warnings. The release of these emails raises questions about the timing and motivations behind the administration's decision to accommodate demands for documents. Despite this, the White House hopes the disclosure will put the Benghazi issue to rest.

END OF SUMMARY.
