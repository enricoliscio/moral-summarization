SUMMARY:

The White House has released 100 pages of emails related to the development of talking points on the 2012 Benghazi attack, in response to Republican claims of a political "cover-up". The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points. Contrary to Republican claims, the emails reveal that references to al Qaeda and security warnings were removed at the request of the CIA, not for political reasons. The emails also show that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's role in revising the talking points was not unique, and that CIA officials also wanted certain information removed. The release of the emails is seen as an attempt to put to rest the Benghazi issue, which has been the subject of 11 hearings and 25,000 pages of documents.

END OF SUMMARY.
