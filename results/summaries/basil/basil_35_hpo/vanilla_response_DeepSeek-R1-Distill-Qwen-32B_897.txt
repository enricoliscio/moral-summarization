SUMMARY: The White House released emails related to the development of talking points about the 2012 Benghazi attack, addressing Republican claims of a political cover-up. The emails show that multiple agencies, including the CIA, contributed to changes in the talking points, not just the State Department. Critics had accused the administration of altering the talking points to avoid criticism and protect its image, particularly regarding references to al Qaeda and security warnings. However, senior officials stated that such changes were made at the CIA's request, not for political reasons. The CIA also conducted an internal review, revealing that changes were made for accuracy and to avoid prejudging the FBI investigation. The White House emphasized that the process focused on providing facts and protecting the investigation. Critics, including House Speaker John Boehner's spokesman, argue that the emails confirm the State Department's political motivations. The White House hopes the release will resolve the issue, after months of scrutiny and 11 hearings. END OF SUMMARY.
