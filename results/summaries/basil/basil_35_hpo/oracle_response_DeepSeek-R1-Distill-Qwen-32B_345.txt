Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making it sound forced. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The White House released emails about the Benghazi attack talking points. Republicans accused them of a political cover-up. The emails show that changes were made by multiple agencies, not just the State Department. The CIA was involved in removing references to al Qaeda and other groups. Some critics argue that the State Department was trying to protect its image. The White House aims to clear up the issue with this release.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the release of emails and the charges of a cover-up. Then, note that the emails don't support the theories but show interagency involvement. Highlight the CIA's role in altering the talking points, the removal of al Qaeda references, and the State Department's actions to avoid criticism. Include the criticism from Republicans and the White House's response, emphasizing factual accuracy and protecting the investigation. End with the hope to move past the issue.

I'll make sure to use words like "attack," "charges," "theories," "portrayed," "attempting," "alter," "ignored," "abused," "beat," "assault," "demonstrations," "willing," "accommodate," "avoid," "ignoring," "statements," "changed," "selectively," "inaccurately," "read," "providing," "protecting," "working," "protected." I'll weave these into the summary naturally.

I should also keep the summary concise, ensuring each sentence conveys a key point without being too wordy. Let me draft it step by step, checking word count and moral framing.

SUMMARY: The White House released emails regarding the Obama administration's development of talking points on the 2012 Benghazi attack, addressing Republican charges of a political "cover-up." The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple agencies, not just the State Department, and refute theories of election influence. Critics argue the State Department altered the talking points to avoid criticism, removing references to al Qaeda and security warnings. However, senior officials claim the CIA also requested such changes, emphasizing accuracy and avoiding prejudicing the FBI investigation. The release aims to clarify the interagency process, focusing on factual accuracy and protecting the investigation. Critics, like House Speaker Boehner's spokesman, argue the emails confirm the State Department's political motivations. The White House hopes this transparency will resolve the issue, emphasizing a focus on protecting U.S. personnel abroad. END OF SUMMARY.
