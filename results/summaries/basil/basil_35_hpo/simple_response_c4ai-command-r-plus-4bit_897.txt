SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails on Wednesday revealing the full extent of the Obama administration's talking points on the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya. The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple government agencies, including the CIA, and not solely by the State Department as previously alleged by Republican lawmakers. Contrary to accusations of a political "cover-up," the emails reveal that references to al Qaeda and security warnings were removed at the request of the CIA to avoid prejudging the outcome of an ongoing FBI investigation. While the document release addresses some criticisms of the White House's handling of the Benghazi incident, it also raises questions about the timing of the disclosure and may fuel further demands for transparency. Despite the release of the emails, some critics continue to assert that the State Department's concerns were politically motivated, and that the administration is not being fully forthcoming about the events in Benghazi.
END OF SUMMARY.
