SUMMARY: Continuing charges from congressional Republicans accusing the Obama administration of a massive political cover-up regarding the Benghazi attack have led the White House to release 100 pages of emails related to the talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice. The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple government agencies, including the CIA, and not just the State Department as previously alleged. While the emails do not support theories of a political cover-up, critics have seized on the role of State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in revising the talking points, arguing that the administration was trying to protect its reputation in the face of terrorism. The timing of the document release has also raised questions about the administration's motivations and willingness to accommodate demands for documents. The White House has defended its actions, hoping that the disclosure will put to rest the Benghazi accusations and allow officials to spend time on more important matters, such as protecting those serving the nation overseas.
