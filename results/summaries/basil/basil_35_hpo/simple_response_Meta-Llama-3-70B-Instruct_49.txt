SUMMARY:

The White House has released a 100-page email cache related to the development of talking points on the 2012 Benghazi attack, refuting claims of a political "cover-up" to influence the 2012 election. The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points. Critics had argued that the State Department and White House altered the talking points to protect their reputation on terrorism, but senior administration officials stress that language was removed at the CIA's request. The emails reveal a focus on accuracy, an FBI investigation, and bureaucratic concerns, rather than political motivations. The release of the emails raises questions about the timing, but the White House hopes it will put the Benghazi issue to rest. The administration claims the emails demonstrate a focus on providing facts and protecting an ongoing investigation, rather than a political cover-up.

END OF SUMMARY.
