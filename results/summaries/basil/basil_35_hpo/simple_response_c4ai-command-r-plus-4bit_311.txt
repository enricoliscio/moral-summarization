SUMMARY: The White House on Wednesday released 100 pages of emails related to the development of talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to describe the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya. The release was made in response to continuing charges from congressional Republicans that there was a massive political “cover-up” and attempts to alter the talking points for political gain. The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven not just by the State Department, but by multiple government agencies, including the CIA. While critics have focused on the role of State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in revising the talking points, senior administration officials stressed that many changes were made over concerns about accuracy, an ongoing FBI investigation, and bureaucratic matters. An internal CIA review also found that many changes were made to protect the integrity of the FBI investigation and to avoid prejudging its outcome. The release of the emails by the White House may soften some of the criticism surrounding its handling of the Benghazi attack, but it also raises questions about the timing of the release and could embolden critics demanding further document disclosures.
