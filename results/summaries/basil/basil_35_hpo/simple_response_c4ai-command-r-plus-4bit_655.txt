SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails on Wednesday in an attempt to refute claims by Republican lawmakers that there was a political "cover-up" regarding the talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to describe the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya. The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven not just by the State Department, but by multiple government agencies, including the CIA. Contrary to accusations, the emails do not support theories of political manipulation. In fact, they reveal that the CIA, not just the State Department, drove many of the changes and was particularly concerned with not prejudicing an ongoing FBI investigation. While the document release may temper some of the more extreme theories surrounding the Benghazi attack, it also opens the administration up to further criticism and demands for transparency. The White House, however, maintains that the emails demonstrate a good faith effort to provide accurate information while protecting an ongoing investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
