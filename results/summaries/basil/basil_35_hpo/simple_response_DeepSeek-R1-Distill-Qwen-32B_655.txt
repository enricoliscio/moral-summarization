Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Benghazi emails. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article talks about the White House releasing emails related to the development of talking points after the Benghazi attack. Republicans accused the administration of a political cover-up. The emails don't support the cover-up theory for the 2012 election. The changes to the talking points were made by multiple agencies, not just the State Department. The CIA wanted some language removed, like references to al Qaeda and previous warnings, to avoid influencing the FBI investigation.

The summary should include that the emails don't support the cover-up theory, that multiple agencies were involved, the CIA's role in removing certain references, and the political implications. Also, mention the timing of the document release and the criticism from Republicans.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed. Make sure to highlight the moral framing, like the accusations of political motives versus the administration's claims of accuracy and investigation protection.

Alright, let me structure that into a concise summary.

SUMMARY: The White House released emails regarding the development of talking points about the 2012 Benghazi attack, addressing Republican claims of a political cover-up. The emails show that multiple agencies, including the CIA, contributed to changes in the talking points, not just the State Department. Critics argue that the removal of references to al Qaeda and security warnings reflects a political motive to protect the administration's image. However, senior officials and a CIA review indicate that such changes were made to ensure accuracy and avoid prejudicing the FBI investigation. The release of the emails aims to clarify the process, but Republicans remain skeptical, emphasizing the State Department's role in altering the talking points to avoid criticism. The timing of the document release has also raised questions. The administration hopes this move will settle the Benghazi issue and focus efforts on improving security for U.S. personnel abroad. END OF SUMMARY.
