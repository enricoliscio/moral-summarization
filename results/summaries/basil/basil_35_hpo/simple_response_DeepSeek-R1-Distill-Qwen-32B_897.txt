Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. The user specified that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about the release of emails related to the Benghazi attack talking points. The White House released them to counter Republican claims of a cover-up. The emails don't support the idea that the talking points were changed for political reasons in the 2012 election. The changes were made by multiple agencies, not just the State Department, and the CIA was involved too. 

The Republicans argue that the State Department and White House altered the talking points politically, removing references to al Qaeda. But the emails show the CIA also wanted those changes, not just the State Department. Victoria Nuland from the State Department wanted to remove a line about previous attacks, fearing it would be used against the State Department. The CIA's internal review found that changes were made for accuracy and not to influence the election.

The timing of the release is questioned—why now? Critics say it's to address ongoing criticism, and the release might not fully resolve the issue but could show the administration is responsive.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key points: the release of emails, the context of the Benghazi attack, the Republican claims of a cover-up, the findings in the emails that changes were made by multiple agencies including the CIA, the removal of al Qaeda references, Victoria Nuland's role, the CIA's internal review, and the timing of the release. Also, the moral framing is important—highlighting whether the changes were political or for other reasons.

I should structure the summary to first mention the release and the context, then the Republican claims, what the emails actually show (that changes were made by various agencies, including the CIA, for accuracy and investigation purposes), and the implications of the timing and the ongoing debate.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I have to be concise but include all these elements without going into too much detail. Also, the summary should end with the specified tokens.

Let me try to draft it step by step.

Start with the White House releasing emails about Benghazi talking points in response to Republican cover-up claims. Then, the emails don't support political manipulation for the election. Multiple agencies, including CIA, made changes. Republicans thought State Department and White House were altering for political reasons, but emails show CIA also involved. Mention Nuland's request to remove a line, but CIA also wanted it removed. CIA's internal review found changes were for accuracy and investigation, not politics. The timing of the release is questioned—why now? Critics say it's to address criticism, but it might not resolve the issue. The White House hopes it settles the matter, but the debate continues.

I think that covers all the key points. Now, I'll condense this into a coherent summary under 200 words, ensuring it flows well and preserves the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The White House released emails regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack talking points, addressing Republican claims of a political cover-up. The emails showed that changes to the talking points were made by multiple agencies, including the CIA, not just the State Department. Critics accused the administration of altering the talking points to downplay al Qaeda's role and protect its image, but the emails revealed that the CIA also requested such changes to avoid prejudicing the FBI investigation. Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, sought to remove a reference to previous attacks in Benghazi, fearing it could be used against the department. The CIA's internal review confirmed that changes were made for accuracy and to avoid influencing the investigation, not for political reasons. The timing of the document release raised questions, with critics suggesting it aimed to address ongoing criticism. The White House hoped the release would settle the Benghazi issue, but the debate over the administration's motivations persists. END OF SUMMARY.
