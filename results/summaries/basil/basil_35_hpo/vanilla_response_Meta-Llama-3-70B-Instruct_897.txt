SUMMARY:

The White House has released 100 pages of emails related to the development of talking points on the 2012 Benghazi attack, in response to Republican claims of a political "cover-up". The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points used by UN Ambassador Susan Rice. The emails contradict claims that the State Department and White House altered the talking points for political reasons, and instead show that changes were made to ensure accuracy and avoid prejudging an FBI investigation. The release of the emails is seen as an attempt to put to rest the Benghazi issue, which has been the subject of 11 hearings and 25,000 pages of documents.

END OF SUMMARY.
