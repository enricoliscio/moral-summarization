SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails on Wednesday regarding the talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to describe the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya. The release was a response to accusations from Republican lawmakers of a massive political cover-up and claims that the State Department and White House altered the talking points for political gain. The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple government agencies, including the CIA, which requested the removal of references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings. The State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's involvement in revising the talking points has been criticized as an attempt to protect the administration's reputation and ignore warnings about the attack. However, senior administration officials defended the changes, stating that concerns over accuracy, ongoing FBI investigations, and bureaucratic matters were the primary reasons for the revisions. Despite the White House's disclosure, critics continue to question the timing of the release and accuse the administration of accommodating demands for documents while ignoring more pressing issues. The White House, however, hopes that the release will put an end to the Benghazi controversy and allow for a focus on improving the protection of those serving overseas. END OF SUMMARY.
