SUMMARY:
The White House released 100 pages of emails surrounding the development of talking points on the 2012 Benghazi attack, aiming to dispel theories of a political "cover-up." The emails show that multiple government agencies, not just the State Department, drove changes to the talking points. Senior administration officials stressed that language referencing al Qaeda was removed at the CIA's request, and not for political reasons. The emails also reveal that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's concerns about the department's reputation were shared by CIA officials. The release of the emails aims to put to rest the Benghazi issue, which has been criticized and politicized. Despite the administration's efforts to provide facts and protect an ongoing investigation, critics continue to raise questions about the motivations behind the changes. END OF SUMMARY.
