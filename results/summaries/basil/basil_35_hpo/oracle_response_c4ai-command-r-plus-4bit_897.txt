SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails on Wednesday regarding the Obama administration's talking points on the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya. The emails refute Republican charges of a "cover-up" and show that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple government agencies, not just the State Department. Contrary to theories of political manipulation, the emails reveal that references to al Qaeda and security warnings were removed at the request of the CIA, not the State Department. While the emails do show that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland requested changes to protect the department from criticism, similar concerns were also raised by then-CIA deputy director Michael J. Morell. The CIA's internal review of the talking points changes concluded that they were made over concerns about accuracy, the FBI investigation, and bureaucratic matters. The timing of the document release has raised questions about the White House's motivations, as critics argue that the administration is now willing to accommodate demands for sensitive information. The White House, however, maintains that the emails demonstrate a focus on providing facts and protecting an ongoing investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
