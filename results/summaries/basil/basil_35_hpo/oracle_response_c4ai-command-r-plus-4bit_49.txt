SUMMARY: The White House released 100 pages of emails regarding the talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to describe the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya. The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven by multiple government agencies and not just the State Department as previously charged by Republican lawmakers. Contrary to accusations of a cover-up, the emails reveal that references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings were removed at the request of the CIA to avoid prejudging an ongoing FBI investigation. While the release of the emails may soften some of the criticism surrounding the White House's handling of the Benghazi attack, it also raises questions about the timing and motivations of the administration's decision to make them public. Critics argue that the State Department's concerns about protecting its reputation and avoiding criticism from Congress are evidence of a political nature behind the changes to the talking points. The White House, however, maintains that the emails demonstrate a focus on providing facts and protecting an ongoing investigation.
