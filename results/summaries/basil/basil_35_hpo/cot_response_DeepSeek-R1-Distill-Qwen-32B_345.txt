Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a sample response, but I should create my own. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about the release of emails related to the Benghazi attack talking points. The White House is responding to Republican claims of a cover-up. They released 100 pages of emails to show that multiple agencies, not just the State Department, were involved in changing the talking points. The main issue is whether the changes were politically motivated to influence the 2012 election.

I notice that the article mentions several morally charged words like "cover-up," "abuse," "concerned," "unprofessional," "premature," "illogical," "seemingly political," "motivations," "protecting," "ignoring," "selectively," "inaccurately," and "extraordinary step." These words are used to frame the actions of the administration and the State Department in a negative light.

In the summary, I should include these words to maintain the moral framing. I need to explain that the emails were released to address claims of a cover-up, that the changes were made by multiple agencies, and that critics argue the State Department was trying to protect its image. I should mention the removal of references to al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia, and the internal reviews by the CIA. Also, note that the release was timed in response to ongoing criticism.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: the release of emails, the involvement of multiple agencies, the political framing by Republicans, the role of CIA and State Department, and the administration's hope to resolve the issue.

Let me structure this step by step. Start with the release of emails, mention the purpose, then the findings, the critics' arguments, the internal reviews, and the administration's response. Make sure to use the morally framed words where appropriate.

I should also check that the summary doesn't add any new information but accurately reflects the article's content while preserving the moral framing. Avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes the necessary morally framed terms.

**SUMMARY:**

The White House released a cache of 100 emails to address Republican claims of a "cover-up" regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack talking points. These emails revealed that multiple agencies, including the CIA, were involved in altering the talking points, contrary to the narrative that the State Department acted alone for political gain. Critics argue that changes, such as removing references to al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia, were made to "protect" the administration's image and "ignore" security warnings, suggesting a "seemingly political" motive. The CIA's internal review confirmed that some changes aimed to avoid "prejudicing" the FBI investigation, while others were for accuracy. The administration hopes this release will "put to rest" the Benghazi issue, emphasizing that the process focused on "protecting" the investigation and providing factual information. However, Republicans maintain that the emails confirm their claims of politically motivated changes, highlighting the "motivations" behind the alterations. END OF SUMMARY.
