SUMMARY: The White House on Wednesday released 100 pages of emails relating to the development of talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to describe the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya. The release was made in response to continuing charges from congressional Republicans that there was a massive political “cover-up” of what happened in Benghazi and that the talking points were altered to influence the 2012 election. The emails show that changes to the talking points were driven not just by the State Department, but by several government agencies, including the CIA. Contrary to Republican claims, references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings were removed at the request of the CIA, not the State Department. Administration officials stressed that the internal review of the talking points showed that changes were made over concerns about accuracy, an ongoing FBI investigation, and bureaucratic matters. While the document release may soften some of the criticism of the White House's handling of Benghazi, it also raises questions about the timing of the release and could embolden critics who see an administration willing to accommodate demands for documents. Nevertheless, the White House expressed hope that the disclosure would put the Benghazi issue to rest.
END OF SUMMARY.
