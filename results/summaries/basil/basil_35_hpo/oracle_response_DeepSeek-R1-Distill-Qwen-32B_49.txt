Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the release of emails related to the Benghazi attack talking points. The White House is trying to counter Republican claims of a political cover-up. 

The key points are that the emails don't support the cover-up theory, multiple agencies were involved in changing the talking points, and the CIA was a major player. The article mentions specific changes, like removing references to al Qaeda and other attacks, which critics see as attempts to protect the administration's image. 

I need to use the morally charged words provided: attack, charges, theories, portrayed, attempting, alter, ignored, attacks, abused, beat, assault, demonstrations, willing, accommodate, avoid, ignoring, statements, changed, selectively, inaccurately, read, providing, protecting, working, protected.

I'll structure the summary to include these words. Start with the release of emails in response to charges. Mention that theories about election influence aren't supported. Highlight the involvement of multiple agencies, especially the CIA. Note the changes made, like removing al Qaeda references and other attacks. Critics argue this was to avoid criticism and protect the administration's image. The White House's move to release emails now is seen as accommodating critics, raising questions about timing. 

Make sure to include all the morally framed words without making the summary too long. Keep it concise, around 200 words. I'll need to weave these words naturally into the summary to maintain the moral tone the author intended.

SUMMARY: The White House released emails regarding the development of talking points on the 2012 Benghazi attack, addressing Republican charges of a political cover-up. The emails do not support theories that the talking points were altered to influence the 2012 election. Multiple agencies, including the CIA, were involved in changes, such as removing references to al Qaeda and prior attacks, which critics argue were attempts to avoid criticism and protect the administration's image. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland requested the removal of a line about previous attacks, fearing it could be "abused" by Congress. CIA deputy director Michael Morell also wanted the line removed, deeming it irrelevant. The CIA's internal review revealed changes were made for accuracy and to avoid prejudging the FBI investigation. The timing of the document release raised questions, with critics suggesting it may have been done to "accommodate" demands for transparency. The White House hoped the release would "put to rest" the Benghazi issue, emphasizing a focus on protecting ongoing investigations and improving overseas security. END OF SUMMARY.
