Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Robert Mueller's team responding to a Buzzfeed report. Buzzfeed claimed that Trump told Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Tower deal. Mueller's spokesperson, Peter Carr, said Buzzfeed's description was inaccurate. Buzzfeed stands by their report, saying they've re-confirmed it and found no inaccuracies. The article also mentions that Mueller's statement didn't directly deny Trump's involvement or mention the Moscow deal. Democrats like Feinstein and Schiff are reacting, suggesting impeachment if the allegations are true. Trump, on the other hand, claims he's innocent and accuses Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time.

So, the key points are: Buzzfeed's report, Mueller's response, Buzzfeed's defense, the implications for Trump, and the reactions from Democrats and Trump himself. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Buzzfeed's report and Mueller's response, then note that Mueller didn't directly deny Trump's involvement. Then, mention Buzzfeed's defense and the political reactions, including Democrats' calls for accountability and Trump's defense. I should keep it concise, making sure each sentence covers a main point without getting too detailed.
