SUMMARY:

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team has disputed BuzzFeed's report claiming President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower deal in Moscow. Mueller's team stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements, documents, and testimony obtained by the office was inaccurate. However, the statement did not directly dispute that Trump had directed Cohen to lie to Congress. BuzzFeed stands by its reporting, citing two federal law enforcement officials and multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization. The report sparked outrage among Democrats, with some calling for impeachment or criminal charges if the allegations proved true. Sen. Dianne Feinstein stated that if true, the president committed a crime and must be held accountable. The House Intelligence Committee has begun searching for witnesses and documents to confirm the report. The incident raises questions about Trump's potential obstruction of justice and his ties to Russia.
