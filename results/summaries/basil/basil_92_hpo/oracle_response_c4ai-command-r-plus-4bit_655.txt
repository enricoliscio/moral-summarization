SUMMARY: A statement from special counsel Robert Mueller's team on Friday disputed parts of a BuzzFeed report that claimed President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow. Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, said that BuzzFeed's "description" and "characterization" of statements, documents, and testimony obtained by the special counsel's office were inaccurate. However, the statement did not directly address whether Trump ordered Cohen to lie, nor did it mention the Moscow deal. BuzzFeed has stood by its reporting and asked Mueller's office to clarify its dispute. The original report suggested that Trump may have obstructed justice, leading to calls from Democrats for Mueller to release information about the Moscow deal and for possible impeachment proceedings. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff both threatened serious action, including impeachment, if the allegations are proven true. The House Intelligence Committee is already working to secure additional testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal. Trump has denied the allegations, accusing Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time.
END OF SUMMARY.
