SUMMARY: BuzzFeed News reported on Thursday that President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project, citing federal law enforcement officials and evidence obtained by Mueller's office. The report suggested that Trump may have obstructed justice, leading to calls for impeachment by Democrats. Mueller's office released a rare statement disputing BuzzFeed's "description" and "characterization" of the evidence, without specifically denying that Trump directed Cohen to lie. BuzzFeed stands by its reporting and has re-confirmed its accuracy. The statement from Mueller's office adds confusion to the ongoing investigation and raises questions about the extent of Trump's involvement in the Moscow project. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and other Democrats have threatened serious consequences, including impeachment, if the allegations are proven true. The House Intelligence Committee is seeking additional evidence to confirm BuzzFeed's report. President Trump has denied any wrongdoing and accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The situation underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in the president's conduct, with potential implications for national security and the integrity of the justice system.
