SUMMARY:

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report that President Donald Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements, documents, and testimony was "not accurate." However, the statement did not directly dispute that Trump had directed Cohen to lie, nor did it mention the Trump Tower deal in Moscow. Democrats, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff, have called for serious action, including impeachment, if the allegations prove true. Feinstein stated that if true, the president committed a crime and must be held accountable. Schiff's committee has already begun searching for witnesses and documents to confirm BuzzFeed's report. Trump has maintained his innocence, accusing Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The controversy highlights the ongoing investigation into Trump's ties to Russia and raises questions about potential obstruction of justice.

END OF SUMMARY.
