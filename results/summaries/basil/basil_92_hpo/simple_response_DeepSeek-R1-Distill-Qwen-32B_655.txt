Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully. 

The article is about Robert Mueller's team disputing BuzzFeed's report that Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress. Mueller's spokesperson said BuzzFeed's description and characterization were inaccurate. However, Mueller's office didn't directly deny Trump's involvement. 

BuzzFeed stands by their reporting, which has caused a stir among Democrats, suggesting possible impeachment or criminal charges. Feinstein and Schiff are leading the charge, with Schiff's committee already gathering evidence. Trump, on the other hand, claims he's innocent and accuses Cohen of lying to reduce his sentence.

I need to capture the key points: Mueller's response, BuzzFeed's stance, the political implications, and Trump's defense. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral implications, like obstruction of justice and potential impeachment. I'll structure it to show the conflict between Mueller's statement and BuzzFeed's report, the reactions from both sides, and the ongoing investigation.

Let me make sure I include all the important elements without getting too bogged down in details. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens. I think that's a solid approach.
