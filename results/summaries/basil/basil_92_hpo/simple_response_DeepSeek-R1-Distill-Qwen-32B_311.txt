Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Hmm, the article is about Robert Mueller's team disputing a BuzzFeed report regarding Trump directing Cohen to lie to Congress. I need to make sure the summary captures the key points without losing the moral implications.

First, I should identify the main elements: Mueller's response, BuzzFeed's claims, the political reactions, and Trump's defense. I need to present these in a concise manner, keeping under 200 words.

I'll start by mentioning Mueller's denial of BuzzFeed's report. Then, explain what BuzzFeed claimed, including the sources and Cohen's acknowledgment. Next, note the political reactions, especially from Democrats like Feinstein and Schiff, emphasizing the potential for impeachment. Finally, include Trump's defense that Cohen is lying to reduce his sentence.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, highlighting the conflict between Mueller's office and BuzzFeed, the political implications, and the ongoing investigation. I must preserve the moral framing, so I'll focus on the accusations of obstruction of justice and the potential consequences if true.

Let me structure it step by step: introduce Mueller's denial, describe BuzzFeed's report, mention the political responses, and conclude with Trump's stance. Keeping each part brief to stay within the word limit.

I think that covers all the necessary points while maintaining the moral context. Time to put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team denied BuzzFeed's report that President Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower in Moscow. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements, documents, and testimony was inaccurate, though it did not directly dispute Trump's alleged directive. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, citing multiple sources, including interviews and internal documents. The report has sparked political turmoil, with Democrats like Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff calling for accountability and impeachment if the allegations are true. Feinstein emphasized that if Trump lied to Congress, it would constitute a crime. Trump, meanwhile, accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The investigation into Trump's ties to Russia continues, with Mueller's office's exact knowledge remaining unclear. END OF SUMMARY.
