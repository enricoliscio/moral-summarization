SUMMARY: In a rare statement, special counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed parts of a BuzzFeed report that claimed President Donald Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow. Mueller's office did not directly deny that Trump ordered Cohen to lie, but took issue with how BuzzFeed characterized the evidence it had obtained. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting and asked Mueller's office for clarification. The original report sparked outrage among Democrats, with some calling for impeachment proceedings if the allegations are true. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff, prominent members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, respectively, made strong statements condemning the president's actions, if proven true. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The statement from Mueller's office adds to the confusion surrounding the ongoing investigation into Trump's ties with Russia and raises questions about the accuracy of media reports. 

END OF SUMMARY.
