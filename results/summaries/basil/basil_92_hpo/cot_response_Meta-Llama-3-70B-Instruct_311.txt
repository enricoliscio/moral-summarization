SUMMARY:
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report that President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. The team claimed that BuzzFeed's description of statements and characterization of documents and testimony were inaccurate. However, the statement did not directly dispute that Trump had directed Cohen to lie, nor did it mention the Trump Tower deal in Moscow. The report sparked a furor among Democrats, who threatened serious action, including impeachment, if the allegations proved true. Sen. Dianne Feinstein stated that if true, the president committed a crime and must be held accountable. Rep. Adam Schiff revealed that his committee had already begun searching for witnesses and documents to confirm the report. Trump maintained his innocence and accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The dispute has added more confusion to the ongoing investigation into Trump's ties to Russia. END OF SUMMARY.
