SUMMARY:
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report claiming President Donald Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower deal in Moscow. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements, documents, and testimony was inaccurate. However, the statement did not directly dispute that Trump had directed Cohen to lie, nor did it mention the Trump Tower deal. The report sparked outrage among Democrats, with some calling for impeachment or criminal charges if the allegations proved true. Senator Dianne Feinstein stated that if the reports were true, the president committed a crime and must be held accountable. The House Intelligence Committee has already begun searching for witnesses and documents to confirm the report. Trump has maintained he is innocent and accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The controversy has added more confusion to Mueller's ongoing investigation into Trump's ties to Russia. END OF SUMMARY.
