SUMMARY:

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team has disputed BuzzFeed's report that President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements to the office and characterization of documents and testimony obtained were inaccurate. BuzzFeed's report, citing two federal law enforcement officials, claimed that Trump directed Cohen to lie about negotiations over a Trump Tower in Moscow. However, Mueller's statement did not directly dispute this claim. Democrats on Capitol Hill have called for Mueller to release what his team knows about Trump's Moscow deal, with some threatening impeachment or criminal charges if the allegations prove true. Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, revealed that his committee has already begun searching for witnesses and documents to confirm BuzzFeed's report. Trump has maintained his innocence and accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time.

END OF SUMMARY.
