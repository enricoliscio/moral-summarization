SUMMARY: Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office disputed a BuzzFeed report claiming that President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow. Mueller's spokesman said that the report's description of statements, documents, and testimony obtained by the office was inaccurate, but did not directly address whether Trump directed Cohen to lie. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting and asked the Special Counsel's office for clarification. The report sparked calls for impeachment from Democrats, who are seeking more information from Mueller on the matter. Rep. Adam Schiff announced that the House Intelligence Committee is investigating the matter further. The incident adds confusion to Mueller's investigation into Trump's ties with Russia.
END OF SUMMARY.
