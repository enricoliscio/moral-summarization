SUMMARY:

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report claiming President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower deal in Moscow. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements, documents, and testimony obtained by the office was inaccurate. However, the statement did not directly dispute that Trump had directed Cohen to lie, nor did it mention the Trump Tower deal. Democrats on Capitol Hill are outraged, with some calling for impeachment or criminal charges if the allegations prove true. Sen. Dianne Feinstein stated that if the allegations are true, the president committed a crime and must be held accountable. The House Intelligence Committee has already begun searching for witnesses and documents to confirm the report. The moral implication is clear: if Trump directed Cohen to lie, it would be a serious abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and he must be held accountable.

END OF SUMMARY.
