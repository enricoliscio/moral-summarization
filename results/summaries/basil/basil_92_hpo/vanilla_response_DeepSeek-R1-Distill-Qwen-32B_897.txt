Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Robert Mueller's team disputing BuzzFeed's report that Trump told Cohen to lie to Congress. Mueller's spokesperson said BuzzFeed's description of statements and documents was inaccurate. But Mueller didn't directly deny Trump's involvement. 

BuzzFeed's report claims they got info from witnesses and documents, including emails and texts. They said Cohen admitted to following Trump's orders. The article mentions that Democrats are upset, thinking this could lead to impeachment. Feinstein and Schiff are involved, with Schiff's committee looking into it. Trump, on the other hand, says he's innocent and accuses Cohen of lying to reduce his sentence.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Mueller's team disputed the report. Then mention the specifics BuzzFeed reported, the Democrats' reactions, and Trump's defense. Keep it concise, making sure to include all key points without going over the word limit.
