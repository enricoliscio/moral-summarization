Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Robert Mueller's team disputing Buzzfeed's report. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Mueller's team issued a rare statement disputing Buzzfeed's report that Trump told Cohen to lie to Congress. Buzzfeed had claimed that Mueller's office found evidence through interviews and documents that Trump directed Cohen to lie about the Moscow Tower deal. Mueller's spokesperson, Peter Carr, said Buzzfeed's description and characterization were inaccurate, but didn't directly deny Trump's involvement. 

Buzzfeed's editor-in-chief, Ben Smith, stood by their reporting and asked Mueller to clarify. The article also mentions that Democrats, like Feinstein and Schiff, are reacting strongly, suggesting possible impeachment if the allegations are true. Feinstein called for Mueller to release information, and Schiff's committee is looking into it. Trump, on the other hand, claims he's innocent and accuses Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time.

So, the main points are: Mueller's team disputed Buzzfeed's report, Buzzfeed stands by their story, Democrats are reacting with possible impeachment, and Trump denies any wrongdoing. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include all these elements without getting too detailed.

I should structure it by first stating Mueller's dispute, then Buzzfeed's response, followed by the political reactions, and finally Trump's defense. I need to keep it concise but comprehensive.

Let me try to put it all together, making sure each sentence covers a key point without overlapping too much. I should avoid jargon and keep the language clear. Also, I need to make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

I think I have all the necessary elements. Let me draft it out.
