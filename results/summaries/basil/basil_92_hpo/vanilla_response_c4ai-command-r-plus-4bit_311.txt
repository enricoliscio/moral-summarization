SUMMARY: On Thursday, BuzzFeed reported that President Trump directed his former attorney, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow. The report cited anonymous sources and claimed that Mueller's investigation had evidence of this, including emails, texts, and documents. BuzzFeed's report caused a stir among Democrats, with some calling for impeachment proceedings if the allegations were true. However, Mueller's office issued a rare statement disputing BuzzFeed's report, saying that the description of statements and characterization of documents were inaccurate. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting and asked Mueller's office for clarification. The special counsel's statement did not directly address whether Trump directed Cohen to lie, and Democrats continue to push for more information on the matter. The controversy surrounding the BuzzFeed report highlights the ongoing tensions between the President and those investigating his ties to Russia.
