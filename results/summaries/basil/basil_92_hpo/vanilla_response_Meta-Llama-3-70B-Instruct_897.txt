SUMMARY:

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report that President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower deal in Moscow. Mueller's spokesman said the report's description of statements to the office and characterization of documents and testimony were inaccurate. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, citing two federal law enforcement officials and multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization. Democrats on Capitol Hill called for Mueller to release what his team knows about the Moscow deal, with some threatening impeachment or criminal charges if the allegations prove true. Trump maintained his innocence, accusing Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The dispute adds confusion to Mueller's ongoing investigation into Trump's ties to Russia.

END OF SUMMARY.
