SUMMARY:

The special counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report that President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower deal in Moscow. Mueller's team stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements, documents, and testimony obtained by the office was inaccurate. However, the statement did not directly dispute that Trump directed Cohen to lie, nor did it mention the Trump Tower deal. Democrats on Capitol Hill are outraged, with some calling for impeachment or criminal charges if the allegations prove true. Sen. Dianne Feinstein threatened serious action, including impeachment, if the allegations are confirmed, stating that if true, the president committed a crime and must be held accountable. The House Intelligence Committee has already begun searching for witnesses and documents to confirm the report. Trump maintains his innocence, accusing Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time.

END OF SUMMARY.
