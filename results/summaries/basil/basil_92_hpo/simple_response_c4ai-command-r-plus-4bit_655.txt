SUMMARY: In a rare statement, special counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report that President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow deal. Mueller's office did not directly deny that Trump told Cohen to lie, but disputed BuzzFeed's "description" and "characterization" of statements, documents, and testimony obtained by the investigation. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting and asked Mueller's office for clarification. The report sent Democrats into a frenzy, with some threatening impeachment if the allegations are true. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff called for further investigation, while Trump maintained his innocence and accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The statement from Mueller's office adds confusion to the ongoing investigation and raises questions about the accuracy of BuzzFeed's reporting. It remains unclear whether Trump directed Cohen to lie, but the potential implications for obstruction of justice are serious and warrant further scrutiny. The public deserves to know the truth about any potential wrongdoing by the President, and Mueller's investigation must continue unimpeded to uncover the facts. The integrity of our democratic institutions and the rule of law are at stake.
END OF SUMMARY.
