Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words in the text, then write a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll go through the article to pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "directed," "lie," "explosive," "dispute," "untrue," "confusion," "investigation," "obstruction," "impeachment," "crime," "accountable," "counterintelligence," "magnitude," "interfere," "innocent," "accused," "deception," "justify," and "misleading." These words are key because they convey judgment or moral implications.

Next, I'll structure the summary. It needs to be under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: Mueller's team disputing BuzzFeed's report, the claims about Trump directing Cohen to lie, the ongoing investigation, the Democrats' reactions, and Trump's defense. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words where appropriate to maintain the original tone.

I should start by mentioning Mueller's dispute, then theBuzzFeed report's claims, the Democrats' calls for accountability, and Trump's denial. I'll end with the ongoing investigation and the political implications. Keeping it concise but covering all critical points is essential.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's content while highlighting the moral aspects. I'll avoid adding any extra information not present in the original text. Also, I'll make sure the summary doesn't exceed the word limit, so I'll be brief but comprehensive.

Alright, putting it all together, I'll start with the main actors and their actions, then move on to the implications and reactions. This should cover the necessary points and maintain the moral framing as required.

**SUMMARY:**  
Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team disputed BuzzFeed’s report claiming President Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower in Moscow deal. Mueller’s office denied BuzzFeed’s characterization of statements, documents, and testimony but did not directly deny Trump’s alleged instructions. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, which suggested Trump may have obstructed justice, sparking calls for impeachment from Democrats. Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein and House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff emphasized the need for accountability and further investigation. Trump denied the allegations, accusing Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The ongoing investigation into Trump’s ties to Russia remains a critical counterintelligence concern, with political tensions escalating as the story unfolds. END OF SUMMARY.
