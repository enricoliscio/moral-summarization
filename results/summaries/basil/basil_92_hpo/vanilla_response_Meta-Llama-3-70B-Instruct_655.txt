SUMMARY:

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed a BuzzFeed report that claimed President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower deal in Moscow. Mueller's spokesman said the report's description of statements to the office and characterization of documents and testimony were inaccurate. BuzzFeed stands by its reporting, citing two federal law enforcement officials and multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization. The report sparked outrage among Democrats, with some calling for impeachment or criminal charges if the allegations are true. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff threatened serious action, including impeachment, and announced investigations into the matter. Trump has denied the allegations, accusing Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time.

END OF SUMMARY.
