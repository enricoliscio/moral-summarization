Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two main steps: first, identifying all single words with moral connotations, and then writing a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral implications. Words like "disputed," "explosive," "directed," "lie," "confusion," "investigation," "ordered," "acknowledged," "sources," "inaccurate," "fury," "obstruction," "impeachment," "criminal," "innocent," "accused," "lying," "reduce," "jail," "counterintelligence," "magnitude," "interfere," "determined," "follow," "lead," "commit," "crime," "accountable," "searching," "confirm," "deception," and "cover-up" all seem to carry moral weight.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article, making sure to include these morally charged words. The summary should be under 200 words and retain the essence of the moral framing. I'll start by mentioning Mueller's team disputing BuzzFeed's report, then touch on the claims about Trump directing Cohen to lie. I'll include the reactions from Democrats, the investigation by the House committee, Trump's defense, and the ongoing scrutiny. This way, I cover the key points and maintain the moral elements throughout.

**SUMMARY:**

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team disputed BuzzFeed’s explosive report claiming President Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower in Moscow deal. Mueller’s office denied BuzzFeed’s description of statements and documents, but did not directly deny Trump’s involvement in ordering Cohen to lie. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, citing multiple sources and internal documents. The report sparked fury among Democrats, with Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff calling for Mueller to release information and investigate potential obstruction of justice or criminal charges. Trump denied the allegations, accusing Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The investigation into Trump’s ties to Russia and the Moscow deal continues, with ongoing scrutiny of potential deception and cover-up. END OF SUMMARY.
