SUMMARY:
BuzzFeed published an *explosive* report claiming President Trump instructed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower deal in Moscow. The Special Counsel's office *disputed* the report, saying BuzzFeed's *characterization* of their evidence was *inaccurate*. The statement from Mueller's office added to the *confusion* surrounding the investigation. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting and asked the Special Counsel to clarify their statement. Democrats on Capitol Hill threatened serious consequences, including impeachment, if the allegations were true. They called on Mueller to release information about the Moscow deal. President Trump maintained his *innocence* and accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The incident highlights the ongoing *misleading* nature of the investigation, with the truth still unclear.
END OF SUMMARY.
