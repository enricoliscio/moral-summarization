SUMMARY: BuzzFeed News reported on Thursday that President Donald Trump directed his former attorney, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow, citing law enforcement officials and documents obtained by the special counsel's office. The report suggested that Trump may have obstructed justice, leading to calls for impeachment by top Democrats. However, in a rare statement, the special counsel's office disputed BuzzFeed's reporting, stating that their description and characterization of the evidence were inaccurate. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting and asked the special counsel to clarify its statement, while Democrats continued to push for further investigation and threatened serious consequences for the president if the allegations are true. This incident highlights the importance of accurate and responsible reporting, especially when dealing with matters of national significance and potential criminal conduct by the president. The public deserves the truth, and it is the duty of journalists and lawmakers to uncover and expose any wrongdoing, holding those in power accountable for their actions. END OF SUMMARY.
