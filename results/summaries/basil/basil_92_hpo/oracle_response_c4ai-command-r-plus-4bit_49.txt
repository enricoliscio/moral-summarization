SUMMARY: In a rare statement, special counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report that President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow. Mueller's office claimed that BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents were inaccurate. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting and asked the special counsel to clarify its statement, but Mueller's office did not directly address the allegation that Trump ordered Cohen to lie. The report suggested that Trump may have obstructed justice, leading to calls for impeachment or criminal charges if the allegations are true. Democrats on Capitol Hill demanded that Mueller release information about the Moscow deal, with Sen. Dianne Feinstein threatening serious action, including impeachment, if the president is found to have committed a crime. The House Intelligence Committee is also seeking additional witness testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The conflicting statements from Mueller's office and BuzzFeed have added confusion to the ongoing investigation into Trump's ties with Russia.
END OF SUMMARY.
