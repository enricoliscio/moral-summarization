SUMMARY: BuzzFeed News reported on Thursday that President Donald Trump directed his former attorney, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about negotiations regarding a Trump Tower in Moscow. This report, which cited federal law enforcement officials and internal documents, suggested that Trump may have obstructed justice and provided grounds for impeachment. However, the special counsel's office disputed BuzzFeed's report, stating that their description and characterization of the information obtained were inaccurate. The statement from the special counsel's office did not directly address whether Trump directed Cohen to lie, and BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, asking the special counsel to clarify their statement. Democrats on Capitol Hill have threatened serious action, including impeachment, if the allegations are true. The House Intelligence Committee is already working to secure additional testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal. President Trump has maintained his innocence and accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. This incident adds confusion to the ongoing investigation into Trump's ties with Russia and raises questions about the accuracy of media reports and the potential misuse of power.
END OF SUMMARY.
