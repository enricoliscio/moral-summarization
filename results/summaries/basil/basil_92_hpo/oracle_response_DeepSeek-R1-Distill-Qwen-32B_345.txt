Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has given me a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about a statement from Robert Mueller's team disputing Buzzfeed's report that Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress. Buzzfeed's report was based on interviews and documents. Mueller's office didn't directly deny Trump's involvement but said Buzzfeed's description was inaccurate. Buzzfeed stood by their reporting, and Democrats are reacting, possibly leading to impeachment discussions. Trump claims Cohen is lying to get a shorter sentence.

Now, I need to identify the key points and include the moral words. The main points are: Mueller disputes Buzzfeed's report, Buzzfeed stands by their story, Democrats' reactions, and Trump's defense.

I should structure the summary to include words like "directed," "lie," "inaccurate," "orders," "acknowledge," "obstructed," "impeachment," "crime," "secure," "interfere," etc. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral implications.

I'll start by stating Mueller's dispute, then Buzzfeed's response, followed by the Democrats' actions, and end with Trump's defense. I'll make sure to use the moral words to frame each part.

Let me draft it:

Mueller's team disputed Buzzfeed's report that Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress. Buzzfeed's report was based on interviews and documents, but Mueller said it was inaccurate. Buzzfeed stands by their story, asking for clarification. Democrats are reacting, considering impeachment if the allegations are true. Trump claims Cohen is lying to reduce his jail time.

Wait, that's too short. I need to include more details, like the specifics of the report, the response from Democrats, and the implications.

Let me try again, ensuring I include the moral words:

Mueller's team challenged Buzzfeed's report, which alleged Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow deal. Buzzfeed's report was based on interviews and documents, but Mueller's office called it inaccurate. Buzzfeed stood by their reporting, urging Mueller to clarify. Democrats, including Feinstein and Schiff, are considering serious action, including impeachment, if the allegations are true. Trump denies the claims, accusing Cohen of lying to reduce his sentence.

That's better. I included "directed," "lie," "inaccurate," "directed," "Moscow deal," "action," "impeachment," and "lying." I think that covers the moral framing adequately. Let me check the word count. It's around 100 words, so I can add more details if needed without exceeding 200.

Maybe include that Mueller's statement didn't directly deny Trump's orders but focused on Buzzfeed's description. Also, mention that Democrats are seeking more evidence.

Final version:

Mueller's team disputed Buzzfeed's report that Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow deal, calling Buzzfeed's description inaccurate. Buzzfeed stands by their story, based on interviews and documents, urging Mueller to clarify. Democrats, including Feinstein and Schiff, are considering serious action, including impeachment, if the allegations of obstruction of justice are true. Trump denies the claims, accusing Cohen of lying to reduce his sentence.

That should cover the main points with the required moral words.
