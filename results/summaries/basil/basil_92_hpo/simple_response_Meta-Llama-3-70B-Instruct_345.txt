SUMMARY:

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report claiming President Donald Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow deal. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements, documents, and testimony was inaccurate. However, the statement did not directly dispute that Trump directed Cohen to lie, nor did it mention the Trump Tower deal. Democrats on Capitol Hill are outraged, with some calling for impeachment or criminal charges if the allegations prove true. Sen. Dianne Feinstein threatened serious action, stating that if true, the president committed a crime and must be held accountable. The House Intelligence Committee has begun searching for witnesses and documents to confirm the report. The incident raises questions about Trump's ties to Russia and potential obstruction of justice. The moral framing of the article emphasizes the importance of accountability and the potential gravity of Trump's actions.
