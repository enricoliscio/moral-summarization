SUMMARY:
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report that President Donald Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. The report claimed that Trump ordered Cohen to misrepresent negotiations over a Trump Tower in Moscow, which could be a crime and grounds for impeachment or criminal charges. Democrats, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff, called for accountability and threatened serious action, including impeachment, if the allegations proved true. Trump maintained his innocence and accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The dispute adds to the confusion over what Mueller's team knows about Trump's ties to Russia. BuzzFeed stands by its reporting, and Democrats are determined to get to the bottom of the matter. END OF SUMMARY.
