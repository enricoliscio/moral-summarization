SUMMARY: BuzzFeed reported on Thursday that President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow, citing federal law enforcement officials and documents obtained by Mueller's office. The special counsel's office issued a rare statement on Friday, disputing BuzzFeed's "description" and "characterization" of the information it obtained as inaccurate. However, the statement did not directly address whether Trump ordered Cohen to lie or mention the Moscow deal. Democrats on Capitol Hill have reacted strongly to the allegations, with some calling for impeachment or criminal charges if the claims are true. BuzzFeed stands by its reporting and has asked the special counsel's office for clarification. The report has also prompted the House Intelligence Committee to seek additional witness testimony and documents related to the Moscow deal. President Trump has denied any wrongdoing and accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. 

END OF SUMMARY.
