SUMMARY: 
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team has issued a rare statement disputing an explosive report by BuzzFeed that claimed President Donald Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow. Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, called BuzzFeed's description of statements, documents, and testimony "inaccurate," creating confusion over the extent of Mueller's knowledge of Trump's Russia ties. BuzzFeed's report, citing law enforcement officials and documents, alleged that Trump ordered Cohen to lie, which could constitute obstruction of justice and provide grounds for impeachment or criminal charges. Top Democrats, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff, have threatened serious consequences if the allegations are proven true, with Feinstein stating that "the president committed a crime and must be held accountable." BuzzFeed stands by its reporting and has asked Mueller's office for clarification. Trump has accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time and maintains his innocence. 

END OF SUMMARY.
