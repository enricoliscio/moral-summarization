SUMMARY: 
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team has disputed an explosive report by BuzzFeed, which claimed that President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements, documents, and testimony it obtained was inaccurate, creating confusion over the ongoing investigation into Trump's ties with Russia. The report suggested possible obstruction of justice by Trump, leading to calls for impeachment or criminal charges if the allegations are true. BuzzFeed stands by its reporting, while Mueller's office has not directly disputed the claim that Trump directed Cohen to lie, nor mentioned the Moscow deal specifically. Democrats have threatened serious action, with Senator Dianne Feinstein stating that if true, the president must be held accountable for committing a crime. Meanwhile, Trump has maintained his innocence, accusing Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. 

END OF SUMMARY.
