SUMMARY: 

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report that President Donald Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower deal in Moscow. Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements and characterization of documents and testimony were inaccurate. However, Mueller's statement did not directly dispute that Trump ordered Cohen to lie, nor did it mention the Trump Tower deal. Democrats on Capitol Hill were outraged, with some calling for impeachment or criminal charges if the allegations proved true. Sen. Dianne Feinstein threatened serious action, stating that if true, the president committed a crime and must be held accountable. Rep. Adam Schiff revealed that his committee had already begun searching for witnesses and documents to confirm BuzzFeed's report, citing it as a counterintelligence concern of the greatest magnitude. Trump maintained his innocence, accusing Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time.

END OF SUMMARY.
