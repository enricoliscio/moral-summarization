SUMMARY: BuzzFeed News reported on Thursday that President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow, citing law enforcement officials and documents. The Special Counsel's office issued a rare statement disputing BuzzFeed's "description" and "characterization" of the evidence, without directly addressing whether Trump directed Cohen to lie. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting and asked the Special Counsel to clarify its statement. The report sparked calls for impeachment from Democrats, including Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Adam Schiff, who are investigating the matter. The incident adds confusion to the ongoing investigation into Trump's ties with Russia.
END OF SUMMARY.
