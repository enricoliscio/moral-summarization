Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article is about Robert Mueller's team disputing BuzzFeed's report that Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress. Mueller's spokesperson said BuzzFeed's description was inaccurate, but didn't directly deny Trump's involvement. BuzzFeed stands by their report, which suggests possible obstruction of justice, leading Democrats to call for impeachment or criminal charges. Mueller's office hasn't clarified further, and Trump claims Cohen lied to reduce his sentence.

I need to capture the moral implications here. TheBuzzFeed report implies Trump may have committed a crime, which is a serious moral issue. The summary should highlight the dispute, theBuzzFeed's claims, Mueller's response, the political reactions, and Trump's defense.

I'll structure the summary to include all these elements concisely, making sure to mention the potential for impeachment and the ongoing investigation. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and includes all necessary elements while maintaining the moral framing from the original text.

SUMMARY: Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team has disputed BuzzFeed’s report alleging President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower in Moscow deal. Mueller’s spokesperson, Peter Carr, criticized BuzzFeed’s “description” of statements and “characterization” of documents, calling them inaccurate. However, the statement did not directly deny Trump’s involvement or address the Moscow deal. BuzzFeed stands by its reporting, which has sparked calls for impeachment from Democrats, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff. Feinstein warned that if Trump indeed directed Cohen to lie, it would constitute a crime. Mueller’s office has not provided further clarification, while Trump maintains his innocence, accusing Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The report has intensified scrutiny over Trump’s potential obstruction of justice and ties to Russia. END OF SUMMARY.
