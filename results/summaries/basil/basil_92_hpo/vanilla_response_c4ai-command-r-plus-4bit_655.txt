SUMMARY: Special counsel Robert Mueller's office issued a rare statement disputing a BuzzFeed report that claimed President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower deal in Moscow. Mueller's spokesman said the report's description and characterization of documents and testimony were inaccurate, but did not directly address whether Trump ordered Cohen to lie. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting and asked Mueller's office for clarification. The original BuzzFeed report suggested that Trump may have obstructed justice, leading to calls from Democrats for Mueller to release information related to the Moscow deal. Ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, stated that if the allegations were true, the president must be held accountable and could face impeachment. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff also announced that his committee was working to secure additional testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal. Meanwhile, President Trump has maintained his innocence and accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. 

END OF SUMMARY.
