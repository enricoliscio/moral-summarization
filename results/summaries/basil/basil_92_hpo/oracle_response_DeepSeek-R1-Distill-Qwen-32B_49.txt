Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. First, I need to understand the article's content. It's about Mueller's team disputing BuzzFeed's report that Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress. The article mentions Mueller's statement, BuzzFeed's response, reactions from Democrats, and Trump's defense.

I should focus on the key points: Mueller's denial, BuzzFeed's stance, the investigation details, Democratic reactions, and Trump's claims. I need to include the morally charged words like "directed," "lie," "inaccurate," "orders," etc. I have to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes those terms to maintain the moral framing.

I'll start by stating Mueller's team denied BuzzFeed's report. Then mention the specifics of the report, like the Moscow deal and the sources Mueller used. Include BuzzFeed's response about standing by their reporting. Then, note the Democratic reactions, including Feinstein and Schiff, and the possible impeachment angle. Finally, mention Trump's defense that Cohen lied to reduce jail time.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the essential points without being too detailed. Also, make sure to use the morally framed words appropriately to reflect the article's tone.

SUMMARY: Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team disputed BuzzFeed’s report that President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow deal. Mueller’s office claimed BuzzFeed’s description of statements, documents, and testimony was inaccurate, though it did not directly deny Trump’s involvement in ordering Cohen to lie. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, which suggested Trump may have obstructed justice, potentially paving the way for impeachment or criminal charges. Democrats, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff, called for accountability and further investigation. Feinstein warned that if Trump indeed directed Cohen to lie, it would constitute a crime. Schiff revealed his committee was already pursuing witnesses and documents to confirm the report. Trump, meanwhile, denied wrongdoing, accusing Cohen of lying to Mueller to reduce his jail time. The ongoing investigation into Trump’s ties to Russia remains shrouded in confusion, with Mueller’s office not clarifying whether Trump’s alleged orders to Cohen were inaccurate. END OF SUMMARY.
