SUMMARY:

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report claiming President Donald Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower deal in Moscow. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements, documents, and testimony was inaccurate. However, the statement did not directly dispute that Trump ordered Cohen to lie, nor did it mention the Trump Tower deal. Democrats on Capitol Hill were outraged, suggesting that Trump may have obstructed justice, providing grounds for impeachment or criminal charges. Sen. Dianne Feinstein threatened serious action, including impeachment, if the allegations proved true, stating that "if true, the president committed a crime and must be held accountable." Rep. Adam Schiff revealed that his committee had begun searching for witnesses and documents to confirm BuzzFeed's report, citing it as a "counterintelligence concern of the greatest magnitude." Trump maintained his innocence, accusing Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time.

END OF SUMMARY.
