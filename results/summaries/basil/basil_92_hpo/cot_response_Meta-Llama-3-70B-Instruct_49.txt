SUMMARY:
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report that President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower deal in Moscow. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements, documents, and testimony obtained by the office was "inaccurate". However, the statement did not directly dispute that Trump had directed Cohen to lie, nor did it mention the Trump Tower deal. Democrats on Capitol Hill were outraged, with Sen. Dianne Feinstein threatening "serious action, including impeachment" if the allegations proved true, stating that if Trump directed Cohen to lie, it would be a "crime" and the president must be "held accountable". Trump maintained his innocence, accusing Cohen of "lying" to reduce his jail time. The controversy has added to the confusion over what Mueller's team knows about Trump's ties to Russia. END OF SUMMARY.
