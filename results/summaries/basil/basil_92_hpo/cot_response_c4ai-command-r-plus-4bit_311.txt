SUMMARY: 
Special counsel Robert Mueller's team has disputed an explosive report by BuzzFeed News, which accused President Donald Trump of directing Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project. Mueller's spokesperson, Peter Carr, stated that BuzzFeed's description and characterization of documents, statements, and testimony obtained by the special counsel's office were inaccurate. BuzzFeed, however, stands by its reporting and has urged Mueller to clarify his statement. The original report suggested that Trump may have obstructed justice, leading to calls for impeachment or criminal charges if the allegations are proved true. Top Democrats, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff, have threatened serious action, with Feinstein stating that "if true, the president committed a crime and must be held accountable." Trump has maintained his innocence and accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The special counsel's statement adds confusion to the ongoing investigation into Trump's ties with Russia, as it does not directly dispute the allegation that Trump directed Cohen to lie nor does it mention the Moscow project. 
END OF SUMMARY.
