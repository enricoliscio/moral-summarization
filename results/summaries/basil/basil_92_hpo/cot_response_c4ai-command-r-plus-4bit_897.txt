SUMMARY: 
Special counsel Robert Mueller's team issued a rare statement disputing an explosive report by BuzzFeed that claimed President Donald Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow deal. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements, documents, and testimony it obtained was inaccurate, creating confusion around Mueller's knowledge of Trump's ties to Russia. BuzzFeed's report alleged that Trump directed Cohen to lie, which could constitute obstruction of justice and provide grounds for criminal charges or impeachment. Top Democrats, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff, threatened serious action against Trump if the allegations were true, while Trump maintained his innocence and accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, urging Mueller to clarify his statement. The special counsel's statement did not directly dispute Trump's involvement in directing Cohen to lie nor did it mention the Moscow deal, adding to the confusion and raising questions about the accuracy of BuzzFeed's reporting.
END OF SUMMARY.
