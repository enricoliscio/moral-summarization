SUMMARY: Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team issued a rare statement disputing BuzzFeed's report that claimed President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow. Mueller's spokesman called the report's description of statements, documents, and testimony obtained by the office "not accurate." BuzzFeed stood by its reporting and asked the special counsel to clarify its statement. The dispute adds confusion to Mueller's investigation into Trump's ties with Russia. Democrats threatened serious action, including impeachment, if the allegations are true, while Trump maintained his innocence and accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The House Intelligence Committee is searching for witnesses and documents to confirm the report.
END OF SUMMARY.
