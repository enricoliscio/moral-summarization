Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants it to be concise, under 200 words, and to include the key points without losing the essence of the story. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Mueller's team disputing BuzzFeed's report that Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress. The article mentions the confusion around Mueller's investigation, the details from BuzzFeed about Trump's orders, and the reactions from Democrats and Trump himself.

I should highlight the dispute between Mueller's office and BuzzFeed, the specifics of the report, and the political implications. It's important to note that Mueller didn't directly deny Trump's involvement but focused on the accuracy of the report. Also, the Democrats' reactions and their calls for accountability are crucial for the moral framing.

I need to keep the summary clear and to the point, making sure each key element is included without going into too much detail. I'll structure it to start with the dispute, then theBuzzFeed's claims, Mueller's response, the political reactions, and end with Trump's defense.

I should ensure that the moral implications are clear, such as the potential obstruction of justice and the calls for impeachment. This will help maintain the original framing from the article.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows logically from one point to the next. I'll avoid any unnecessary details to keep it concise.

SUMMARY: Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report claiming President Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower in Moscow. Mueller's spokesperson, Peter Carr, stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements and documents was inaccurate, though he did not directly deny Trump's involvement. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, asserting it had re-confirmed its sources and found no inaccuracies. The report has sparked political controversy, with Democrats like Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff calling for accountability and impeachment if the allegations are true. Feinstein emphasized that if Trump indeed directed Cohen to lie, it would constitute a crime. Trump, meanwhile, has maintained his innocence, accusing Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. The investigation into Trump's potential obstruction of justice continues to unfold, with Mueller's office remaining tight-lipped about its findings. END OF SUMMARY.
