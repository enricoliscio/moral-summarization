SUMMARY:

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report that President Donald Trump directed his attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower deal in Moscow. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements, documents, and testimony obtained by the office was "inaccurate". The report claimed that Trump gave "orders" to Cohen to "lie" about the negotiations, which Cohen "acknowledged" during his interviews with Mueller's office. Democrats on Capitol Hill were outraged, with Sen. Dianne Feinstein threatening "serious action", including "impeachment", if the allegations proved true. Feinstein stated that if Trump "directed" Cohen to "lie", it would be a "crime" and the president must be "held accountable". Rep. Adam Schiff also announced that his committee would "secure" additional witness testimony and documents to confirm the report. Trump, however, maintained his innocence, accusing Cohen of "lying" to reduce his jail time.

END OF SUMMARY.
