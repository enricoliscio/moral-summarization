SUMMARY: BuzzFeed News published a report alleging that President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project, which could constitute obstruction of justice and provide grounds for impeachment. The Special Counsel's office issued a rare statement disputing BuzzFeed's "description" and "characterization" of the evidence, but did not directly address whether Trump directed Cohen to lie. Democrats on Capitol Hill have demanded that Mueller release information about the Moscow deal, threatening serious consequences for Trump if the allegations are true. BuzzFeed stands by its reporting and has asked the Special Counsel to clarify its statement. This incident underscores the importance of accurate and transparent reporting in matters of national security and potential presidential misconduct. The public deserves to know the truth, and those involved must act with integrity and in the best interests of the country. END OF SUMMARY.
