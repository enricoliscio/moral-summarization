SUMMARY:

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report claiming President Donald Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about Trump Tower Moscow negotiations. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements, documents, and testimony was "inaccurate". However, the statement did not directly dispute that Trump ordered Cohen to lie, nor did it mention the Trump Tower deal. Democrats, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff, called for action, including impeachment, if the allegations proved true. Feinstein stated that if Trump directed Cohen to lie, it would be a "crime" and the president must be "held accountable". Trump maintained his innocence, accusing Cohen of "lying" to reduce his jail time. The controversy adds confusion to Mueller's ongoing investigation into Trump's ties to Russia. BuzzFeed stands by its reporting, urging Mueller's office to clarify its statement.

END OF SUMMARY.
