SUMMARY:

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team has disputed a BuzzFeed report that claimed President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a Trump Tower deal in Moscow. Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements to the office and characterization of documents and testimony obtained were "not accurate." BuzzFeed stands by its reporting, citing two federal law enforcement officials and multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization. The report sparked outrage among Democrats, with some calling for impeachment or criminal charges if the allegations are true. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff have threatened serious action, including impeachment, if the allegations are proven. Trump has maintained his innocence, accusing Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time.

END OF SUMMARY.
