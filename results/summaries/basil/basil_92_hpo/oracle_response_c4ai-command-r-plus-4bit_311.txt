SUMMARY: In a rare statement, special counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report that claimed President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow. Mueller's office said BuzzFeed's description of specific statements and characterization of documents and testimony were inaccurate. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting and asked the special counsel to clarify its statement, but Mueller's office did not directly address the allegation that Trump ordered Cohen to lie. The report suggested that Trump may have obstructed justice, leading to calls for impeachment or criminal charges if the allegations are true. Democrats on Capitol Hill are threatening serious action, including impeachment, and are seeking additional witnesses and documents to confirm BuzzFeed's report. The dispute between BuzzFeed and Mueller's office has added confusion to the ongoing investigation into Trump's ties to Russia. Trump has maintained his innocence and accused Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time.
END OF SUMMARY.
