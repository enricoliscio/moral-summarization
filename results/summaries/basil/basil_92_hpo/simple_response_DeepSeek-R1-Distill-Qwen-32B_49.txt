Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Mueller's team disputing BuzzFeed's report that Trump told Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow deal. The key points are:

1. Mueller's spokesperson, Peter Carr, says BuzzFeed's description of statements and characterization of documents are inaccurate.
2. BuzzFeed stands by their reporting, citing federal officials and internal documents.
3. The article mentions the potential implications for Trump, like obstruction of justice and impeachment.
4. Democrats, including Feinstein and Schiff, are reacting strongly, suggesting possible legal action.
5. Trump claims Cohen lied to reduce his jail time.

I should make sure the summary highlights the dispute, the moral implications (like lying to Congress), and the political reactions. Keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.
