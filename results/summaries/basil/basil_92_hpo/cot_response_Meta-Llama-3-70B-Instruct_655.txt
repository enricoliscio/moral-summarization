SUMMARY:
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report that President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements, documents, and testimony was "inaccurate". The report claimed that Trump ordered Cohen to lie about negotiations over a Trump Tower in Moscow, which could be considered a "crime" and grounds for "impeachment" or "criminal charges". Democrats, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, called for Mueller to release what his team knows about Trump's Moscow deal as a matter of "public duty". Feinstein stated that if the allegations proved true, the president "committed a crime" and must be "held accountable". Trump maintained his "innocence" and accused Cohen of "lying" to reduce his jail time. The controversy adds more confusion over what Mueller's team knows in its ongoing investigation into Trump's ties to Russia. END OF SUMMARY.
