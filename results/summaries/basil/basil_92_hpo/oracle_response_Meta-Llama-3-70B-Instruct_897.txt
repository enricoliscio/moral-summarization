SUMMARY: 
Special counsel Robert Mueller's team disputed BuzzFeed's report that President Donald Trump directed his attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower deal in Moscow. Mueller's office stated that BuzzFeed's description of statements and characterization of documents and testimony were inaccurate. BuzzFeed stood by its reporting, citing two federal law enforcement officials and multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization, as well as internal company emails, text messages, and documents. The report sparked outrage among Democrats, with some calling for impeachment or criminal charges if Trump's alleged obstruction of justice is proven true. Sen. Dianne Feinstein stated that if the allegations are true, Trump committed a crime and must be held accountable. The House Intelligence Committee has begun searching for witnesses and documents to confirm the report, citing it as a counterintelligence concern of the greatest magnitude. Trump denied the allegations, accusing Cohen of lying to reduce his jail time. 
END OF SUMMARY.
