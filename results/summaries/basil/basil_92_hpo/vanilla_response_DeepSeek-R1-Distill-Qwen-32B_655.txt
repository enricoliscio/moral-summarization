Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Robert Mueller's team responding to a Buzzfeed report. Buzzfeed claimed that Trump told Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Tower deal. Mueller's spokesperson, Peter Carr, said Buzzfeed's description and characterization were inaccurate, but didn't deny Trump directing Cohen to lie. Buzzfeed stands by their reporting. Democrats like Feinstein and Schiff are reacting, calling for accountability and impeachment if true. Trump denies any wrongdoing, blaming Cohen. The summary needs to capture all these points concisely, under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the key elements: Mueller's response, Buzzfeed's stance, Democratic reactions, and Trump's defense. I should structure it clearly, maybe starting with Mueller's statement, then Buzzfeed's response, followed by the political implications and Trump's side. Keeping it brief but comprehensive.
