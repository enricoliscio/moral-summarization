SUMMARY: Republican senators have demanded that party Chairman Michael Steele apologize for his claim that the Afghanistan war may not be winnable and is a "war of Obama's choosing." Sen. Jim DeMint called Steele's comments "unacceptable" and inaccurate, saying he should apologize to the troops as it is "America's war." Sen. John McCain also criticized Steele's remarks as "wildly inaccurate." Steele tried to quell the backlash by issuing a statement affirming America's commitment to winning the war on terror and supporting the troops, but some conservatives, like Bill Kristol, still called for his resignation. Steele's off-the-cuff remarks have caused significant controversy, and some question whether he can still effectively function in his role. This incident highlights the moral duty to support troops and the potential consequences of failing to uphold that duty.
END OF SUMMARY.
