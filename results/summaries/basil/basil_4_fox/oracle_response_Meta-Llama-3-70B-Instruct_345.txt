SUMMARY:

Republican senators are demanding that Party Chairman Michael Steele apologize for his "unacceptable" and "inaccurate" remarks about the war in Afghanistan, which they deem a "war of America's choosing". Steele's claim that the war may not be winnable sparked outrage among conservatives, with some calling for his resignation. Sen. Jim DeMint and Sen. John McCain condemned Steele's comments, saying they were "wildly inaccurate" and needed to be retracted. DeMint emphasized that Steele must apologize to the troops, as this is "America's war" and not "Obama's war". Steele attempted to quell the controversy with a statement reaffirming the importance of winning the "war on terror", but it failed to quiet the backlash. Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol led the charge of conservatives calling for Steele to step down, saying it would be "better if he went".
