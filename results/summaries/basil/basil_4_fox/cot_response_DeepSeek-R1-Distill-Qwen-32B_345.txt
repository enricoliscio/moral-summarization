Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've given me a specific structure to follow, so I need to make sure I adhere to that.

First, I need to identify all the morally framed words in the article. The user mentioned that these are single words, so I'll go through the text and pick out any words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "pressure," "backlash," "resignation," "apologize," "unacceptable," "inaccurate," "refocus," "wildly," "furore," "quell," "confusion," "charge," "better," and "step down" stand out as they carry moral weight.

Next, I have to write a concise summary using these words. The summary needs to be no longer than 200 words and should include as many of the identified morally framed words as possible. I'll start by outlining the main points: Republican senators pressuring Michael Steele, the backlash, calls for resignation, specific quotes from DeMint and McCain, Steele's attempt to apologize, and the ongoing controversy.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well while incorporating the moral terms. I'll mention the pressure from senators, the backlash, the demand for an apology, the characterization of Steele's comments as unacceptable and inaccurate, and the ongoing calls for his resignation. I'll also include how Steele tried to quell the furor but it didn't help.

I should make sure the summary is clear and sticks to the key events without adding unnecessary details. Also, I need to keep it within the word limit, so I'll be concise with each point.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to start with the main issue, then the reactions from the senators, Steele's response, and the ongoing criticism. This should cover all the necessary points while preserving the moral framing as per the user's instructions.

**SUMMARY:**  
Republican senators pressured RNC Chairman Michael Steele to apologize for his controversial remarks calling Afghanistan a "war of Obama's choosing" and possibly unwinnable. Prominent conservatives, including Sen. Jim DeMint, demanded Steele apologize to the troops, stating the war is America's, not Obama's. DeMint criticized Steele's comments as "unacceptable" and "inaccurate," calling for a chairman focused on the election. Sen. John McCain labeled Steele's remarks "wildly inaccurate" and questioned his ability to continue in his role. Steele attempted to quell the furor with a statement reaffirming the need to win the war on terror, but the controversy persisted. Conservatives like Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol continued to call for Steele's resignation, arguing it would be "better" for him to step down.
