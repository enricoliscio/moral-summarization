SUMMARY:

Republican senators and conservative leaders are calling for GOP Chairman Michael Steele to apologize and potentially resign after his remarks on Afghanistan, which they deemed "unacceptable" and "wildly inaccurate". Steele claimed that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable, sparking outrage among war-supporting Republicans. Senators Jim DeMint and John McCain led the criticism, with DeMint demanding an apology to the troops and McCain questioning Steele's ability to continue in his role. Despite Steele's attempt to clarify his remarks, the controversy persists, with Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol leading the charge for Steele's resignation. The moral framing of this issue is clear: Steele's comments were seen as a betrayal of the troops and an abandonment of America's commitment to winning the war on terror. His refusal to fully apologize and retract his statements has led to a crisis of trust among his own party members.

END OF SUMMARY.
