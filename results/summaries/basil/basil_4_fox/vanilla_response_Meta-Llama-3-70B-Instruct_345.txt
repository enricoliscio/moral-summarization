SUMMARY:

Republican senators are calling for party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize and clarify his recent comments that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable. Senators Jim DeMint and John McCain, both strong supporters of the war, criticized Steele's remarks as "unacceptable" and "wildly inaccurate". DeMint demanded an apology to the troops, while McCain suggested Steele should assess whether he can still function in his job. Despite Steele's attempt to clarify his statement, the controversy continues, with Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol leading the charge of conservatives calling for Steele's resignation. Steele's comments have sparked a backlash among war-supporting Republicans, who argue that Afghanistan is a critical national security issue that transcends partisan politics.
