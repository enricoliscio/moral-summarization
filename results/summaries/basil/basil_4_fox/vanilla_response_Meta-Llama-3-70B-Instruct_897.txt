SUMMARY:

Republican senators are calling for party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize for his recent comment that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable. Sen. Jim DeMint and Sen. John McCain criticized Steele's remarks as "unacceptable" and "wildly inaccurate," saying that Afghanistan is a war that the US must win. DeMint demanded an apology to the troops, while McCain suggested that Steele assess whether he can still function in his job. Despite Steele's attempt to clarify his remarks, the controversy continues, with Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol leading the charge of conservatives calling for Steele's resignation. Steele's statement, in which he emphasized the importance of winning the war on terror, failed to quell the furor.
