SUMMARY: Republican senators have criticized party Chairman Michael Steele for his comment that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable. Sen. Jim DeMint called for Steele to apologize to the troops, saying that the war in Afghanistan is America's war and not Obama's. DeMint also said that Steele needs to "refocus" on the upcoming election and that his comments were unacceptable and inaccurate. Sen. John McCain also criticized Steele's comments as "wildly inaccurate." Steele issued a statement attempting to clarify his remarks, but the backlash continued, with some conservatives calling for his resignation. Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, who led the charge in calling for Steele's resignation, said that Steele needs to step down despite the chairman's attempts to defend himself.
