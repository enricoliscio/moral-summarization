SUMMARY:

Republican senators are calling for party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize and clarify his recent statement that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable. Senators Jim DeMint and John McCain, both strong supporters of the war, condemned Steele's comments as "unacceptable" and "wildly inaccurate." DeMint demanded an apology to the troops, while McCain suggested Steele assess whether he can still function in his job. Despite Steele's attempt to clarify his remarks with a statement and email to RNC members, the controversy continues. Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, who led the charge against Steele, still believes the chairman should resign. The backlash against Steele's comments has sparked a debate about his leadership and ability to focus on the November election.

END OF SUMMARY.
