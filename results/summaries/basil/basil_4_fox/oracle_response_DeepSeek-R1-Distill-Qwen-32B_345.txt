Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should keep the morally framed words they listed, which are: war, fighting, remarks, win, unacceptable, inaccurate, terror, remark. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Republican senators are pressuring Michael Steele to apologize for his comments about Afghanistan being Obama's war. There's a lot of criticism, with some calling for his resignation. Steele tried to clarify but it didn't calm the controversy.

I need to make sure that in my summary, I include those specific words. I'll structure the summary to highlight the key events: the pressure on Steele, the criticism from senators like DeMint and McCain, the nature of Steele's remarks, and the ongoing controversy.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally. I'll start by stating the pressure on Steele, then mention the remarks and the reactions, including the words like "unacceptable" and "inaccurate." I'll also include Steele's attempt to clarify and the ongoing issue.

I need to make sure not to add any new moral framing words beyond what's provided. I'll focus on the key points and maintain the tone and context from the original article. 

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all the required words are included and the summary stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Republican senators are pressing party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize for his controversial remarks about Afghanistan being "Obama's war" and possibly unwinnable. Prominent conservatives, including Sen. Jim DeMint, have criticized Steele's comments as "unacceptable" and "inaccurate," calling for him to refocus on the November election. DeMint emphasized that the conflict is "America's war," not Obama's, and urged Steele to apologize to the troops. Sen. John McCain also labeled Steele's remarks "wildly inaccurate," suggesting he assess his ability to continue in his role. Steele attempted to quell the controversy by issuing a statement reaffirming the need to "win the war on terror" and support troops, but his efforts failed to calm the furor. Conservatives like Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol continue to call for Steele's resignation, deeming his leadership inadequate. The controversy underscores divisions within the GOP over Steele's leadership and the importance of unity in the run-up to the election. END OF SUMMARY.
