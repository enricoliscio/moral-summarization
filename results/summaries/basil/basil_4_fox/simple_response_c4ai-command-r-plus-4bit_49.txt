SUMMARY: Republican senators and conservative pundits are calling for the resignation of Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele after he claimed that the war in Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing." Steele's comments, which have been deemed "unacceptable" and "inaccurate," have caused a backlash within the party, with many arguing that he needs to apologize to the troops and refocus on the upcoming election. While Steele has issued a statement attempting to clarify his position and support the troops, the controversy continues to grow, with some calling for his resignation. Sen.
