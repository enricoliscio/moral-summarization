Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article talks about Republican senators pressuring Michael Steele to apologize for his remarks about Afghanistan. Steele called it "Obama's war" and suggested it might not be winnable. This upset many conservatives, including DeMint and McCain, who criticized his comments as unacceptable and inaccurate. They want Steele to apologize to the troops and focus on the election. Steele tried to clarify his stance but the backlash continued, with Kristol calling for his resignation.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes the morally framed words: war, fighting, remarks, win, unacceptable, inaccurate, terror, remark. I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflict, the criticism of Steele's remarks, and the calls for his resignation. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is clear.

I'll start by stating the pressure on Steele, mention his remarks, the criticism from senators, and the ongoing controversy. I'll include that Steele attempted to clarify but it didn't help. Finally, I'll note Kristol's stance. That should cover all the key points and the moral elements.

SUMMARY: Republican senators pressured RNC Chairman Michael Steele to apologize for his remarks calling Afghanistan a "war of Obama's choosing" and suggesting it may not be winnable. Critics, including Sen. Jim DeMint and Sen. John McCain, deemed his comments "unacceptable" and "inaccurate," emphasizing that the conflict is "America's war" and must be won. Steele attempted to quell the controversy by stating that "America must win the war on terror" and support troops, but his efforts failed to calm the backlash. Prominent conservatives, like Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, called for Steele's resignation, arguing his remarks were "wildly inaccurate" and he should step down. The controversy highlights divisions within the GOP over leadership and messaging as the party prepares for the November election. END OF SUMMARY.
