Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Republican senators pressuring Michael Steele, their chairman, to apologize for his remarks about the Afghanistan war. Steele called it "Obama's war" and suggested it might not be winnable. This caused a backlash, with some conservatives wanting him to resign. Senators like Jim DeMint and John McCain criticized Steele's comments as unacceptable and inaccurate. Steele tried to clarify, but the controversy continued, with Bill Kristol leading calls for his resignation.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes the morally framed words: war, fighting, remarks, win, unacceptable, inaccurate, terror, remark. I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate.

I should start by identifying the key events: the pressure on Steele, the nature of his remarks, the criticism from senators, his attempt to clarify, and the ongoing controversy.

I'll structure the summary to include all these points, making sure to use the specified moral terms. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the tokens as instructed.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each moral term is included without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count to stay within limits.

SUMMARY: Republican senators criticized RNC Chairman Michael Steele for his remarks calling Afghanistan a "war of Obama's choosing" and questioning its winnability. They demanded an apology, framing his comments as unacceptable and inaccurate. Sen. Jim DeMint emphasized that the war is America's, not Obama's, and urged Steele to refocus on the election. Sen. John McCain called Steele's remarks "wildly inaccurate," while Bill Kristol led calls for his resignation. Steele attempted to quell the furor by stating the U.S. must win the war on terror and support troops, but his efforts did not quiet the controversy. END OF SUMMARY.
