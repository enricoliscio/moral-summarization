SUMMARY:

Republican senators and conservative leaders are calling for Party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize and potentially resign after his recent comments suggesting that the war in Afghanistan is "Obama's war" and may not be winnable. Senators Jim DeMint and John McCain, as well as Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, have condemned Steele's remarks as "unacceptable," "inaccurate," and "wildly inaccurate." They argue that Steele's comments undermine the troops and the war effort, and that he needs to refocus on the November election. Steele has attempted to clarify his remarks, stating that America must win the war on terror, but the controversy has not been quelled. The moral framing of this issue is clear: Steele's comments are seen as a betrayal of the troops and the nation's security, and his refusal to apologize and take responsibility is a failure of leadership.

END OF SUMMARY.
