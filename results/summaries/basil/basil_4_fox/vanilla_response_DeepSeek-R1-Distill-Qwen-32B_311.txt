Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Republican senators pressuring their chairman, Michael Steele, to apologize for his comments about Afghanistan. Steele called it "Obama's war" and suggested it might not be winnable. This caused a backlash, with some conservatives wanting him to resign.

I should identify the key points: Steele's comments, the reaction from senators like DeMint and McCain, their demands for an apology and focus on the election, Steele's attempt to clarify, and the ongoing criticism from Kristol.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include all main elements. I'll structure it to mention the pressure from senators, their specific demands, Steele's response, and the continued criticism.

Let me make sure the summary flows well and covers all important aspects without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Republican senators are pressuring party chairman Michael Steele to apologize for his comments calling Afghanistan a "war of Obama's choosing" and suggesting it may not be winnable. Prominent conservatives, including Sen. Jim DeMint and Sen. John McCain, criticized Steele's remarks, with DeMint stating Steele must apologize to the troops and refocus on the November election. McCain called the comments "wildly inaccurate" and questioned Steele's ability to continue in his role. Steele issued a statement reaffirming the need to win the war on terror and support troops, but his attempt to clarify did little to quell the controversy. Conservative leader Bill Kristol continued to call for Steele's resignation, despite Steele's efforts to convince him otherwise. END OF SUMMARY.
