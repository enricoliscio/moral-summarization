SUMMARY: Republican senators pressured party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize for claiming Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing." Sen. Jim DeMint called Steele's comments "unacceptable" and "inaccurate," saying Steele should apologize to the troops as the war is "America's war." Sen. John McCain also criticized Steele's remarks as "wildly inaccurate." Steele issued a statement affirming the need to win the war on terror but did not directly apologize. Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol led calls for Steele's resignation, though Steele tried to defend himself. Critics argued Steele should step down, citing his history of off-the-cuff remarks and the seriousness of the Afghanistan war issue.
END OF SUMMARY.
