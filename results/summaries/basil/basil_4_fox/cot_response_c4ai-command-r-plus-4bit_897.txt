SUMMARY:
Republican senators are pressuring party Chairman Michael Steele to publicly apologize for his claim that the Afghanistan war may not be winnable and is "a war of Obama's choosing." Some prominent conservatives, including Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, have called for Steele's resignation, deeming his comments *unacceptable* and *inaccurate*. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., demanded an apology to the troops, stating that "This is America's war. It's not Obama's war." Steele, known for his off-the-cuff remarks, issued a statement affirming the need to win the "war on terror" and support the troops. However, his attempts to *quiet* the growing *controversy* fell short as critics deemed his comments *wildly* *inaccurate*. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., suggested Steele assess whether he can still function in his role and make an *appropriate* decision about his future. Steele's future as GOP chairman remains uncertain as some within the party question his ability to lead effectively.
