SUMMARY: Republican senators are demanding that party Chairman Michael Steele publicly apologize for his recent claim that the Afghanistan war may not be winnable and is a "war of Obama's choosing." Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., called Steele's comments "unacceptable" and "inaccurate," arguing that Steele must apologize to the troops as the Afghanistan war is America's war, not Obama's. Sen. John McCain also criticized Steele's remarks as "wildly inaccurate." Steele issued a statement emphasizing the need for America to win the war on terror and provide necessary support to troops, but the backlash continued, with some conservatives calling for his resignation. Bill Kristol, for example, maintained his position that Steele should step down despite Steele's attempts to defend himself. Steele's controversial remarks have caused significant controversy within the Republican Party, with senators and conservatives alike calling for accountability and a refocus on the upcoming election.
