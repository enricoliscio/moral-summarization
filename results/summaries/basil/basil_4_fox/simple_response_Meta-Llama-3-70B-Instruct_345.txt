SUMMARY:

Republican senators and prominent conservatives are calling for party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize and even resign after his comments on Afghanistan, which they deemed "unacceptable" and "inaccurate". Steele claimed that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable, sparking outrage among war-supporting Republicans. Senators Jim DeMint and John McCain, among others, condemned Steele's remarks, saying they were harmful to the troops and the country's efforts in Afghanistan. DeMint emphasized that Afghanistan is "America's war", not Obama's, and that Steele needs to "refocus" on the November election. Despite Steele's attempt to clarify his remarks, the backlash continues, with many calling for his resignation. The moral framing of this issue is clear: Steele's comments were a betrayal of the troops and the country, and he must take responsibility for his words.
