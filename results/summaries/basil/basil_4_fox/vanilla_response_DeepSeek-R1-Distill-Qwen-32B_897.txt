Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand what's going on. The article is about Republican senators pressuring their chairman, Michael Steele, to explain and apologize for his comments about the Afghanistan war. Steele called it "Obama's war" and suggested it might not be winnable. 

Hmm, some prominent conservatives want him to resign. Senator Jim DeMint from South Carolina isn't calling for his resignation but wants an apology to the troops. He emphasizes that it's America's war, not Obama's. DeMint also mentions that Steele needs to refocus on the election and that his comments were unacceptable. 

Then, Senator John McCain from Arizona also criticized Steele, saying his comments were wildly inaccurate and that Steele needs to assess his ability to continue his job. 

Steele tried to calm things down by issuing a statement saying that America must win the war on terror and support the troops. He also sent an email to RNC members hoping to clear up confusion. But it didn't help much because Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, still wants Steele to resign. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Steele's comments, the backlash from senators like DeMint and McCain, Steele's attempt to apologize, and Kristol's continued call for resignation. I'll make sure to keep it concise and cover all the key elements without going into too much detail. 

Let me structure it: Start with the pressure on Steele, mention the comments, then the reactions from DeMint and McCain, Steele's response, and finally Kristol's stance. That should cover the summary effectively.
