SUMMARY:

Republican senators are calling for party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize for his recent comments that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable. Senators Jim DeMint and John McCain, both strong supporters of the war, criticized Steele's remarks as "unacceptable" and "wildly inaccurate". DeMint demanded an apology to the troops, while McCain suggested Steele should assess whether he can still function in his job. Despite Steele's attempts to clarify his remarks, the controversy continued, with Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol leading the charge of conservatives calling for Steele's resignation. Steele's statement, in which he emphasized the importance of winning the war on terror, failed to quell the furor.

END OF SUMMARY.
