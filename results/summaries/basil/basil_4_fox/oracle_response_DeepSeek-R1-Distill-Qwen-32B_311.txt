Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the specific morally framed words to include. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Republican senators pressuring their chairman, Michael Steele, to apologize for his comments about the Afghanistan war. Steele called it "Obama's war" and suggested it might not be winnable. This caused a backlash, with some conservatives calling for his resignation. Senators DeMint and McCain criticized his remarks, calling them unacceptable and inaccurate. Steele tried to clarify, but the controversy continued, with Kristol still pushing for his resignation.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes the morally framed words: war, fighting, remarks, win, unacceptable, inaccurate, terror, remark. I need to make sure these words are present in the summary.

I should start by identifying the key points: Steele's comments, the backlash, the senators' reactions, Steele's attempt to clarify, and the ongoing controversy. I'll structure the summary to include these elements, using the specified moral terms.

I'll make sure to mention the war, the fighting, the remarks, the need to win, the terms unacceptable and inaccurate, and the reference to terrorism. I'll keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and end it properly as per the user's instructions.

Let me draft the summary now, ensuring all the moral framing words are included and the summary flows logically.

SUMMARY: Republican senators criticized RNC Chairman Michael Steele for his remarks calling Afghanistan a "war of Obama's choosing" and suggesting it may not be winnable. They deemed his comments unacceptable and inaccurate, with Sen. Jim DeMint insisting Steele must apologize to the troops, emphasizing that it is America's war, not Obama's. Sen. John McCain also labeled Steele's remarks wildly inaccurate, urging him to assess his ability to continue in his role. Steele attempted to quell the controversy by issuing a statement reaffirming the need to win the war on terror and support troops, but his efforts failed to quiet the backlash. Prominent conservatives, including Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, continued to call for Steele's resignation, deeming his leadership inadequate amid the ongoing furor. END OF SUMMARY.
