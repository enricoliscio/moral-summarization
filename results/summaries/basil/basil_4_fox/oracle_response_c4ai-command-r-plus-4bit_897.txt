SUMMARY: Republican senators are demanding that party Chairman Michael Steele publicly apologize for his controversial claim that the Afghanistan war is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable. Senator Jim DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina, led the charge, calling Steele's comments "unacceptable" and demanding an apology to the troops, emphasizing that "this is America's war." DeMint and other war-supporting Republicans argue that Steele's remarks are inaccurate and detrimental to the party's unity and focus on the upcoming election. Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, also weighed in, calling Steele's comments "wildly inaccurate." In response, Steele issued a statement reaffirming the country's commitment to winning "the war on terror" and providing necessary support to the troops. However, the backlash continued, with some conservatives, including Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, calling for Steele's resignation. Steele's off-the-cuff remarks have caused a significant rift within the party, and many are now questioning his ability to lead effectively.
END OF SUMMARY.
