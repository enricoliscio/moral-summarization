SUMMARY:

Republican senators and conservative leaders are calling for GOP Chairman Michael Steele to apologize and potentially resign after his controversial comments on Afghanistan. Steele claimed that the war in Afghanistan is "Obama's war" and may not be winnable, sparking outrage among war-supporting Republicans. Senators Jim DeMint and John McCain, among others, condemned Steele's remarks as "unacceptable," "inaccurate," and "wildly inaccurate." DeMint demanded an apology to the troops, emphasizing that Afghanistan is "America's war," not Obama's. McCain suggested Steele assess whether he can still function in his role and make an "appropriate decision" about his future. Despite Steele's attempts to clarify his remarks, the backlash continues, with Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol leading the charge for Steele's resignation.
