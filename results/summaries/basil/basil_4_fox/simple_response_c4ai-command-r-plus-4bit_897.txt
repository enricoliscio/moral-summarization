SUMMARY: Republican senators are demanding that party Chairman Michael Steele apologize for his claim that the Afghanistan war may not be winnable and is "a war of Obama's choosing." Senator Jim DeMint called Steele's comments "unacceptable" and "inaccurate," arguing that Steele must apologize to the troops as the war is "America's war, not Obama's war." Senator John McCain also criticized Steele's remarks as "wildly inaccurate." Steele issued a statement emphasizing the need to win the war on terror and support the troops but stopped short of a public apology. Conservative commentator Bill Kristol called for Steele's resignation, arguing that his comments were inappropriate and reflect poorly on the party. Steele's response failed to quell the controversy, and Kristol reiterated his call for Steele to step down. The incident highlights the moral responsibility of political leaders to support the troops and maintain a unified front in times of war, even if it means putting aside personal beliefs or political differences. It also raises questions about the appropriate balance between personal expression and party discipline in political leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
