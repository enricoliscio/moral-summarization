SUMMARY:

Republican senators are demanding that party Chairman Michael Steele apologize for his "unacceptable" and "inaccurate" remarks that the war in Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable. Sen. Jim DeMint called for Steele to apologize to the troops, stating that Afghanistan is "America's war" and that Steele's comments were "wildly inaccurate." Sen. John McCain also condemned Steele's remarks, saying they were "wildly inaccurate" and that Steele needs to assess whether he can still function in his job. Steele's attempts to quell the controversy with a statement reaffirming the need to "win the war on terror" were unsuccessful. Conservatives, including Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, are calling for Steele's resignation, saying it would be "better if he went." The backlash against Steele's remarks highlights the importance of supporting the troops and winning the war against terror.
