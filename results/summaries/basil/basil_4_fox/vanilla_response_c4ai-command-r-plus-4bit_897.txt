SUMMARY: Republican senators are pressuring party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize for his comments claiming that the Afghanistan war may not be winnable and referring to it as "Obama's choosing." Sen. Jim DeMint and Sen. John McCain have criticized Steele's remarks as inaccurate and unacceptable, with DeMint calling for an apology to the troops. Some conservatives, including Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, have even called for Steele's resignation. Steele has issued a statement attempting to clarify his position and asserting that America must win the war on terror, but the controversy has persisted. Critics argue that Steele needs to refocus on the upcoming election and assess whether he can effectively continue in his role as chairman.
