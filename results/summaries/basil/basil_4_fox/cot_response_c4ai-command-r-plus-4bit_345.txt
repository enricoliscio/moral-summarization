SUMMARY:
Republican senators are pressuring party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize for his claim that the Afghanistan war may not be winnable and is "a war of Obama's choosing." The backlash from his remarks was swift and severe, with some prominent conservatives calling for his resignation. Senators Jim DeMint and John McCain, both war supporters, deemed Steele's comments "unacceptable" and "inaccurate." They asserted that the war in Afghanistan is "America's war," and Steele owes an apology to the troops. Despite Steele's attempts to clarify his statement and quell the controversy, some critics, such as Bill Kristol, still maintain that Steele "needs to go." Steele's history of off-the-cuff remarks is again putting him in hot water, with some questioning his ability to lead the party effectively. This incident highlights the moral dilemma of balancing free speech with the responsibility and accuracy expected of political leaders.
