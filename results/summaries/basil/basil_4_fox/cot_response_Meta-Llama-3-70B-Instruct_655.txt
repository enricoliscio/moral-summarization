SUMMARY:
Republican senators are calling for party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize and clarify his recent comments on Afghanistan, which they deem "unacceptable" and "inaccurate". Steele claimed that the war in Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable, sparking backlash from conservatives. Sen. Jim DeMint and Sen. John McCain, both strong supporters of the war, demanded that Steele apologize to the troops and refocus on the November election. Steele's attempt to quell the controversy with a statement reaffirming America's need to win the war on terror fell short, with critics like Bill Kristol continuing to call for his resignation. The controversy has raised questions about Steele's ability to lead the party, with many calling his comments "wildly inaccurate" and demanding an "appropriate" decision about his future.
