SUMMARY: Republican senators heavily criticized Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele for his comment that the war in Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing." Many senators, including Jim DeMint and John McCain, called for Steele to apologize to the troops and clarify his stance. DeMint emphasized that the war in Afghanistan is America's war and not Obama's, while McCain described Steele's comments as "wildly inaccurate." There were even calls for Steele's resignation, with Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol leading the charge. Steele attempted to quell the controversy by issuing a statement affirming America's commitment to winning the war on terror and providing support for the troops. However, his statement did little to quiet the backlash, and some still called for his resignation. Steele also sent an email to RNC members expressing hope that his statement would clear up any confusion caused by his earlier remarks. END OF SUMMARY.
