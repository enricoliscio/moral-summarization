Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Republican senators pressuring Michael Steele. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article talks about how Republican senators are putting pressure on their chairman, Michael Steele, to explain and apologize for his comments about Afghanistan being Obama's war and possibly unwinnable. The backlash was quick, with some conservatives calling for his resignation.

Jim DeMint, a senator from South Carolina, says Steele needs to apologize to the troops, calling the comments unacceptable and inaccurate. He emphasizes that it's America's war, not Obama's. DeMint also wants Steele to refocus on the election and be a better chairman.

John McCain also weighs in, saying Steele's comments were wildly inaccurate and that Steele should assess his ability to continue in his role. Steele tried to calm things down by issuing a statement reaffirming the need to win the war on terror and supporting the troops, but it didn't stop the criticism.

Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, led the call for Steele's resignation and still thinks he should step down, despite Steele trying to convince him otherwise.

So, the key points are: Steele's controversial comments, the backlash from prominent Republicans, their demands for an apology and possibly resignation, Steele's attempt to clarify, and the ongoing controversy.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the main actors and their positions. I'll structure it by mentioning the senators' pressure, their specific criticisms, Steele's response, and the ongoing calls for his resignation.

Let me make sure I include all the important details without getting too wordy. I'll start by stating the pressure on Steele, then mention DeMint's and McCain's comments, Steele's attempt to clarify, and Kristol's stance. I'll keep it concise and within the word limit.
