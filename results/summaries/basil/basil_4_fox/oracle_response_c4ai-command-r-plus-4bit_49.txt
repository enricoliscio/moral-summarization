SUMMARY: Republican senators are demanding that party Chairman Michael Steele publicly apologize for his controversial claim that the Afghanistan war may not be winnable and is a "war of Obama's choosing." Senator Jim DeMint, a war supporter, called Steele's remarks "unacceptable" and "inaccurate," arguing that Steele must apologize to the troops as the Afghanistan conflict is "America's war." Senator John McCain echoed these sentiments, stating that Steele's comments were "wildly inaccurate." Steele attempted to quell the backlash by issuing a statement affirming America's need to win the war on terror and provide necessary support to troops. However, his response did little to quiet the controversy, with some conservatives, led by Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, calling for his resignation. Steele's off-the-cuff remarks have caused significant friction within the party, leading to questions about his ability to lead effectively.
END OF SUMMARY.
