SUMMARY:

Republican senators are calling for party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize and clarify his recent comments that the war in Afghanistan is "Obama's war" and may not be winnable. Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) criticized Steele's remarks as "unacceptable" and "wildly inaccurate", saying that Afghanistan is a war that the US must win. DeMint demanded an apology to the troops, while McCain suggested Steele assess whether he can still function in his job. Steele attempted to quell the controversy with a statement reaffirming the importance of winning the war on terror, but it did not seem to quiet the backlash. Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, who led the charge against Steele, said the chairman should still step down. The controversy has sparked calls for Steele's resignation.
