SUMMARY:
Republican senators are calling for party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize and explain his recent comments that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable. Sen. Jim DeMint and Sen. John McCain deemed Steele's remarks "unacceptable" and "wildly inaccurate", stating that Afghanistan is a war the United States must win. Steele's comments were seen as a betrayal to the troops, with DeMint demanding an apology to the military. Despite Steele's attempt to clarify his stance, the controversy persists, with Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol leading the charge for Steele's resignation. McCain suggested Steele assess whether he can still function in his job and make an "appropriate" decision about his future. The backlash highlights the importance of a chairman who is "focused" and provides "clear" support for the troops. END OF SUMMARY.
