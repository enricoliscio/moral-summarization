SUMMARY:
Republican senators are demanding an apology from party Chairman Michael Steele for his recent comments claiming that the war in Afghanistan may not be winnable and referring to it as "a war of Obama's choosing." Senator Jim DeMint called Steele's remarks "unacceptable" and "inaccurate," arguing that the war in Afghanistan is "America's war," and that Steele needs to apologize to the troops and refocus on the upcoming election. Senator John McCain also criticized Steele's comments as "wildly inaccurate." In response to the backlash, Steele issued a statement affirming America's need to win the war on terror and support its troops. However, his attempts to clear up any confusion caused by his remarks fell short, as some conservatives, including Bill Kristol, continued to call for his resignation. They view his comments as troublesome and causing unnecessary controversy, creating a furor within the party. Steele's future as chairman remains uncertain as some question whether he can still effectively function in his role.
END OF SUMMARY.
