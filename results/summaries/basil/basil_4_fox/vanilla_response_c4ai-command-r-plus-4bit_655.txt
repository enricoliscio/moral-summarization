SUMMARY: Republican senators pressured party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize for his claim that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing." Sen. Jim DeMint called for Steele to apologize to the troops, saying it is "America's war." Steele is known for off-the-cuff remarks, but his Afghanistan comments were too much for some Republicans who support the war. DeMint said Steele needs to "refocus" on the election and called his comments "unacceptable" and "inaccurate." Sen. John McCain also criticized Steele's comments as "wildly inaccurate." Steele issued a statement saying America must win the war on terror, but it did little to quell the controversy. Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol called for Steele's resignation, saying his comments were unacceptable.
END OF SUMMARY.
