Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. The article is about Republican senators pressuring their chairman, Michael Steele, to apologize for his comments about Afghanistan. 

Steele referred to the war as "Obama's choosing" and suggested it might not be winnable. This caused a backlash, with some conservatives calling for his resignation. Senator Jim DeMint said Steele must apologize to the troops and that the war isn't Obama's but America's. DeMint also criticized Steele's focus on the election. Senator John McCain called Steele's remarks "wildly inaccurate" and questioned his ability to continue in his role.

Steele tried to clarify by stating that America must win the war on terror and support the troops, but this didn't calm the controversy. Bill Kristol, a conservative leader, still wanted Steele to resign, despite Steele's efforts to convince him otherwise.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Steele's comments, the backlash from senators, their demands for an apology, and the ongoing controversy despite Steele's statement. I should mention the main senators involved and the outcome of Steele's attempt to clarify.

Let me structure this: start with the pressure on Steele, mention the specific comments, the senators' reactions, their demands, and the result of Steele's response. Keep it concise and within the word limit.
