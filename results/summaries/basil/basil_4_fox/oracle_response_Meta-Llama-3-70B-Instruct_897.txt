SUMMARY:

Republican senators are demanding an apology from party Chairman Michael Steele for his "unacceptable" and "inaccurate" remarks that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable. Sen. Jim DeMint called Steele's comments a "remark" that disrespects the troops, saying "This is America's war. It's not Obama's war." DeMint believes Steele needs to "refocus" on the November election and apologize to the military for his "wildly inaccurate" statement. Sen. John McCain also condemned Steele's remarks, saying they were "wildly inaccurate" and that Steele must assess whether he can still function in his job. Despite Steele's attempt to clarify his statement, the controversy continues, with conservatives like Bill Kristol calling for his resignation. The debate centers on the importance of winning the "war on terror" and supporting the troops in their "fighting" efforts.
