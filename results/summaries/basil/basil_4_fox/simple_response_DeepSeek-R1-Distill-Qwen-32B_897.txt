Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Republican senators pressuring Michael Steele, the party chairman, to apologize for his comments about Afghanistan. Steele called it "Obama's war" and suggested it might not be winnable. Some conservatives are calling for his resignation.

I need to make sure the summary captures the key points: who is involved, what the issue is, and the reactions. Also, I should highlight the moral aspects, like the criticism over undermining the troops and the need for leadership focus.

I should start by stating the main event: senators pressuring Steele. Then mention the specific comments and the backlash. Include DeMint's and McCain's reactions, emphasizing the inappropriateness and inaccuracy. Steele's attempt to clarify didn't help, and Kristol's call for resignation adds to the pressure.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary details. Make sure to preserve the moral framing, like respect for the troops and the importance of a focused chairman.

Let me structure it: introduce the issue, reactions from senators, Steele's response, and the ongoing pressure. That should cover all bases succinctly.

SUMMARY: Republican senators criticized RNC Chairman Michael Steele for his remarks calling Afghanistan a "war of Obama's choosing" and suggesting it may not be winnable. They demanded a public apology, with Sen. Jim DeMint insisting Steele must apologize to U.S. troops, emphasizing that the war is "America's war." Steele's comments were deemed "unacceptable" and "inaccurate," with some conservatives calling for his resignation. Steele attempted to clarify his stance, stating that "America must win the war on terror" and expressing support for troops, but his efforts did little to quell criticism. Sen. John McCain also criticized Steele's remarks as "wildly inaccurate," while conservative commentator Bill Kristol continued to advocate for Steele's resignation, arguing it would be "better if he went." The controversy highlights divisions within the GOP over leadership and messaging on national security issues. END OF SUMMARY.
