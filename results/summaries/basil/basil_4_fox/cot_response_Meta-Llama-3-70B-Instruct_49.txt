SUMMARY:
Republican senators are demanding an apology from party Chairman Michael Steele for his comments on Afghanistan, which they deem "unacceptable" and "inaccurate". Steele claimed that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable, sparking outrage among conservatives. Senators Jim DeMint and John McCain, strong supporters of the war, called Steele's remarks "wildly inaccurate" and said he needs to "refocus" on the November election. DeMint demanded an apology to the troops, emphasizing that Afghanistan is "America's war", not Obama's. Steele attempted to quell the controversy with a statement, but it failed to calm the storm. Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, who led the charge against Steele, said the chairman still needs to step down, despite his attempts to convince him otherwise. The controversy highlights the need for Steele to make an "appropriate decision" about his future as party chairman.
