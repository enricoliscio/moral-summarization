SUMMARY:
Republican senators are demanding that party Chairman Michael Steele publicly apologize for his claim that the Afghanistan war may not be winnable and is "a war of Obama's choosing." The backlash to Steele's remarks was swift and severe, with some prominent conservatives calling for his resignation. Senators Jim DeMint and John McCain criticized Steele's comments as "inaccurate" and "unacceptable," arguing that the war in Afghanistan is "America's war," not Obama's. They called on Steele to refocus on the upcoming election and to apologize to the troops for his remarks. While Steele issued a statement reiterating the need for America to win the war on terror and support its troops, the controversy surrounding his comments persisted. Some, like Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, continue to call for Steele's resignation, believing that his comments were inappropriate and that he is no longer fit to serve as party chairman.
