Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first. 

So, the article is about Republican senators pressuring their chairman, Michael Steele, to explain and apologize for his comments about Afghanistan. Steele called it "Obama's war" and suggested it might not be winnable. That upset a lot of conservatives, some even called for his resignation. 

Senators like Jim DeMint and John McCain are involved. DeMint said Steele needs to apologize to the troops and that the war isn't Obama's, it's America's. He also criticized Steele for not focusing on the election. McCain said Steele's comments were inaccurate and that he needs to assess his job performance. 

Steele tried to calm things down by issuing a statement about winning the war on terror and supporting the troops, but it didn't stop the criticism. Bill Kristol from The Weekly Standard wants Steele to resign, even though Steele tried to talk him out of it.

I need to capture all these points concisely, keeping the moral framing intact. The key points are Steele's comments, the backlash from senators and conservatives, his attempt to apologize, and the ongoing criticism leading to calls for resignation. I should make sure to highlight the main actors and their positions clearly.
