SUMMARY: Republican senators demanded that party Chairman Michael Steele apologize for his claim that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., called Steele's comments "unacceptable" and "inaccurate," saying that Steele needed to apologize to the troops and that the war in Afghanistan is "America's war." Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also criticized Steele's remarks as "wildly inaccurate." Prominent conservatives, including Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, called for Steele's resignation, arguing that he is not fit to lead the party. Steele issued a statement attempting to clarify his earlier remarks and expressing support for the troops and the war on terror, but the backlash continued. Critics argue that Steele's comments are detrimental to the party and that he has failed to effectively fulfill his role as party chairman. This incident highlights the ethical dilemma between personal expression and political responsibility, as well as the moral obligation to support the troops and respect their sacrifices. It also raises questions about the appropriate consequences for controversial statements made by public figures.
