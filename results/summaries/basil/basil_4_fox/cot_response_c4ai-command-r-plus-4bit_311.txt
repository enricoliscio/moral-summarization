SUMMARY:
Republican senators are demanding an apology from party Chairman Michael Steele for his claim that the war in Afghanistan may not be winnable and is a "war of Obama's choosing." The backlash from Steele's remarks was swift and severe, with some prominent conservatives calling for his resignation. Senators Jim DeMint and John McCain both criticized Steele's comments as "unacceptable" and "inaccurate," with DeMint saying that Steele needed to "apologize to our military" and McCain stating that Steele must assess whether he can still effectively serve in his role. While Steele issued a statement attempting to quell the furor and clarify his position, the controversy persisted, with some still calling for his resignation. The incident highlights the moral framing of words like "pressure," "backlash," "unacceptable," and "inaccurate," underscoring the ethical dimensions of political discourse and the weight of responsibility carried by those in leadership positions.
