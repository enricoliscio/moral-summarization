SUMMARY:

Republican senators are demanding that party Chairman Michael Steele apologize for his "unacceptable" and "inaccurate" remarks that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable. Sen. Jim DeMint called for Steele to "refocus" on the November election and apologize to the troops, saying "This is America's war. It's not Obama's war." Sen. John McCain deemed Steele's comments "wildly inaccurate" and suggested he assess whether he can still function in his job. Despite Steele's attempt to clarify his stance, saying "America must win the war on terror," the controversy persists. Conservatives, including Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, are calling for Steele's resignation, saying his remarks were a "remark" that cannot be taken back. The backlash highlights the gravity of Steele's words, which have been deemed "unacceptable" and "inaccurate" by many in the GOP.
