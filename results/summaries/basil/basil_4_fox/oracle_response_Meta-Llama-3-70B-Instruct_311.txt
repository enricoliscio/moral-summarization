SUMMARY:

Republican senators are demanding an apology from party Chairman Michael Steele for his "unacceptable" and "inaccurate" remarks that the war in Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable. Sen. Jim DeMint called for Steele to apologize to the troops, stating that Afghanistan is "America's war" and not Obama's. DeMint and Sen. John McCain deemed Steele's comments "wildly inaccurate" and said he needs to "refocus" on the November election. Steele's attempt to quell the controversy with a statement reaffirming the importance of winning the "war on terror" fell flat. Conservatives, including Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, are calling for Steele's resignation, saying it would be "better if he went". The backlash against Steele's remarks highlights the gravity of the situation in Afghanistan and the need for strong leadership to support the troops fighting in this critical war.
