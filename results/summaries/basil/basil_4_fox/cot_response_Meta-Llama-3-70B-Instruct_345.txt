SUMMARY:
Republican senators are calling for party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize for his "unacceptable" and "inaccurate" comments that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable. Sen. Jim DeMint demanded an apology to the troops, stating that Afghanistan is "America's war" and not Obama's. DeMint and Sen. John McCain deemed Steele's remarks "wildly inaccurate" and urged him to "refocus" on the November election. Steele's attempt to clarify his statement did little to quell the controversy, with Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol leading the charge for Steele's resignation. Kristol believes it would be "better" if Steele stepped down. The backlash highlights the importance of a chairman who is "focused" and supportive of the troops. Steele's future as chairman remains uncertain.

END OF SUMMARY.
