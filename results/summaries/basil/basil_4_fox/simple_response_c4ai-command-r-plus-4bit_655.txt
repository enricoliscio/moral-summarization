SUMMARY: Republican senators are calling for party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize and provide further explanation for his comment that Afghanistan is "a war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable. Senator Jim DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina, led the charge, stating that Steele's comments were "unacceptable" and "inaccurate," and that Steele should apologize to the troops as the war in Afghanistan is "America's war." DeMint emphasized the need for a focused chairman leading up to the November election. Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, echoed these sentiments, calling Steele's comments "wildly inaccurate." In an attempt to calm the situation, Steele issued a statement affirming the need for America to win the war on terror and support its troops. However, his statement did little to quell the controversy, with some conservatives, led by Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, continuing to call for Steele's resignation. Steele's off-the-cuff remark has caused significant backlash within the Republican Party, with many questioning his ability to effectively lead the party. END OF SUMMARY.
