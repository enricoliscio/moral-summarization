SUMMARY:
Republican senators are calling for party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize and explain his recent comments that the war in Afghanistan is "Obama's war" and may not be winnable. Sen. Jim DeMint and Sen. John McCain deemed Steele's remarks "unacceptable" and "wildly inaccurate", stating that Afghanistan is "America's war" and not Obama's. DeMint demanded an apology to the troops, while McCain suggested Steele assess whether he can still function in his job. Despite Steele's attempt to clarify his statement, the backlash continued, with Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol leading the charge of conservatives calling for Steele's resignation. The controversy surrounding Steele's comments has sparked a debate about his ability to lead the party, with many calling for him to step down and refocus on the November election. END OF SUMMARY.
