SUMMARY:

Republican senators and conservative leaders are calling for Party Chairman Michael Steele to apologize and potentially resign after his remarks on Afghanistan being a "war of Obama's choosing" and possibly unwinnable. Senators Jim DeMint and John McCain condemned Steele's comments as "unacceptable" and "wildly inaccurate," saying they undermine the troops and the war effort. DeMint demanded an apology to the military, emphasizing that Afghanistan is "America's war," not Obama's. McCain suggested Steele assess whether he can still function in his role. Despite Steele's attempt to clarify his remarks, the backlash continued, with Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol leading the charge for Steele's resignation. The moral framing of this story highlights the importance of accountability, respect for the military, and responsible leadership. Steele's comments are seen as a betrayal of these values, and his refusal to fully apologize and take responsibility has sparked outrage.
