SUMMARY: Republican senators have demanded that party Chairman Michael Steele apologize for his recent comments claiming that the Afghanistan war may not be winnable and referring to it as "a war of Obama's choosing." Steele's remarks sparked backlash from prominent conservatives, including Senator Jim DeMint and Senator John McCain, who criticized Steele for his "unacceptable" and "inaccurate" statements. DeMint emphasized that the Afghanistan war is America's war and called for Steele to refocus on the upcoming election. McCain described Steele's comments as "wildly inaccurate" and suggested that Steele assess his ability to continue in his role. Despite Steele's attempts to clarify his statement and emphasize the need to win the war on terror, the controversy persisted, with some conservatives calling for his resignation. Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, led the charge, stating that Steele's remarks were unacceptable and that he should step down. The incident highlights the importance of responsible discourse in political leadership, especially when discussing matters of national security and the sacrifices made by troops in the fight against terror.
