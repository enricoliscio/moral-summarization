Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. The article is about Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, apologizing for grabbing a young man during an encounter. 

First, I should identify the key elements: who, what, when, where, why, and how. The who is Bob Etheridge, a seven-term congressman. The what is him grabbing a young man while a video was being recorded. The when is Monday, and the where is on a sidewalk. The why seems to be because the young man was asking him about supporting Obama's agenda. 

The article mentions that Etheridge issued a public apology, regretting his reaction and emphasizing his commitment to respectful discourse. There's also context about the video being posted by a conservative website and the political implications, including his re-election challenges and the reaction from Republicans.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Etheridge's apology, the incident details, his response, and the political fallout. I should make sure to include his statement about respect and civil discourse, the fact that the young man wasn't identified, and the spread of the video by Breitbart and the NRCC. Also, mention the Republican reaction and Etheridge's political standing.

I should keep the summary concise, focusing on the main points without getting bogged down in too much detail. Making sure to include all necessary elements without exceeding the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each sentence adds value and flows logically.
