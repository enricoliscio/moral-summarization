SUMMARY: North Carolina Representative Bob Etheridge physically assaults a young man who asks about his support for Obama's agenda, prompting moral outrage and an apology from the congressman. The congressman's aggressive reaction to a simple question highlights a disturbing trend of partisan politics overshadowing civil discourse. The incident, which was caught on camera and widely circulated, demonstrates a concerning lack of respect and civility in political discourse. Etheridge's apology acknowledges the importance of treating people with respect regardless of political differences, but his actions raise questions about the state of moral decency in politics today. The incident also draws attention to the increasingly common practice of secretly recording public figures, raising ethical questions about privacy and consent. The video was posted by a conservative publisher, and a Republican spokesman criticized Etheridge's conduct, using the incident to score political points. The congressman's re-election race is also mentioned, providing context for the political motivations behind the incident's publicity. This story serves as a cautionary tale, reminding us of the importance of maintaining civility and respect in political discourse, regardless of partisan differences.
END OF SUMMARY.
