SUMMARY:
Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, issued an apology for his regretful reaction to a young man's question about supporting President Obama's agenda. In a video, Etheridge can be seen grabbing the man by the hand, arm, and neck, and repeatedly asking him to identify himself. Etheridge deeply regrets his poor response and apologizes to all involved, stating that he has always tried to treat people with respect, regardless of their viewpoints. He emphasized the importance of promoting a civil public discourse. The video, which was posted on a conservative Web site, has received widespread attention and has been circulated by the National Republican Congressional Committee, with a Republican spokesman calling Etheridge's conduct "unbecoming of a member of Congress" and saying he has "lost it."
