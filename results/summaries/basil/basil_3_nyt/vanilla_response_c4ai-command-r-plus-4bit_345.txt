SUMMARY: A video surfaced on Monday showing Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck after being asked whether he supports President Obama's agenda. The congressman has issued an apology for his reaction, acknowledging that his response was inappropriate and pledging to promote civil public discourse. The video, which was posted on a conservative website and circulated by the National Republican Congressional Committee, has drawn criticism from Republicans, who have called the congressman's behavior "unbecoming of a member of Congress." Etheridge, who represents a conservative district, is facing a reelection challenge but is not considered a top Republican target. The incident highlights the increasingly partisan and intrusive nature of modern politics, with some arguing that it does not justify the congressman's poor response. In other news, Vice President Joseph Biden has resumed the White House campaign for gun control, advocating for executive action and congressional legislation. END OF SUMMARY.
