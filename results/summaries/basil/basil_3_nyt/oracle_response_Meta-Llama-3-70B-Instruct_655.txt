SUMMARY:

Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, issued an apology for his unacceptable behavior towards a young man who asked if he supported President Obama's agenda. The video shows Etheridge grabbing the man by the hand, arm, and neck, repeatedly asking him to identify himself, and attempting to take control of the camera. Etheridge's actions were a clear display of disrespect and a poor response to a legitimate question. In his apology, Etheridge acknowledged that his conduct was unbecoming of a member of Congress and that he has always tried to promote a civil public discourse. He expressed deep regret for his reaction and promised to continue promoting respect for all viewpoints. The incident has sparked widespread attention and criticism, with Republicans calling out Etheridge's behavior as unacceptable.

END OF SUMMARY.
