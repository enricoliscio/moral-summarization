Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Representative Bob Etheridge apologizing for grabbing a young man. I need to capture the key points: who, what, when, where, why.

First, the main event is Etheridge grabbing the man while a video was being recorded. The man was asking about Obama's agenda. I should note that Etheridge apologized and mentioned his commitment to civil discourse. Also, the video was posted by a conservative site and is part of a re-election challenge, though it's not a top target.

I should keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it's concise. I'll start with Etheridge's apology, describe the incident briefly, mention the video's source and political implications, and end with the re-election context. Need to make sure all important details are included without getting too wordy.

SUMMARY: Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, apologized for grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck while the man attempted to ask him about his support for President Obama’s agenda. The incident was captured on video and widely shared after being posted by conservative web publisher Andrew Breitbart. Etheridge expressed regret for his actions, stating he has always strived to treat people with respect and promote civil discourse. The young man, dressed in a jacket and tie, approached Etheridge on a sidewalk and asked if he fully supported Obama’s agenda. Etheridge repeatedly asked the man to identify himself before grabbing him. A second person accompanying the young man filmed the encounter. The video sparked criticism, with Republican spokesman Jon Thompson calling Etheridge’s behavior unbecoming of a member of Congress. Etheridge, who faces a re-election challenge, won his district by a large margin two years ago, though it is not a top Republican target. END OF SUMMARY.
