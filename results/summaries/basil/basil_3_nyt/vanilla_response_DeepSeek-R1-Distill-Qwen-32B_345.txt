Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Representative Bob Etheridge apologizing for grabbing a young man. I need to capture the main points: who, what, when, where, why, and how.

First, I should identify the key events. Etheridge grabbed the man while a camera was rolling, and the man was asking about supporting Obama's agenda. The video went viral, and there's some political context, like the congressman facing re-election.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I should include the apology, the incident details, the video's impact, and the political implications. Also, mention the reaction from the Republican side and Etheridge's district background.

I'll structure it by starting with the apology, then the incident, the video's spread, the reactions, and conclude with the political context. Keep it clear and straightforward without too much jargon.

Let me check the word count as I draft. Make sure each sentence is tight and adds necessary info without fluff. Avoid any unnecessary details that don't contribute to the summary.

Alright, I think I have a good structure. Let me put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY:  
Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, apologized for grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck during an encounter where the man asked him about his support for President Obama’s agenda. Etheridge stated he regretted his actions and emphasized his commitment to respectful public discourse. The incident, captured on video, showed Etheridge repeatedly asking the man to identify himself before grabbing him and the camera. The video, posted by conservative publisher Andrew Breitbart, sparked widespread attention and criticism. Republican Jon Thompson called Etheridge’s behavior unbecoming of a congressman. Etheridge, representing a conservative district, faces re-election challenges but is not a top Republican target. His district narrowly supported Obama in 2012. Meanwhile, Vice President Biden resumed advocating for gun control legislation.  
END OF SUMMARY.
