SUMMARY:
Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, has issued an apology for his "poor response" to a young man who asked if he supports President Obama's agenda. In a video, Etheridge can be seen grabbing the man by the hand, arm, and neck, repeatedly asking him to identify himself. Etheridge said he "deeply and profoundly regrets" his reaction, adding that he has always tried to treat people with "respect" and promote a "civil public discourse". The video, posted on a conservative website, has sparked widespread attention, with Republicans calling his conduct "unbecoming" of a member of Congress. Etheridge faces a re-election challenge in a conservative district. END OF SUMMARY.
