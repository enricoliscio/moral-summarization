Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Representative Bob Etheridge. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article says that Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, apologized for grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck while a video camera was recording. The man was trying to ask Etheridge if he supported Obama's agenda. Etheridge regretted his reaction and apologized, emphasizing that he's always tried to respect people with different viewpoints, even in partisan politics. He also mentioned promoting civil discourse.

The young man approached Etheridge on the sidewalk, asked about supporting Obama's agenda, and Etheridge asked for his identification. Then he grabbed the camera and the man. The video was posted by Andrew Breitbart and circulated by the National Republican Congressional Committee. A Republican spokesman criticized Etheridge, saying his conduct was unbecoming. Etheridge is in a conservative district and faces re-election, though it's not a top target. He won by a large margin before, and Obama barely won his district.

There's also a mention of Biden resuming the gun control campaign, but that seems less related to the main story about Etheridge.

So, the key points are: Etheridge's apology, the incident where he grabbed the man, the video's circulation, the criticism, his political standing, and the context of the district.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should make sure to include all the important details without getting too bogged down in specifics. Maybe mention the apology, the incident, the video's spread, the criticism, his district's political lean, and his re-election status.

I should avoid including the Biden part since it's a separate topic. Focus on Etheridge's actions, the response, and the political implications.

Let me structure it: start with the apology, describe the incident briefly, mention the video and its spread, the criticism, his political situation, and his district's background.

Make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.
