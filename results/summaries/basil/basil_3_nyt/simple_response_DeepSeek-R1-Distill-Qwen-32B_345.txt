Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

Representative Bob Etheridge from North Carolina apologized for grabbing a young man who tried to ask him about supporting Obama's agenda. The video shows him confronting the man, asking for his identity, and grabbing him. Etheridge regretted his action and emphasized his commitment to respectful discourse. The incident was widely shared by Breitbart and the Republican committee, criticizing Etheridge's conduct. He's facing re-election but isn't a top target. Biden is also mentioned resuming the gun control campaign.

Now, I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects. The article highlights the Congressman's lapse in decorum and the subsequent criticism. I should include his apology, the context of the incident, the reaction from Republicans, and the political implications. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally. I'll start by stating the apology, describe the incident briefly, mention the video's spread, the criticism, and end with the political context and Biden's action. That should cover all the necessary points while maintaining the moral framing.
