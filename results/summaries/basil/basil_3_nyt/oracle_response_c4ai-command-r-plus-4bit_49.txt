SUMMARY: Representative Bob Etheridge has apologized for his disrespectful conduct after a video surfaced showing him grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck as he tried to ask the congressman about his support for President Obama's agenda. The video, which was posted online and circulated by Republicans, has sparked criticism for Etheridge's poor actions and response. In his apology, Etheridge acknowledged that his reaction was inappropriate and that he should have always promoted civil public discourse no matter the intrusiveness and partisanship of politics. The incident has brought attention to the congressman's re-election challenge in a conservative district, although it is not among the top Republican targets. Vice President Biden has also resumed the push for gun control, advocating for both executive action and legislative action from Congress.
END OF SUMMARY.
