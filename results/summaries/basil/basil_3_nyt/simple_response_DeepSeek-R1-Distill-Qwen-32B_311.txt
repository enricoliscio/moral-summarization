Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article they provided. They mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, preserving the moral framing the author gave. So, I should focus on the key points and the ethical aspects of the story.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main events. Representative Bob Etheridge grabbed a young man while a camera was rolling. The young man was asking about support for Obama's agenda. Etheridge apologized, emphasizing respect and civil discourse. The video went viral, and Republicans criticized him. He's facing re-election but isn't a top target. Biden is working on gun control.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight the incident, the apology, the moral aspect, and the political implications. I'll make sure to include the key details without getting too bogged down in specifics.

I'll start by stating the incident, then move to Etheridge's apology and his commitment to civil discourse. Mention the young man's attire and the video's spread. Include the Republican reaction and Etheridge's political standing. Finally, note Biden's efforts on gun control as context.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, maintaining the moral framing by emphasizing respect and decorum in public service. Keep it concise and clear, avoiding unnecessary details. That should meet the user's requirements effectively.

SUMMARY: Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, apologized for grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck while the man attempted to ask him about his support for President Obama’s agenda. Etheridge expressed regret for his reaction, stating he has always aimed to treat people with respect and promote civil discourse, despite the intrusiveness of politics. The incident, captured on video, showed Etheridge repeatedly asking the young man to identify himself before physically grabbing him. The video, posted by conservative publisher Andrew Breitbart, sparked widespread attention and criticism, with Republican Jon Thompson calling Etheridge’s behavior unbecoming of a member of Congress. Etheridge, representing a conservative district, faces re-election challenges but is not a top Republican target. Meanwhile, Vice President Biden resumed efforts to push gun control legislation in Washington. END OF SUMMARY.
