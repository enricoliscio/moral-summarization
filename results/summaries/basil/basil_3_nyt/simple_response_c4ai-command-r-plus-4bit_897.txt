SUMMARY: In a shocking display of aggression, Representative Bob Etheridge, Democrat of North Carolina, was caught on camera grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck when he was asked whether he supports President Obama's agenda. The congressman's aggressive reaction and attempt to silence the young man are a stark contrast to his apology, where he acknowledges the importance of civil public discourse and treating people with respect. The incident raises concerns about the increasingly intrusive and partisan nature of politics and the potential for elected officials to abuse their power. The video has received widespread attention and condemnation, with a Republican spokesman stating that Mr. Etheridge's conduct is "unbecoming of a member of Congress." This event highlights the importance of maintaining respectful and civil discourse, even in the face of political differences. It serves as a reminder that elected officials should be held to a high standard of behavior and accountability to the public they serve.
END OF SUMMARY.
