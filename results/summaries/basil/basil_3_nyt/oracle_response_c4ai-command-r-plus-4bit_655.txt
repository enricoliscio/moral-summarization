SUMMARY: Representative Bob Etheridge, Democrat of North Carolina, issued an apology for his actions after a video surfaced showing him grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck as the man tried to ask him about his support for President Obama's agenda. In his apology, Mr. Etheridge acknowledged that he should have treated the young man with respect and promoted civil public discourse, regardless of the intrusive and partisan nature of modern politics. The video, which received widespread attention, showed the congressman grabbing the camera and the young man, repeatedly demanding that he identify himself. The incident has raised questions about Mr. Etheridge's conduct, with Republicans criticizing his response as "unbecoming of a member of Congress." The incident also highlights the increasingly polarized nature of American politics, where even a simple question about political affiliation can lead to a heated confrontation. Mr. Etheridge's apology recognizes the importance of respect and civil discourse in a democratic society, regardless of political views.
END OF SUMMARY.
