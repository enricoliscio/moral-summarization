SUMMARY: A Democrat congressman, Bob Etheridge, has apologized for his aggressive behavior towards a young man who tried to ask him about his support for President Obama's agenda. The incident, which was caught on camera, shows Mr. Etheridge grabbing the young man by the hand, arm, and neck, and demanding to know his identity. The congressman's reaction has been criticized as inappropriate and unbecoming of a member of Congress. The video has received widespread attention and has been used by Republicans to attack Mr. Etheridge, who is facing a re-election challenge in a conservative district. This incident highlights the increasingly partisan and intrusive nature of politics, and Mr. Etheridge's apology acknowledges that his response was not in line with his values of promoting civil public discourse. It also raises questions about the ethics and morality of political discourse and the role of elected officials in fostering a respectful and transparent dialogue with constituents.
END OF SUMMARY.
