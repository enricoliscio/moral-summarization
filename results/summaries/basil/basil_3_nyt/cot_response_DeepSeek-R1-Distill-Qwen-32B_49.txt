Okay, so the user has provided a news article and wants me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to first identify all the morally framed words. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral judgment, like "apology," "regret," "respect," etc. They convey approval or disapproval, so I should look for such terms in the article.

Looking at the article, Representative Bob Etheridge apologizes for grabbing a young man. So "apology" and "regret" are definitely morally framed. The article mentions that Etheridge tried to treat people with respect, so "respect" is another one. The actions are described as "poor response" and "unbecoming," which are negative moral judgments. "Civil public discourse" is a positive framing, promoting good behavior. "Conduct" here is being criticized, so it's framed negatively. "Lost it" implies he's losing control, which is a negative assessment. "Challenge" in the context of re-election could be seen as a test of his character. "Targets" in the political sense, but not sure if it's moral. "Carried" the district by a small margin, but that's more factual. "Campaign" for gun control is more about action than morality. 

Wait, I should make sure I'm not missing any. Let me go through the article again. 

"Apologized," "regret," "respect," "poor response," "civil public discourse," "unbecoming," "lost it," "challenge," "targets," "carried," "campaign." 

Hmm, "challenge" might not be moral, it's more about difficulty. "Targets" is about strategy. "Carried" is just a result. "Campaign" is an action. So the main morally framed words are the first ones I listed.

Now, for the summary. I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise. I'll start by stating Etheridge's apology, mention the grabbing incident, his regret, the attempt to treat people with respect, the poor response, promoting civil discourse, the young man's approach, the video's attention, Breitbart's role, the Republican criticism, his re-election challenge, and Biden's gun control campaign.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points with the moral words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each moral term is included without making it too lengthy.

**SUMMARY:**  
Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, issued an apology for grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck while the man tried to ask him about his support for President Obama’s agenda. Etheridge expressed deep regret for his reaction, emphasizing his commitment to treating people with respect and promoting civil public discourse. The incident, captured on video, showed Etheridge repeatedly asking the young man to identify himself before grabbing him and the camera. The video, which gained widespread attention after being posted by conservative publisher Andrew Breitbart, sparked criticism, with Republicans labeling Etheridge’s conduct as unbecoming. Etheridge, who faces a re-election challenge in a conservative district, won his last race by a significant margin, though his district narrowly supported Obama. Meanwhile, Vice President Biden resumed the administration’s gun control campaign, urging Congress to act.
