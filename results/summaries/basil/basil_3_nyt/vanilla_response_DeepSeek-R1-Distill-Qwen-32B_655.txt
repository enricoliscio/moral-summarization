Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The main points are about Rep. Bob Etheridge apologizing after grabbing a young man in a video. The man was asking him about supporting Obama's agenda. Etheridge says he regrets his action and emphasizes respect in public discourse. The video was posted by Andrew Breitbart and circulated by Republicans. Jon Thompson from the Republicans criticized Etheridge. Etheridge is in a conservative district and faces re-election, but it's not a top target. Biden is pushing gun control again. 

I should make sure the summary includes all these key points concisely, under 200 words. I'll structure it by mentioning the apology, the incident, the reaction from Republicans, his political standing, and Biden's action. I need to keep it clear and to the point without unnecessary details.
