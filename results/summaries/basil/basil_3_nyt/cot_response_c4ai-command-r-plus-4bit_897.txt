SUMMARY:
Congressman Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, issued an apology for his aggressive reaction towards a young man who tried to question him about his support for President Obama's agenda. The incident, which was caught on camera, showed the congressman grabbing the young man by the hand, arm, and neck, demanding to know his identity. The video sparked controversy and was widely circulated, with Republicans criticizing Etheridge's conduct as "unbecoming of a member of Congress." Etheridge, who has served for seven terms and promotes civil public discourse, acknowledged his inappropriate response, expressing regret and apologizing for his actions. He acknowledged that his reaction was unjustified, despite the intrusive and partisan nature of modern politics. The incident underscores the increasing polarization and tension in American politics, where even a simple question about political affiliation can lead to an explosive reaction. END OF SUMMARY.
