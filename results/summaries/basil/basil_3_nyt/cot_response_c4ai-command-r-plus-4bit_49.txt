SUMMARY:
A video surfaced of Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck when the young man tried to ask him if he supports President Obama's agenda. The congressman has issued an *apology*, saying he *regrets* his reaction and that he strives to treat people with *respect*, regardless of their political views. Mr. Etheridge acknowledged that politics can be *intrusive* and *partisan*, but that does not justify a *poor* response. He has promised to continue promoting *civil* discourse. The video, which was made last week, received widespread attention and was circulated by the National Republican Congressional Committee, with a spokesman calling Mr. Etheridge's conduct *unbecoming* of a member of Congress. The congressman is facing a re-election challenge in a conservative district, but his race is not among the top Republican targets. Vice President Biden has also resumed the push for gun control, advocating for both executive action and legislative action from Congress. END OF SUMMARY.
