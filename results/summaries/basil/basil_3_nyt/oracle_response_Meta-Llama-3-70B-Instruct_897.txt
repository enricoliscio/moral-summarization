SUMMARY:

Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, apologized for his unbecoming conduct after a video showed him grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck when asked if he supports President Obama's agenda. Etheridge deeply regretted his reaction, stating that he has always tried to treat people with respect, regardless of their viewpoints. He emphasized the importance of promoting a civil public discourse, even in the face of intrusive and partisan politics. The video, which was widely circulated, showed Etheridge repeatedly asking the young man to identify himself before grabbing him. The incident sparked criticism, with a Republican spokesman calling Etheridge's conduct "unbecoming of a member of Congress." Etheridge, who faces a re-election challenge, has a history of promoting respect and civility in politics.
