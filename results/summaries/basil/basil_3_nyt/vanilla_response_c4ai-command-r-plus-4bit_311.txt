SUMMARY: A video surfaced on Monday showing Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck as he tried to ask the congressman whether he supports President Obama's agenda. The video sparked widespread attention and criticism, with the National Republican Congressional Committee stating that "Bob Etheridge has lost it." Mr. Etheridge issued an apology for his actions, acknowledging that his response was inappropriate and that he strives to promote civil public discourse. In the video, the congressman is seen asking the young man to identify himself repeatedly before grabbing his camera. The incident took place in a conservative district south of Raleigh, where Mr. Etheridge is facing a reelection challenge. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. also resumed the White House campaign for gun control, pushing for Congress to take up legislation again.
