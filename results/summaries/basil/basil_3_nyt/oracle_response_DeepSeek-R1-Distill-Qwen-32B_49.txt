Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the author used specific morally charged words: grabbing, respect, promote, actions, conduct. I should make sure to include these in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Rep. Bob Etheridge grabbed a young man, which was caught on video. He apologized, saying he regrets his reaction and apologized to everyone involved. He mentioned always trying to treat people with respect and promote civil discourse. The young man was trying to ask him about supporting Obama's agenda. The video was widely shared by Breitbart and the NRCC. Republicans criticized his conduct, saying it's unbecoming for a Congressman. Etheridge is in a conservative district but isn't a top target for Republicans. Biden is pushing gun control again.

Now, I need to structure the summary. Start with Etheridge apologizing for grabbing the man, using "grabbing" as a moral term. Mention his regret and the apology. Include his commitment to respect and promote civil discourse. Describe the incident briefly, noting the young man's question and the cameras. Highlight the video's spread and the Republican response, using "conduct." End with the political context and Biden's action.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all the key moral words are included. Also, the summary needs to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me draft it:

Rep. Bob Etheridge apologized for grabbing a young man who asked about his support for Obama's agenda, emphasizing regret and a commitment to respect and civil discourse. The video showed Etheridge insisting on the man's identity, leading to criticism of his conduct. The incident, widely shared, sparked Republican condemnation. Etheridge, in a conservative district, faces re-election challenges, though not a top target. Biden resumed gun control advocacy.

Wait, that's a bit short. Let me add more details without exceeding 200 words.

Rep. Bob Etheridge apologized for grabbing a young man who approached him to ask about his support for Obama's agenda. He regretted his reaction, emphasizing a commitment to respect and promote civil discourse. The video showed Etheridge insisting on the man's identity, leading to widespread attention and criticism of his conduct. Republicans condemned his actions, with Jon Thompson calling it unbecoming. Etheridge, representing a conservative district, faces a re-election challenge but isn't a top Republican target. Biden resumed gun control advocacy.

That should cover all points and include the moral terms. Let me check the word count. It's about 120 words, so I can add a bit more if needed, but it's concise enough.
