SUMMARY:
Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, issued an apology for his aggressive behavior towards a young man who asked if he supports President Obama's agenda. In a video, Etheridge can be seen grabbing the man by the hand, arm, and neck, repeatedly asking him to identify himself. Etheridge expressed "deep and profound regret" for his "poor response" and emphasized his commitment to promoting a "civil public discourse." The incident has sparked widespread attention, with Republicans condemning Etheridge's conduct as "unbecoming of a member of Congress." Etheridge, who faces a re-election challenge, has a history of treating people with "respect" and has always tried to maintain a civil tone in politics. END OF SUMMARY.
