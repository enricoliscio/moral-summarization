SUMMARY:

Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, apologized for his unacceptable conduct towards a young man who asked if he supported President Obama's agenda. In a video, Etheridge can be seen grabbing the man by the hand, arm, and neck, and repeatedly asking him to identify himself. The congressman's actions were widely circulated on the web and sparked criticism, with a Republican spokesman calling his behavior "unbecoming of a member of Congress." Etheridge expressed regret for his reaction, stating that he has always tried to treat people with respect, regardless of their viewpoints. He emphasized his commitment to promoting a civil public discourse, acknowledging that even in the face of intrusive and partisan politics, a poor response is not justified. The incident has raised concerns about Etheridge's fitness for office, particularly as he faces a re-election challenge.
