Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Representative Bob Etheridge apologizing for grabbing a young man. The key points are the incident, his apology, the context of the interaction, and the political implications.

I should highlight that Etheridge apologized, emphasizing his regret and commitment to respectful dialogue. It's important to note that he's a long-serving Democrat in a conservative district, which adds context about his position.

The young man approached him to ask about supporting Obama's agenda. The video shows Etheridge reacting aggressively, which led to criticism. Breitbart and Republicans criticized him, so I should mention that to show the political response.

Also, his re-election isn't a top target, but the incident could affect his campaign. I'll include that detail to show the potential impact.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral elements, like his regret and the criticism about conduct unbecoming a Congressman.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to first state the apology, describe the incident, mention the political context and criticism, and conclude with the potential impact on his re-election.
