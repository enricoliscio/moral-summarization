SUMMARY: Representative Bob Etheridge has apologized for his disrespectful conduct after a video surfaced showing him grabbing a young man by the hand, arm and neck as he tried to ask the congressman whether he supports President Obama's agenda. The video, which was posted online and circulated by a Republican spokesman, shows Mr. Etheridge aggressively demanding that the young man identify himself. The congressman's actions have been criticized as "unbecoming of a member of Congress" and a "poor response" by the National Republican Congressional Committee. In his apology, Mr. Etheridge acknowledged that his reaction was inappropriate and that he should always promote civil public discourse, no matter the intrusiveness or partisanship of the situation. The incident has brought attention to Mr. Etheridge's re-election campaign, although his race is not considered a top target for Republicans. This event highlights the importance of maintaining respectful conduct and taking responsibility for one's actions, even in the highly partisan world of politics.
END OF SUMMARY.
