Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and highlighted specific morally framed words: grabbing, respect, promote, actions, conduct. My task is to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Representative Bob Etheridge grabbed a young man, leading to an apology. The young man was asking about support for Obama's agenda. The video was released by a conservative site and went viral, leading to criticism. Etheridge apologized, emphasizing respect and promoting civil discourse. His district is conservative, and he's up for re-election, but not a top target. Biden is also mentioned resuming gun control efforts.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary under 200 words. I should include the key events: the grabbing incident, the apology, the context of the question, the video's spread, the criticism, and the political implications. I must use the specified moral words: grabbing, respect, promote, actions, conduct.

I'll start by mentioning Etheridge grabbing the man, then his apology, focusing on respect and promoting civil discourse. Next, describe the young man's question and the video's impact. Include the Republican criticism about his conduct. Finally, note his district's political leaning and Biden's unrelated action.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, keeping it within the word limit. I'll check that all moral terms are included and that the summary captures the essence without extra details.

SUMMARY: Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, apologized for grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck while the man attempted to ask him about his support for President Obama’s agenda. Etheridge expressed regret, stating, “I deeply and profoundly regret my reaction and I apologize to all involved,” and emphasized his commitment to treating people with respect and promoting civil public discourse. The incident, captured on video, showed Etheridge repeatedly demanding the young man’s identity before grabbing him. The video, released by conservative publisher Andrew Breitbart, sparked widespread attention and criticism, with Republican spokesman Jon Thompson calling Etheridge’s conduct “unbecoming of a member of Congress.” Etheridge, who represents a conservative district, faces re-election challenges but is not a top Republican target. His district narrowly supported Obama in the last election. Meanwhile, Vice President Biden resumed the administration’s gun control campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
