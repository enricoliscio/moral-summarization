Okay, so I need to help the user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided a news article about Representative Bob Etheridge apologizing for grabbing a young man. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article and then write a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article carefully to spot any morally charged words. Words that indicate judgment or evaluation are key here. For example, "apology," "grabbing," "intrusive," "poor response," "respect," "civil," "unbecoming," "lost it," and "campaign." These words carry moral weight because they relate to behavior, responsibility, and the appropriateness of actions.

Next, I need to create a summary that includes these words. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the essence of the article. I'll start by mentioning Etheridge's apology, then describe the incident, include his regret and commitment to civil discourse. I'll note the conservative district he represents and the political implications. Also, I'll include the reaction from the Republican spokesman and the mention of Vice President Biden's gun control efforts.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without being too detailed. It's important to highlight the moral aspects, like his regret and the criticism he received, to maintain the original framing.

Let me structure the summary step by step. Begin with the apology, describe the incident, mention his regret, the context of his district, the political attention, the criticism from the Republican, and end with the broader implications, including Biden's campaign.

I think that covers all the necessary points and includes the morally framed words. I'll make sure the summary is concise and within the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, issued an apology for grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck while the man attempted to ask him about his support for President Obama’s agenda. Etheridge expressed deep regret for his actions, stating he had always strived to treat people with respect and promote civil public discourse. The incident, captured on video, showed Etheridge repeatedly asking the young man to identify himself before grabbing him and the camera. The video, widely circulated by conservative outlets, sparked criticism, with a Republican spokesman calling Etheridge’s behavior “unbecoming” of a member of Congress. Etheridge, who represents a conservative district, faces re-election challenges. Meanwhile, Vice President Biden resumed the White House’s gun control campaign by pushing for executive action and legislative efforts.
