Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the content. The article is about Representative Bob Etheridge apologizing for grabbing a young man. The young man was trying to ask him about supporting Obama's agenda. There's a video showing the incident, which went viral. 

First, I should identify the morally framed words. The user mentioned words like "apology," "grabbing," "intrusive," "partisan," "poor response," "civil," "conduct," "unbecoming," "respect," and "service." These words carry moral weight, so I need to include them in the summary.

Now, the summary needs to be concise, around 200 words. I should mention Etheridge's apology, the incident with the young man, the video, and the reactions. Also, include the political context, like his district and re-election chances. I need to make sure the moral terms are preserved to reflect the author's framing.

I'll structure it by starting with Etheridge's apology, then describe the incident, the spread of the video, the reactions from Republicans, and end with his political standing. I'll make sure to use the identified moral words to maintain the tone.

Let me check the word count as I go. I need to be brief but cover all key points. Also, ensure that the summary flows naturally and includes all necessary details without being too lengthy.

Wait, I should also mention the young man's attempt to ask about Obama's agenda and Etheridge's request for identification. Including the part about the second person with another camera adds context. And the spread via Breitbart and the Republican committee is important for the political angle.

I think I've covered all the main points. Let me put it all together, ensuring the moral words are included and the summary is within the word limit.

**Summary:**

Representative Bob Etheridge issued an apology for grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck while the man attempted to ask him about his support for President Obama’s agenda. Etheridge regretted his “poor response” and emphasized his commitment to promoting “civil public discourse.” The incident, captured on video, showed Etheridge repeatedly asking the young man to identify himself before grabbing him. The video, made public by conservative publisher Andrew Breitbart, sparked widespread attention and criticism, with Republican spokesman Jon Thompson calling Etheridge’s conduct “unbecoming of a member of Congress.” Etheridge, representing a conservative district, faces re-election challenges but is not a top Republican target. His district narrowly supported Obama in the last election. The incident highlights the partisan nature of politics and the importance of respectful interaction in public discourse. END OF SUMMARY.
