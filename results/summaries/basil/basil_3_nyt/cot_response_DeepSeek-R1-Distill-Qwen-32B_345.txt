Alright, so the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. First, I need to identify all the morally framed words in the text. Then, I have to write a concise summary that preserves those moral framings.

Okay, looking at the article, I see words like "apology," "grabbing," "intrusive," "partisan," "poor response," "civil," "respect," "unbecoming," and "challenge." These words carry moral weight, so I should note each one.

Next, the summary needs to be under 200 words and include as many of these words as possible. I should focus on the key events: Etheridge grabbing the man, his apology, the context of the encounter, the video's spread, reactions, and the political implications.

I need to make sure the summary flows well while incorporating the moral terms. I'll start by stating Etheridge's apology, then describe the incident, his regret, the video's details, the political response, and end with the implications for his re-election.

I should avoid adding any extra information not in the article and keep it neutral but highlighting the moral aspects. Let me structure it step by step to ensure all points are covered concisely.

**STEP 1:**  
* Apology  
* Grabbing  
* Intrusive  
* Partisan  
* Poor response  
* Civil  
* Respect  
* Unbecoming  
* Challenge  

**SUMMARY:**  
Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, issued an apology after a video showed him grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck as the man asked about his support for President Obama’s agenda. Etheridge regretted his reaction, emphasizing his commitment to treating people with respect and promoting civil discourse. The young man, wearing a jacket and tie, approached Etheridge on a sidewalk and asked if he fully supported Obama’s agenda. Etheridge repeatedly asked the man to identify himself before grabbing him and the camera. A second person recorded the incident, which was widely shared online and criticized by Republicans, with one calling Etheridge’s behavior “unbecoming” of a congressman. Etheridge, who faces a re-election challenge, has historically won his district by a large margin, though it is not a top Republican target. The incident highlights tensions in partisan politics and the importance of respectful public discourse. END OF SUMMARY.
