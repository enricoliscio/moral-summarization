SUMMARY:
Representative Bob Etheridge, Democrat of North Carolina, issued an apology for his inappropriate reaction to a young man's attempt to question him on his support for President Obama's agenda. The video, which received widespread attention, shows Mr. Etheridge grabbing the young man by the hand, arm, and neck as he repeatedly asks for his identity. The congressman acknowledged his action as a "poor response" and apologized for not upholding a civil public discourse. He deeply regrets his actions and takes responsibility for his unbecoming conduct. The incident has sparked criticism from Republicans, with Jon Thompson, a Republican spokesman, stating, "Bob Etheridge has lost it." The apology comes as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. pushes for gun control legislation and executive action. Mr. Etheridge, facing re-election in a conservative district, now faces scrutiny for his actions. END OF SUMMARY.
