Okay, I need to help the user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. The article is about Representative Bob Etheridge apologizing for grabbing a young man. The key points are the incident, the apology, the context of the interaction, and the political implications.

First, I should identify the morally framed words the author used: grabbing, respect, promote, actions, conduct. I need to make sure these are included in the summary.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I should mention the apology, the incident, the congressman's statement about respect and promoting civil discourse, the man's question about Obama's agenda, the video's circulation, and the political response.

I'll structure it to highlight the moral aspects: his regret, the grabbing incident, the promotion of civil discourse, the actions taken, and the unbecoming conduct. Also, include the political fallout and the upcoming re-election challenge.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all necessary details without being too lengthy. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each moral term is appropriately placed.

SUMMARY: Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, issued an apology after a video showed him grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck as the man attempted to ask him about his support for President Obama’s agenda. Etheridge expressed regret for his actions, emphasizing his commitment to treating people with respect and promoting civil public discourse. The incident occurred when the young man, dressed in a jacket and tie, approached Etheridge on a sidewalk and asked if he fully supported Obama’s agenda. Etheridge repeatedly demanded the man identify himself before grabbing him and the camera. The video, which gained widespread attention after being posted by conservative publisher Andrew Breitbart, also showed a second person recording the encounter. Republican spokesperson Jon Thompson criticized Etheridge’s conduct, calling it unbecoming of a member of Congress. Etheridge, who faces a re-election challenge, has historically won his district by a significant margin, though his race is not a top Republican target. END OF SUMMARY.
