SUMMARY:
Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, apologized for his regretful reaction to a young man's question about supporting President Obama's agenda. The congressman's poor response, caught on video, showed him grabbing the man by the hand, arm, and neck, and repeatedly asking him to identify himself. Etheridge expressed deep regret for his actions, saying they did not justify a poor response, and reaffirmed his commitment to promoting a civil public discourse. The video, posted on a conservative website, sparked widespread attention and criticism, with a Republican spokesman calling Etheridge's conduct unbecoming of a member of Congress. Despite the controversy, Etheridge's re-election prospects remain strong in his conservative district. END OF SUMMARY.
