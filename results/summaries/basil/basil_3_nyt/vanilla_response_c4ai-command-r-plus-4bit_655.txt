SUMMARY: A video surfaced on Monday showing Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck as he tried to ask the congressman whether he supports President Obama's agenda. The incident has sparked controversy and led to an apology from Mr. Etheridge, who acknowledged that his reaction was inappropriate and apologized for not promoting a civil public discourse. The video, which was posted on a conservative website and circulated by the National Republican Congressional Committee, has received widespread attention and criticism. Mr. Etheridge's race for re-election is not among the top Republican targets in the country, but the incident has brought attention to his campaign. In other news, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. resumed the White House campaign for gun control, reporting on executive action taken by the administration and urging Congress to take up legislation. END OF SUMMARY.
