Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, apologized for grabbing a young man. The incident happened when the man approached him to ask about supporting Obama's agenda. The video shows Etheridge grabbing the man's hand, arm, and neck, and demanding to know his identity. Etheridge apologized, saying he regrets his actions and has always tried to treat people with respect, even in partisan times. He emphasized promoting civil discourse.

The young man was unidentified, wearing a jacket and tie. Another person with him recorded the incident, and the video went viral after being posted by a conservative publisher. Republicans criticized Etheridge, calling his conduct unbecoming. He's in a conservative district, not a top target for Republicans, having won by a large margin before. Also, Biden is resuming the gun control campaign.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects. The key moral points are Etheridge's regret, his commitment to respect and civility, the criticism from Republicans, and the context of his district and political situation.

I should start with the apology, describe the incident briefly, mention the video's spread, the criticism, and his political standing. Also, include Biden's part but maybe it's less central. I need to make sure the moral framing is clear: his regret and the expectation of respectful behavior in public discourse.

Let me structure it: Apology, incident details, video's impact, criticism, his political context, and the call for civility. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

I think that's a good plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.
