Okay, so I need to help the user with summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user provided a news article about Representative Bob Etheridge apologizing for grabbing a young man. The task is to identify morally framed words and then write a concise summary using those terms.

Starting with STEP 1: I need to find all single words that carry moral connotations. I'll go through the article and pick out words that relate to ethics, behavior, or judgment. Words like "apology," "grabbing," "intrusive," "partisan," "poor response," "civil," "unbecoming," "challenge," "executive action," and "legislation" stand out. These words carry judgments or imply right/wrong actions.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping the moral elements. The key points are Etheridge's apology, the incident where he grabbed the man, the context of the political environment, reactions from Republicans, and his upcoming re-election challenge. I should mention his regret, the partisanship, the poor response, and the call for civil discourse. Also, include the Republican criticism and the broader implications for his campaign.

I have to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the morally framed words identified. Let me structure it to start with the apology, describe the incident, mention the political context, the reactions, and conclude with the impact on his re-election. I'll avoid adding any new information beyond what's in the article and keep it concise.

Double-checking to ensure I haven't missed any key points or moral words. Everything seems covered. Time to put it all together in a clear, concise summary.

**SUMMARY:**  
Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, issued a public apology after a video showed him grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck as the man attempted to ask him about his support for President Obama’s agenda. Etheridge expressed regret for his actions, stating that he had always aimed to treat people with respect, regardless of political differences. The incident, captured on video, sparked widespread attention after being shared by conservative publisher Andrew Breitbart and the National Republican Congressional Committee. Critics, including Republican spokesman Jon Thompson, condemned Etheridge’s behavior as unbecoming of a member of Congress. Etheridge, who represents a conservative district, faces a re-election challenge but is not a top Republican target. His apology came as Vice President Biden resumed the administration’s campaign for gun control, highlighting executive action and urging congressional legislation. END OF SUMMARY.
