SUMMARY:

Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, issued an apology for his conduct after a video showed him grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck when asked if he supported President Obama's agenda. Etheridge's actions were caught on camera, and he repeatedly asked the young man to identify himself before grabbing him. The congressman's reaction was widely criticized, with a Republican spokesman calling his conduct "unbecoming of a member of Congress." Etheridge apologized, saying he "deeply and profoundly regret[s]" his reaction and promising to promote a civil public discourse. He acknowledged that his response was poor, despite the intrusive and partisan nature of the question. The incident has sparked widespread attention, with the video being circulated by the National Republican Congressional Committee.
