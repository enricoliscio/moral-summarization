SUMMARY: A shocking breach of civility and moral decency was exposed when a video surfaced of Representative Bob Etheridge, Democrat of North Carolina, assaulting a young man who merely asked about his support for President Obama's agenda. The congressman's aggressive response, which included grabbing the man by the hand, arm, and neck, is a stark contrast to his supposed commitment to "civil public discourse." Mr. Etheridge has since apologized, but his actions raise serious questions about his ability to represent his constituents with respect and integrity. This incident also highlights the increasingly partisan and intrusive nature of politics, where even a simple question can lead to an explosive reaction. It is a sad reflection on the state of our political discourse when a public official feels justified in using physical force to respond to a question, no matter how intrusive it may seem. This behavior is unbecoming of a member of Congress and undermines the very foundations of a democratic society built on mutual respect and civil discourse.

END OF SUMMARY.
