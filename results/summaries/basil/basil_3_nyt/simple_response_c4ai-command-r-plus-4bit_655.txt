SUMMARY: A shocking breach of civil public discourse and an unbecoming display of partisan politics have marred the reputation of Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina. In a disturbing video that has gone viral, the congressman is seen grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck, simply because the latter had asked him if he supports President Obama's agenda. The aggressive and unjustified response from Mr. Etheridge, who has served the people of North Carolina for seven terms, is a stark contrast to his statement where he advocates for civil public discourse and respect for people from all viewpoints. The incident has sparked outrage, with Republican spokesman Jon Thompson condemning Mr. Etheridge's conduct as "unbecoming of a member of Congress." The congressman has issued an apology, acknowledging his inappropriate reaction and expressing regret. The video, posted online by conservative publisher Andrew Breitbart, highlights the unfortunate reality of today's intrusive and partisan politics, where a simple question can lead to a physical altercation. This incident serves as a reminder that our political discourse should be based on mutual respect and civility, regardless of our differences in viewpoints.
END OF SUMMARY.
