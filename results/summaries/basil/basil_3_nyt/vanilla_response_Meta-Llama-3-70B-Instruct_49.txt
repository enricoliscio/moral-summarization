SUMMARY:

Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, has apologized for physically confronting a young man who approached him to ask if he supports President Obama's agenda. The incident, which was captured on video, shows Etheridge grabbing the man by the hand, arm, and neck, and repeatedly asking him to identify himself. The video was posted on a conservative website and circulated by the National Republican Congressional Committee, sparking widespread attention and criticism. Etheridge, a seven-term House member, expressed regret for his reaction, saying it was unbecoming of a member of Congress and that he will work to promote civil public discourse. The incident comes as Etheridge faces a re-election challenge in a conservative district.
