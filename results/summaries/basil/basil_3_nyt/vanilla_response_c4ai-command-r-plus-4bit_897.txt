SUMMARY: A video surfaced on Monday showing Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, grabbing a young man by the hand, arm, and neck as he tried to ask the congressman whether he supports President Obama's agenda. The incident occurred last week and was posted on a conservative website, receiving widespread attention. In the video, the congressman is seen asking the young man to identify himself repeatedly before grabbing his camera and physically restraining him. Etheridge issued an apology on Monday, expressing regret for his actions and stating that he always strives to treat people with respect regardless of political viewpoints. The incident has sparked criticism from Republicans, with spokesman Jon Thompson stating that Etheridge's conduct is unbecoming of a member of Congress. Despite representing a conservative district, Etheridge won his previous election by a significant margin and is not considered a top target for Republicans. The article also briefly mentions Vice President Biden's recent push for gun control.
END OF SUMMARY.
