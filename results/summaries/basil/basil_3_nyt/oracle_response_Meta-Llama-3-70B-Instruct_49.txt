SUMMARY:

Representative Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from North Carolina, issued an apology for his unacceptable conduct towards a young man who approached him to ask about his support for President Obama's agenda. The video, which went viral, shows Etheridge grabbing the young man by the hand, arm, and neck, and repeatedly asking him to identify himself. Etheridge's actions were a poor response to a legitimate question, and he rightly apologized for not promoting a civil public discourse. He acknowledged that his reaction was unbecoming of a member of Congress and fell short of treating people with respect, regardless of their viewpoints. The incident has sparked widespread attention, with Republicans criticizing Etheridge's conduct as unbecoming of a congressman. Etheridge's apology is a step towards promoting respect and civility in politics.

END OF SUMMARY.
