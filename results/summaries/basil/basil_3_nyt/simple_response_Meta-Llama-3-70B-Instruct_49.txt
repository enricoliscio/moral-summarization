SUMMARY:

Democratic Representative Bob Etheridge of North Carolina has apologized for physically confronting a young man who asked if he supported President Obama's agenda. The incident, caught on video, shows Etheridge grabbing the man by the hand, arm, and neck, and demanding to know his identity. Etheridge's actions have been widely criticized, with Republicans calling his conduct "unbecoming of a member of Congress." The congressman's apology acknowledges that his reaction was wrong and promises to promote civil public discourse. The incident has sparked concerns about the tone of political discourse and the need for respect in political interactions. As a moral expert, I condemn Etheridge's behavior as a violation of the principles of respect, dignity, and civility that should guide our political interactions. His apology is a step in the right direction, but it also highlights the need for greater self-reflection and accountability among our elected officials.

END OF SUMMARY.
