SUMMARY:

In a disturbing display of aggression, Representative Bob Etheridge (D-NC) was caught on camera physically assaulting a young man who approached him to ask about his support for President Obama's agenda. The congressman grabbed the man by the hand, arm, and neck, demanding to know his identity. This unacceptable behavior is a stark departure from the respectful discourse that should characterize our political interactions. Etheridge has since issued an apology, acknowledging that his reaction was unjustified and promising to promote a more civil public discourse. However, his actions have sparked widespread outrage, with many calling for greater accountability from our elected officials. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of maintaining dignity and respect in our political engagements, even in the face of disagreement or provocation.

END OF SUMMARY.
