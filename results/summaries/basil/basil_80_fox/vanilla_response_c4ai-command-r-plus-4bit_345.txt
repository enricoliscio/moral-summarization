SUMMARY: President Trump criticized Huma Abedin, aide to Hillary Clinton, for potential security breaches in handling classified material, calling for the Justice Department to take action. He highlighted Abedin's disregard for security protocols, including forwarding sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account and sending government laptop passwords to the same account, which was later hacked. Trump drew a comparison with the case of a Navy sailor imprisoned for taking photos in a nuclear submarine, suggesting a double standard. The recent release of Abedin's emails from her estranged husband's laptop has brought these issues to light, with former FBI Director James Comey stating that Abedin forwarded emails for Clinton's convenience. Comey had previously criticized Clinton for her "extremely careless" handling of classified information. Trump's tweet demands justice and action from the "Deep State" Justice Department.
END OF SUMMARY.
