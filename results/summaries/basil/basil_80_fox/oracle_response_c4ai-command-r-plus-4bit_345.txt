SUMMARY: President Trump slammed Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin, calling on the 'Deep State' Justice Department to act on potential security issues. Trump accused Abedin of 'disregarding' security protocols, highlighting that she put classified passwords at risk by forwarding them to her personal Yahoo email account, which was later hacked. Abedin also sent government laptop passwords to her Yahoo account. Trump drew a comparison with the case of a U.S. Navy Sailor who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos, suggesting a 'double standard' in the lack of punishment for Clinton and her aides. The recent release of Abedin's emails by the State Department has brought these security issues to light, with former FBI Director James Comey acknowledging that Abedin forwarded emails to her husband for printing. Comey previously described Clinton's handling of classified emails as 'extremely careless'. Trump's tweet demands action from the 'Deep State' Justice Department, calling for an investigation into Abedin's actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
