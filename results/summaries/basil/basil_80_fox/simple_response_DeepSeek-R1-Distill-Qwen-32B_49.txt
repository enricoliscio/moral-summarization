Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me start by reading the article carefully. 

The article is about Trump criticizing Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton. He's calling her "crooked" and suggesting the "Deep State" Justice Department should act because she mishandled classified material. He compares her to a sailor who went to jail for taking unauthorized photos. 

I should note that Trump is highlighting a double standard, implying that while someone else was punished, Abedin wasn't. The article mentions that the State Department released some emails from Abedin's account, which were found on her estranged husband's laptop. Some were classified, and she forwarded sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. 

Also, she sent passwords for her government laptop to her Yahoo account, and Yahoo was hacked in 2013. Comey was involved in the Clinton email investigation and mentioned that Abedin sent emails to Weiner for printing, which affected the 2016 election. 

I need to make sure the summary includes all these points: Trump's criticism, the comparison to the sailor, the email dump, classified materials, the hacking incident, and the impact on the election. Also, the moral framing is about accountability and a double standard, so I should highlight that. 

Let me structure this into a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words. I'll mention Trump's tweet, the comparison, the released emails, the classified nature, the password incident, the hacking, Comey's role, and the implication of a double standard. 

I should make sure the summary flows logically, starting with Trump's action, then the details of Abedin's actions, the consequences, and the moral implication. 

Wait, the user also mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer and moral expert, so I need to ensure the summary not only summarizes the facts but also conveys the moral judgment presented in the article, which is that Trump is pointing out a lack of accountability for Abedin compared to others who were punished. 

I should make sure to include that Trump is calling out the Justice Department and highlighting the contrast between the sailor's punishment and Abedin's lack of consequences. 

Alright, putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's concise and hits all the key points with the moral framing intact.
