SUMMARY: President Trump has slammed Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, for her handling of classified material, calling for the 'Deep State' Justice Department to take action. He highlighted the double standard in the justice system, citing the case of a U.S. Navy Sailor who was imprisoned for taking photos in a submarine, while Clinton and her aides have faced no punishment. Recently released emails from Abedin's account revealed classified information and sensitive State Department emails being forwarded to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. This raises serious security concerns and questions of potential wrongdoing. Former FBI Director James Comey, who led the Clinton email investigation, had previously criticized Clinton for being "extremely careless" with classified information. Trump's tweet shines a light on the injustice and calls for a fair and equal application of the law, regardless of an individual's political affiliations or status.
