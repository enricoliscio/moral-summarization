SUMMARY: President Trump slammed Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, for her handling of classified material, calling on the 'Deep State' Justice Department to act. Trump accused Abedin of disregarding security protocols, highlighting that she put classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents. He drew a comparison with the case of a U.S. Navy Sailor who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos, suggesting a double standard in punishment. The State Department's recent email dump revealed Abedin's forwarded sensitive emails and passwords to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. This raises issues of potential security breaches. Former FBI Director James Comey, who led the Clinton email investigation, testified that Abedin forwarded emails to her husband, Anthony Weiner, for printing. Comey had previously called Clinton 'extremely careless' in her handling of classified information. Trump's tweet demands justice, suggesting charges should be brought against Abedin, Comey, and others.
END OF SUMMARY.
