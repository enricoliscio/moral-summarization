SUMMARY:

President Trump has called for the Justice Department to take action against Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, over potential security issues related to her handling of classified material. Trump tweeted that Abedin had "disregarded basic security protocols" and put classified passwords in the hands of foreign agents. He compared her situation to that of U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos on a submarine. The tweet comes after the State Department released a batch of emails from Abedin's account, including at least four marked "classified." Abedin had forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. Trump also mentioned former FBI Director James Comey, who led the Clinton email investigation. The president appears to be suggesting a double standard in the handling of security breaches.
