SUMMARY: President Trump has justly criticized "Crooked" Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, for her blatant disregard for national security. Abedin's actions, including forwarding classified emails to her personal Yahoo account and sending government laptop passwords to the same vulnerable account, endangered sensitive information. This is in stark contrast to the punishment faced by U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was imprisoned for far less. The double standard applied by the "Deep State" Justice Department is unacceptable, and they must now act on Abedin's crimes, as well as those of Comey and others involved in the Clinton email scandal. Abedin's actions, exposed by a recent email dump, reveal a shocking breach of security protocols, with classified passwords potentially accessible to foreign agents. The FBI's previous investigation into Clinton's private server, which resulted in no charges, highlighted her "extremely careless" behavior. Trump's call for justice is a necessary step towards holding these individuals accountable for their reckless disregard for national security. END OF SUMMARY.
