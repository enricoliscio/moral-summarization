Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The user provided a detailed article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump criticizing Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton, for mishandling classified information. He's calling on the Justice Department to act, comparing her actions to a sailor who went to prison for similar issues. The article mentions that Abedin forwarded classified emails to her personal account, which was later hacked. This led to an FBI investigation that affected the 2016 election.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words used by the author: issues, dump, accused, disregarding, put, prison, taking, double, punishment, forwarded, hacked, sent, investigation, investigated, case, charges, careless.

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. I'll start by mentioning Trump's accusations against Abedin, using "accused" and "disregarding." Then, I'll note the security issues and the comparison to the sailor in prison. Next, I'll explain how Abedin forwarded emails and sent passwords, leading to a hack. I'll mention the investigation by the FBI and how it reopened the case against Clinton, highlighting her carelessness. Finally, I'll tie it back to Trump's call for punishment and the double standard he perceives.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it includes the necessary moral terms without making it too verbose. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: President Trump has accused Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, of disregarding security protocols by putting classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents, calling for the "Deep State" Justice Department to act. He compared her actions to those of a U.S. Navy sailor who faced prison for taking unauthorized photos inside a nuclear submarine, highlighting a perceived double standard in punishment. The State Department recently released a batch of emails from Abedin's account, which were found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner's laptop. At least four documents were classified, and Abedin had forwarded sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. She also sent passwords for her government laptop to her Yahoo account in 2009. Former FBI Director James Comey revealed that Abedin forwarded emails to Weiner for printing, which were given to Clinton. The investigation into these emails reopened the case against Clinton during the 2016 presidential race, with Comey describing her handling of classified emails as "extremely careless." Trump's tweet underscores his call for justice, emphasizing the need for punishment in light of the security issues involved. END OF SUMMARY.
