SUMMARY: President Trump slammed Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, for her handling of classified material, calling on the 'Deep State' Justice Department to act. Trump accused Abedin of 'disregarding' security protocols, putting classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents. He drew a comparison with the case of a U.S. Navy Sailor who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos, suggesting a 'double standard' in the lack of punishment for Clinton and her aides. A recent email dump revealed Abedin forwarded sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. Abedin also sent government laptop passwords to her Yahoo account. Former FBI Director James Comey, who led the Clinton email investigation, previously called Clinton 'extremely careless' in her handling of classified emails. Trump's tweet demands justice, asking why no charges have been brought against Abedin, Clinton, or even Comey himself.
END OF SUMMARY.
