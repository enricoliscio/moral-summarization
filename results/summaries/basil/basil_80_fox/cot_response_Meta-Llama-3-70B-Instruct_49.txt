SUMMARY:
President Trump slammed "Crooked" Hillary Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, on Twitter, calling on the "Deep State" Justice Department to take action against her for allegedly disregarding basic security protocols. Abedin had forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo email account, which was later hacked, and sent classified passwords to her Yahoo account. Trump drew a comparison with the case of U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos on a nuclear submarine. The President suggested a double standard, as Abedin and others involved in the Clinton email scandal have not faced punishment. Trump's tweet comes after a recent email dump revealed at least four classified documents on Abedin's account. Former FBI Director James Comey had previously described Clinton's handling of classified emails as "extremely careless."
