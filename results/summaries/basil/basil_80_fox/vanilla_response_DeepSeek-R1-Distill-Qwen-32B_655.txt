Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump criticizing Huma Abedin. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article says Trump tweeted about Huma Abedin, calling her "Crooked" Hillary's aide, and mentioned security issues with classified material. He compared her situation to a sailor who was jailed for taking unauthorized photos. Trump is urging the Justice Department, which he refers to as the "Deep State," to act. 

The State Department released some emails from Abedin's account that were found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner's laptop. Some of these emails were classified. She also forwarded sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. She sent government laptop passwords to her Yahoo account in 2009, and Yahoo was hacked in 2013. 

James Comey, the former FBI Director, said Abedin forwarded emails to Weiner so he could print them for Clinton. These emails were discovered during the 2016 investigation, which affected the election by reopening the case against Clinton. Comey called her handling of classified emails "extremely careless."

So, the key points are:
- Trump criticizes Huma Abedin for mishandling classified info.
- Compares her to a sailor who was jailed, implying a double standard.
- Emails from Abedin's account were released, some classified.
- She forwarded sensitive emails to a personal account, which was hacked.
- Comey's role in the Clinton email investigation and his comments on her carelessness.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should make sure to include Trump's call for the Justice Department to act, the details about the emails and hacking, and the implications for the 2016 election.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with Trump's tweet, mention the comparison to the sailor, then the release of emails, the classified nature, her forwarding to Yahoo, the hacking incident, and Comey's involvement and comments. Finally, note the impact on the 2016 election.

I should make sure it's concise and covers all main points without going into too much detail. Also, check the word count to stay within 200 words.
