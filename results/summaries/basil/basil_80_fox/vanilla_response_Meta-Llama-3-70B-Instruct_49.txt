SUMMARY:

President Trump has called for the "Deep State" Justice Department to take action against Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, over potential security issues in her handling of classified material. Trump tweeted that Abedin had "disregarded basic security protocols" and put classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents. He compared her situation to that of U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos on a nuclear submarine. The president's tweet comes after the release of a batch of emails from Abedin's account, which included at least four classified documents. Abedin had also forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo email account, which was later hacked. Trump's tweet suggests a double standard, as Abedin has not faced punishment for her actions.
