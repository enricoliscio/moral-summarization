SUMMARY:

President Trump is calling for the "Deep State" Justice Department to take action against Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, for her alleged mishandling of classified material. Trump tweeted that Abedin "put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents" and suggested she should be jailed for her actions. He compared Abedin's situation to that of U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos on a submarine. Trump's tweet comes after the release of a batch of emails from Abedin's account, which included at least four classified documents. Abedin had also forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo email account, which was later hacked. Trump is implying a double standard, as Abedin and Clinton have not faced punishment for their actions, while others have been held accountable.

END OF SUMMARY.
