Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should go through the article and identify all the morally charged words. Let me read through it again.

The article starts with Trump slamming Huma Abedin, calling her "crooked" and mentioning the "Deep State" DOJ. So "crooked" is definitely a moral term. "Deep State" is also a term that implies hidden, corrupt forces. 

Then, Trump accuses Abedin of disregarding "basic security protocols" and putting " Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents." So "disregarding," "security protocols," "classified passwords," "foreign agents" â€“ those are all framed in a negative light.

He also compares this to the case of Kristian Saucier, the sailor who was imprisoned, suggesting a "double standard." That's a moral judgment about fairness.

The article mentions that the State Department released emails from Abedin's account found on her estranged husband's laptop. It notes that four documents were "classified," so "classified" is another term with moral implications because it's about security and confidentiality.

Abedin forwarded "sensitive State Department emails" to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. "Sensitive" and "hacked" carry moral weight because they relate to security breaches and trust issues.

Yahoo being hacked and all accounts affected is another point of moral concern about data security and privacy.

James Comey is mentioned as the former FBI Director who found more of Clinton's messages, which reopened the case against her. Comey called Clinton "extremely careless" in handling classified emails, which is a moral judgment about her responsibility.

Putting it all together, the summary needs to include these terms and convey the moral framing that Trump and the article are using to criticize Abedin and Clinton. I should make sure to highlight the accusations, the security issues, the comparison to the sailor's case, and the involvement of the "Deep State" DOJ. Also, mentioning Comey's role and the reopening of the case ties into the moral narrative about accountability and fairness.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include as many of these morally framed words as possible without making it too verbose. I should structure it to flow logically, starting with Trump's accusations, then the specifics of Abedin's actions, the comparison, and the implications for Clinton and the DOJ.
