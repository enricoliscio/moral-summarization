SUMMARY:
President Trump slammed Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, calling for the "Deep State" Justice Department to take action against her for potential security breaches. He accused Abedin of "disregarding" basic security protocols by mishandling "classified" information, including passwords. Abedin's emails, discovered on her husband Anthony Weiner's laptop, caused controversy in the 2016 election when the FBI reopened the case against Clinton. Trump drew a contrast with the case of Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, imprisoned for taking "unauthorized" photos, suggesting a double standard. Abedin also forwarded sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later "hacked." Former FBI Director James Comey described Clinton's handling of emails as "extremely careless." The recent release of Abedin's emails by the State Department has brought the issue back into the spotlight, with Trump calling for justice.
END OF SUMMARY.
