SUMMARY:

President Trump slammed Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin, calling her "crooked" and demanding the "Deep State" Justice Department take action against her for mishandling classified material. Trump tweeted that Abedin had put classified passwords in the hands of foreign agents, and that she should be jailed for her actions. He drew a comparison to U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos on a nuclear submarine, suggesting a double standard. The tweet came after the State Department released a batch of emails from Abedin's account, including at least four marked "classified." Abedin had also forwarded sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. Trump's criticism echoes his long-held belief that Clinton and her aides were given preferential treatment by the Justice Department. The president's tweet implies that Abedin's actions were a serious breach of national security and that she should face consequences.
