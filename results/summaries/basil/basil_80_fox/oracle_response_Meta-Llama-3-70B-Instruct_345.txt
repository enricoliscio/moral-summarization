SUMMARY:

President Trump slammed "Crooked" Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, accusing her of disregarding basic security protocols and putting classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents. He called on the "Deep State" Justice Department to act, suggesting a double standard in the handling of sensitive material. Trump referenced the case of U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was put in prison for taking unauthorized photos inside a nuclear submarine, implying that Abedin's actions warranted similar punishment. The president's tweet came after a recent email dump revealed that Abedin forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. Trump also mentioned former FBI Director James Comey, who led the Clinton email investigation and described Clinton's handling of classified emails as "extremely careless." The president's criticism highlights the need for accountability in the handling of classified material and the importance of a thorough investigation into these serious issues. END OF SUMMARY.
