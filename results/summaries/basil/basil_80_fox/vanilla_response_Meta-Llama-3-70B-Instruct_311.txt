SUMMARY:

President Trump has called for the "Deep State" Justice Department to take action against Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, over potential security issues in her handling of classified material. Trump tweeted that Abedin had disregarded basic security protocols, putting classified passwords in the hands of foreign agents, and suggested that she should be jailed. The tweet comes after a recent email dump revealed that Abedin had forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo email account, which was later hacked. Trump also referenced the case of U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos on a submarine, implying a double standard. The emails in question were discovered on a laptop belonging to Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, during an FBI investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
