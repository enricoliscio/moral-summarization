STEP 1:
*Crooked*
*Jail*
*Deep*
*Disregarding*
*Unauthorized*
*Crooked* (again, as it's used to describe Hillary Clinton)
*Extremely*
*Careless*

SUMMARY:
President Trump slammed "Crooked" Hillary Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, on Twitter, accusing her of "disregarding basic security protocols" and putting "Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents." Trump called for the "Deep State" Justice Department to take action, suggesting a double standard compared to the punishment of U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was jailed for taking unauthorized photos on a submarine. The president's tweet follows the release of a batch of emails from Abedin's account, which included at least four classified documents. Abedin also forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo email account, which was later hacked. Trump implied that Abedin's actions were "extremely careless" and warranted punishment, unlike Clinton and her aides. END OF SUMMARY.
