SUMMARY: President Trump has justly criticized Huma Abedin, a former aide to the notoriously dishonest Hillary Clinton, for her reckless handling of classified information. Abedin's actions endangered national security by forwarding sensitive emails and classified passwords to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. This is a clear double standard compared to the lenient treatment of Clinton and her aides by the "Deep State" Justice Department. Abedin's actions are reminiscent of the case of Kristian Saucier, a U.S. Navy Sailor who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos, yet Clinton and her aides have faced no consequences. The recent release of Abedin's emails by the State Department highlights the need for the Justice Department to take action and hold those responsible accountable, including former FBI Director James Comey, who allowed Clinton to escape punishment despite her blatant disregard for security protocols. Abedin's actions were not only irresponsible but also potentially criminal, and it is time for the "Deep State" to be held to the same standards of justice as ordinary Americans.
END OF SUMMARY.
