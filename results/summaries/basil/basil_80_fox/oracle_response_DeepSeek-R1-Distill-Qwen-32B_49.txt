Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article talks about President Trump criticizing Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton, for mishandling classified information. Trump is calling for the Justice Department to act, mentioning a "Deep State" and comparing it to a sailor who went to prison for taking unauthorized photos. He's pointing out a double standard where others aren't punished while a sailor is. 

The author used words like "issues," "dump," "accused," "disregarding," "put," "prison," "taking," "double," "punishment," "forwarded," "hacked," "sent," "investigation," "investigated," "case," "charges," "careless." I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

So, the summary should mention Trump's accusations against Abedin, the security issues with classified material, the email dump, her forwarding emails to her personal account, the hacking incident, and the comparison to the sailor. Also, mention the Justice Department's inaction and the implications for the 2016 election.

I should structure it to highlight the moral aspects, like the disregard for security, the hacking, the forwarded emails, and the lack of punishment. Make sure to include the key morally framed words without making the summary too longâ€”under 200 words.

Let me start drafting: Trump criticizes Huma Abedin for security issues, accuses her of putting classified passwords into foreign agents' hands. He mentions the email dump and her forwarding sensitive emails to her personal account, which was hacked. Compares this to the sailor who went to prison, pointing out a double standard. The Justice Department hasn't acted, and this relates to the 2016 investigation where Comey found more emails, reopening the case. Clinton was called careless. Need to include all these points concisely with the moral words.

I think that covers all the necessary points and includes the key moral terms. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, accusing her of disregarding security protocols by putting classified passwords into foreign agents' hands. He called on the "Deep State" Justice Department to act, comparing her case to a sailor who went to prison for unauthorized photos. Abedin was accused of forwarding sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. She sent government laptop passwords to her Yahoo account in 2009, and Yahoo was hacked in 2013. Former FBI Director James Comey testified that Abedin forwarded emails to her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, for Clinton. This investigation reopened the case against Clinton in 2016, with Comey calling her "extremely careless" in handling classified emails. Trump highlighted the lack of punishment for Abedin and others, suggesting a double standard. END OF SUMMARY.
