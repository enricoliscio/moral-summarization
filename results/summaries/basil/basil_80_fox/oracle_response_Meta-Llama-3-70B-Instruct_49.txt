SUMMARY:

President Trump slammed "Crooked" Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, accusing her of disregarding basic security protocols and putting classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Trump called on the "Deep State" Justice Department to act, citing a double standard compared to the punishment of U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos inside a nuclear submarine. The president's tweet follows the release of a batch of emails from Abedin's account, which showed that she forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo email account before it was hacked. At least four of the documents were marked "classified." Abedin also sent passwords for her government laptop to her Yahoo account, which was compromised in a hack. Trump suggested that Abedin's handling of classified material was "careless" and that she should face punishment. The president's criticism comes as part of a larger investigation into the Clinton email scandal.
