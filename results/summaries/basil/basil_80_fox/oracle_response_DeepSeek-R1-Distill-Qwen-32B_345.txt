Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the listed morally charged words as possible. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The article is about President Trump criticizing Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton, for mishandling classified information. He's calling on the Justice Department to act, suggesting a double standard since others, like a sailor, were punished for similar actions. The article mentions that emails were released, some were classified, and Abedin forwarded sensitive emails to her personal account, which was later hacked. This affected the 2016 election as the FBI's investigation into Clinton was reopened.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list provided: issues, dump, accused, disregarding, put, prison, taking, double, punishment, forwarded, hacked, sent, investigation, investigated, case, charges, careless.

I should ensure that these words are included in the summary. I'll structure the summary to highlight Trump's accusations, Abedin's actions, the security issues, and the comparison to the sailor's punishment. I'll also mention the email dump and the hacking incident.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to keep it under 200 words and include the moral terms. I'll start by stating Trump's criticism, then detail Abedin's actions, the consequences, and the comparison. I'll end with the implications of the case and Clinton's carelessness.

I should check that each morally framed word is appropriately placed without making the summary too verbose. I need to maintain clarity while incorporating the necessary terms. Once done, I'll count the words to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, for disregarding security protocols by putting classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents. He called on the "Deep State" Justice Department to act, highlighting a double standard compared to the punishment faced by a U.S. Navy sailor who took unauthorized photos of a nuclear submarine and was sent to prison. Trump's tweet followed the release of classified emails from Abedin’s account, which were found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner’s laptop. Abedin had forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. She also sent passwords for her government laptop to her Yahoo account in 2009. The email dump revealed that Abedin forwarded emails to Weiner for printing, which were then given to Clinton. This investigation shook the 2016 presidential race when the FBI reopened the case against Clinton, months after former FBI Director James Comey initially ruled out charges. Comey described Clinton as "extremely careless" in handling classified emails. The case highlights issues of security, punishment, and the consequences of mishandling classified information. END OF SUMMARY.
