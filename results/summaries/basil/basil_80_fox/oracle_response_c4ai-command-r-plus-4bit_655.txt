SUMMARY: President Trump slammed Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, for her handling of classified material, calling on the "Deep State" DOJ to act. Trump accused Abedin of disregarding security protocols, putting classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents. He drew a comparison with the case of a U.S. Navy Sailor who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos, suggesting a double standard in punishment. The State Department released Abedin's emails, which were found on her husband's laptop, revealing classified documents and sensitive information. Abedin forwarded emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked, and sent government laptop passwords to the same account. James Comey, the former FBI Director, believed Abedin forwarded emails for Clinton's convenience. Comey had previously called Clinton "extremely careless" in her handling of classified information. Trump's tweet highlights potential issues in the handling of classified material and calls for justice. END OF SUMMARY.
