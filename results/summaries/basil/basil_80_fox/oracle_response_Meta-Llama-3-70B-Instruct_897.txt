SUMMARY:

President Trump slammed "crooked" Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, accusing her of disregarding basic security protocols and putting classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents. He called on the "Deep State" Justice Department to act, citing a double standard in punishment compared to U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos inside a nuclear submarine. The president's tweet comes after a recent email dump revealed at least four classified documents on Abedin's account, which she forwarded to her personal Yahoo email account before it was hacked. Abedin also sent passwords for her government laptop to her Yahoo account, raising security issues. Trump suggested that Abedin's actions warranted punishment, similar to Saucier's case. The controversy surrounding Abedin's emails, which were investigated by former FBI Director James Comey, led to the reopening of the case against Clinton, with Comey calling her "extremely careless" in her handling of classified emails.

END OF SUMMARY.
