Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump criticizing Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton's aide, and calling on the Justice Department to act. He mentions that she mishandled classified materials and compares it to a sailor who was jailed for taking unauthorized photos. 

First, I should identify the main points. Trump tweeted about Huma Abedin disregarding security protocols, putting classified passwords into foreign agents' hands. He referenced the sailor case to highlight a double standard. The State Department released emails from Abedin's account found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner's laptop. Some emails were classified, and she forwarded sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. 

Also, she sent her government laptop's passwords to her Yahoo account in 2009, and Yahoo was hacked in 2013. Former FBI Director Comey mentioned that Abedin forwarded emails to Weiner for printing and giving to Clinton. This email dump affected the 2016 election when Comey reopened the investigation, causing Clinton's case to be revisited.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start with Trump's tweet, mention the security issues, the email dump, the classified materials, the hacking incident, and the impact on the election. I'll also note Comey's role and the comparison to the sailor case. Make sure to include all key elements without getting too detailed.
