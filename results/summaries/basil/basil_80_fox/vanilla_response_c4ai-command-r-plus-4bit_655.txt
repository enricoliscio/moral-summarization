SUMMARY: President Trump criticized Huma Abedin, aide to Hillary Clinton, for potential security breaches in handling classified material. He highlighted how Abedin put classified passwords at risk and contrasted her actions with those of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking photos in a submarine. Trump called on the "Deep State" Justice Department to act, suggesting a double standard in punishment. The criticism follows the release of Abedin's emails from a laptop belonging to her husband, Anthony Weiner, some of which were marked "classified." Abedin also forwarded sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. James Comey, former FBI Director, testified that Abedin likely forwarded emails for Clinton's convenience. Comey previously criticized Clinton for being "extremely careless" with classified information.
END OF SUMMARY.
