SUMMARY:

President Trump has called for the "Deep State" Justice Department to take action against Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, for her alleged mishandling of classified material. Trump tweeted that Abedin "put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents" and suggested that she should be jailed for her actions. He drew a comparison to the case of U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos on a nuclear submarine. The president's tweet comes after a recent email dump revealed that Abedin had forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. Trump's criticism of Abedin and the Justice Department implies that there is a double standard at play, where Clinton and her aides have not been held accountable for their actions. The president's moral framing suggests that those who mishandle classified information should be held to the same standard, regardless of their political affiliation.
