SUMMARY: 
President Trump slammed Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin, calling for the "Deep State" Justice Department to act on potential security breaches. Trump accused Abedin of "disregarding" security protocols and putting "Classified" passwords at risk. He drew a comparison to the case of a U.S. Navy Sailor imprisoned for taking "unauthorized" photos, suggesting a double standard. Abedin's emails, discovered on her husband Anthony Weiner's laptop, included "classified" information and sensitive State Department material. Former FBI Director James Comey had previously described Clinton's handling of emails as "extremely careless." Abedin's actions shook the 2016 election, leading to the "reopened" case against Clinton. Trump's tweet demands justice, calling out Comey and others.
END OF SUMMARY.
