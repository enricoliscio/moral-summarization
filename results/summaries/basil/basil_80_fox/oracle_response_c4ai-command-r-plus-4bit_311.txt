SUMMARY: President Trump slammed Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin, calling for the "Deep State" Justice Department to act on potential security issues and her handling of classified material. Trump accused Abedin of "disregarding" security protocols and putting classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents. He drew a comparison to the case of a U.S. Navy Sailor who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos, suggesting a double standard in punishment. The recent email dump revealed Abedin forwarded sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked, and sent passwords for her government laptop to the same account. James Comey, who led the Clinton email investigation, previously testified that Abedin forwarded emails to her husband Anthony Weiner for printing. Comey had called Clinton "extremely careless" in her handling of classified emails on a private server. Trump's tweet highlights the potential issues of national security and the apparent disparity in how different individuals are punished.
END OF SUMMARY.
