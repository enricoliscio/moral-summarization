SUMMARY:

President Trump slammed "Crooked" Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin, accusing her of disregarding basic security protocols and putting classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Trump called on the "Deep State" Justice Department to act, suggesting a double standard is at play compared to the punishment of U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos inside a nuclear submarine. The president's tweet comes after the State Department released a batch of emails from Abedin's account, including at least four marked "classified." Abedin forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo email account, which was later hacked, and sent passwords for her government laptop to her Yahoo account. Trump's criticism is rooted in the investigation into Clinton's email scandal, which Comey described as "extremely careless." The president is demanding punishment for Abedin's alleged security breaches, citing the need for accountability.
