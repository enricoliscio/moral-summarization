SUMMARY:

President Trump slammed "Crooked" Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, accusing her of disregarding basic security protocols and putting classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Trump called on the "Deep State" Justice Department to take action, citing a double standard in the lack of punishment for Clinton and her aides compared to others, such as U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was put in prison for taking unauthorized photos inside a nuclear submarine. The president's tweet comes after a recent email dump revealed that Abedin forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo email account, which was later hacked. Trump suggested that Abedin's careless handling of classified material warranted punishment, similar to Saucier's case. The investigation into Abedin's emails has raised questions about her role in the Clinton email scandal, with former FBI Director James Comey having accused Abedin of forwarding emails to her husband for printing.

END OF SUMMARY.
