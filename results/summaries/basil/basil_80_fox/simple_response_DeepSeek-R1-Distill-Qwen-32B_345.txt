Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first. 

So, the article is about Trump criticizing Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton's aide, for mishandling classified information. He's calling on the Justice Department to take action, comparing it to a sailor who was jailed for taking unauthorized photos. The article mentions that some of Abedin's emails were classified and she forwarded sensitive emails to her personal account, which was later hacked. There's also mention of Comey's role in the investigation and how this affected the 2016 election.

I need to make sure the summary captures the key points: Trump's criticism, the security issues with Abedin's handling of classified material, the comparison to the sailor, the email dump, and the impact on the election. Also, I should maintain the moral tone, highlighting the potential double standard and the security risks involved.

I'll start by mentioning Trump's tweet and his call for the Justice Department to act. Then, I'll note the specific security lapses, like forwarding emails to a personal account and the hacking incident. I'll include the comparison to the sailor and the implication of a double standard. Finally, I'll touch on the political implications, such as the emails affecting the 2016 election.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each key point is addressed without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, for allegedly mishandling classified information, calling on the Justice Department to act. He compared her actions to those of a sailor jailed for taking unauthorized photos, suggesting a double standard. Emails from Abedin's account, released by the State Department, included classified documents and sensitive information she forwarded to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. Trump highlighted that Abedin sent passwords for her government laptop to her personal email, raising security concerns. Former FBI Director James Comey previously described Clinton as "extremely careless" in handling classified emails. The discovery of these emails during the 2016 investigation reignited scrutiny of Clinton's email practices, influencing the election narrative. Trump's tweet underscores his criticism of the "Deep State" and the perceived lack of accountability for Clinton and her associates. END OF SUMMARY.
