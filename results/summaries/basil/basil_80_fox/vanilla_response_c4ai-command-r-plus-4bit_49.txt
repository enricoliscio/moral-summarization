SUMMARY: President Trump criticized Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin, referring to her as "Crooked" and calling for the "Deep State" Justice Department to investigate potential security breaches in her handling of classified information. Trump highlighted Abedin's disregard for security protocols, including the forwarding of classified passwords to her personal Yahoo email account, which was later hacked. He drew a comparison to the case of Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos, suggesting a double standard in punishment. The State Department's recent release of Abedin's emails from her estranged husband's laptop, some of which were marked "classified," sparked Trump's outrage. He also mentioned former FBI Director James Comey's involvement in the Clinton email investigation, suggesting he should face consequences as well. Trump believes Abedin's actions compromised national security and warrants jail time.
END OF SUMMARY.
