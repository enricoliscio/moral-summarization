SUMMARY: President Trump criticized Huma Abedin, aide to Hillary Clinton, for potential security breaches in handling classified information, calling for the "Deep State" DOJ to act. He drew comparisons to the case of Kristian Saucier, a sailor imprisoned for taking photos in a nuclear submarine, suggesting a double standard. The State Department recently released emails from Abedin's account, found on her husband Anthony Weiner's laptop, some marked as classified. Abedin also forwarded sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. James Comey, former FBI Director, had testified that Abedin forwarded emails to Weiner for printing for Clinton. Comey called Clinton's handling of classified information "extremely careless." Trump's tweet highlights ongoing concerns about potential double standards and the handling of sensitive information by government officials.
