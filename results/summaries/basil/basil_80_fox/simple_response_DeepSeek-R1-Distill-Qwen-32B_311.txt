Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Trump criticizing Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton, for mishandling classified information. He's calling on the Justice Department to take action, comparing her to a sailor who was jailed for taking unauthorized photos. Trump seems to suggest there's a double standard because the sailor was punished but Abedin wasn't. 

The article mentions that the State Department released some emails from Abedin's account, which were found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner's laptop. Some of these emails were classified. She also forwarded sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. She even sent passwords for her government laptop to Yahoo. 

There's also mention of the 2016 election where the discovery of these emails by the FBI, led by Comey, affected the race. Comey had previously said Clinton was "extremely careless" with classified emails on her private server.

So, the moral framing here is about accountability and fairness. Trump is highlighting that while a low-ranking sailor faced jail time, high-level officials like Abedin didn't, suggesting a lack of justice. The article also ties into the broader context of the 2016 election and the handling of classified information by Clinton's team.

I need to make sure the summary captures this moral angle, emphasizing Trump's criticism of the double standard and the security lapses by Abedin and Clinton. I should keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

SUMMARY: President Trump criticized Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, for allegedly mishandling classified information, calling on the Justice Department to act. He highlighted a perceived double standard, comparing her to a sailor jailed for unauthorized photos, while Abedin faced no punishment. The State Department released emails from Abedin's account, found on her estranged husband's laptop, including classified materials. Abedin forwarded sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked, and sent government laptop passwords to Yahoo. Trump's tweet came after the FBI's discovery of Clinton's emails on Weiner's laptop during the 2016 election, which reignited the case against Clinton. Comey previously described Clinton as "extremely careless" with classified emails. Trump's comments emphasize accountability and fairness, suggesting a lack of justice in how high-level officials are treated compared to lower-ranking personnel. END OF SUMMARY.
