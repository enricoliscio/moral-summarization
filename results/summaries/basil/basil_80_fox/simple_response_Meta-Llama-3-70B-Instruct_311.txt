SUMMARY:

President Trump has called for the "Deep State" Justice Department to take action against Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, over potential security issues in her handling of classified material. Trump tweeted that Abedin had disregarded basic security protocols, putting classified passwords in the hands of foreign agents, and suggested that she should be jailed. He drew a comparison with the case of U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos inside a nuclear submarine. Trump's tweet comes after the release of a batch of emails from Abedin's account, which included at least four classified documents and showed that she had forwarded sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. The President's criticism implies that Abedin and Clinton have been given preferential treatment compared to others who have mishandled classified information.
