SUMMARY: President Trump criticized Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, for her handling of classified material, calling on the Justice Department to take action. Trump accused Abedin of disregarding security protocols and putting classified passwords at risk by forwarding sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was hacked in 2013. He compared her actions to those of Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was imprisoned for taking photos inside a nuclear submarine, suggesting a double standard. The criticism comes after the State Department released a batch of Abedin's emails, including classified documents, from her estranged husband's laptop. Former FBI Director James Comey had previously stated that Abedin forwarded emails to be printed for Clinton, calling Clinton's handling of emails "extremely careless." Trump's tweet highlights ongoing concerns about the handling of classified information and potential double standards in punishment.
