SUMMARY:

President Trump has called out Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, for allegedly disregarding security protocols and putting classified information at risk. Trump tweeted that Abedin should be jailed for her actions, citing the case of a U.S. Navy sailor who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos on a submarine. The president's tweet comes after the release of a batch of emails from Abedin's account, which included at least four classified documents. Abedin had forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. Trump is accusing the "Deep State" Justice Department of failing to act on Abedin's security breaches, while also referencing former FBI Director James Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation. The president is suggesting a double standard, where Clinton and her aides have not been held accountable for their actions.

END OF SUMMARY.
