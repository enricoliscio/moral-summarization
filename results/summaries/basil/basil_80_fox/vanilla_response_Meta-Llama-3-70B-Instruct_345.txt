SUMMARY:

President Trump has called for the "Deep State" Justice Department to take action against Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, over potential security issues in her handling of classified material. Trump tweeted that Abedin had "disregarded basic security protocols" and put classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents. He compared Abedin's actions to those of U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos on a submarine. The president's tweet comes after the release of a batch of emails from Abedin's account, including at least four marked "classified," which were discovered by the FBI on her estranged husband's laptop. Abedin had also forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo email account, which was later hacked. Trump is suggesting a double standard, as Abedin has not faced punishment for her actions.
