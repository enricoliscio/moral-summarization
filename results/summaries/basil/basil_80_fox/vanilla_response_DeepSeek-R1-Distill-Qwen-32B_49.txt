Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about President Trump criticizing Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton, over security issues with classified materials. He tweets about her putting classified passwords into foreign agents' hands and compares it to a sailor who went to jail for taking submarine photos. Trump is calling on the Justice Department, referring to it as the "Deep State," to act.

The article mentions that the State Department released emails from Abedin's account found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner's laptop. Some of these emails were classified. She forwarded sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. She also sent her government laptop's password to her Yahoo account, and Yahoo was hacked in 2013, affecting all accounts.

James Comey, the former FBI Director, mentioned that Abedin sent emails to Weiner to print for Clinton. These emails were found during the investigation into Weiner's sexting case, which reopened the case against Clinton. Comey said Clinton was careless with classified emails on her private server.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's criticism, the security issues, the email dump, the classified emails, the hacking incident, and Comey's statements. I'll make sure to include the comparison Trump made and the impact on the 2016 election.

Let me structure it: Trump criticizes Abedin, points out security lapses, mentions the email dump and classified materials, her forwarding emails to Yahoo, the hacking, Comey's role, and the reopening of the Clinton case. I'll keep each point concise to stay within the word limit.

I think that covers all the key points. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.
