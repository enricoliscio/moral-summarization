SUMMARY:
President Trump slammed "Crooked" Hillary Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin, accusing her of "disregarding basic security protocols" and putting classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Trump called on the "Deep State" Justice Department to act, suggesting a "double standard" is at play compared to the punishment of U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was jailed for taking unauthorized photos inside a nuclear submarine. The president's tweet comes after a recent email dump revealed that Abedin forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo email account, which was later hacked. Trump implied that Abedin's actions were "extremely careless" and deserving of punishment, unlike Clinton and her aides who were not held accountable. END OF SUMMARY.
