SUMMARY:
President Trump slammed "Crooked" Hillary Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin, accusing her of "disregarding basic security protocols" and putting classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Trump called on the "Deep State" Justice Department to act, suggesting a "double standard" is at play compared to the punishment of U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was jailed for taking unauthorized photos inside a nuclear submarine. The president's tweet comes after a recent email dump revealed at least four classified documents on Abedin's account, which she forwarded to her personal Yahoo email account before it was hacked. Trump's criticism echoes former FBI Director James Comey's assessment that Clinton was "extremely careless" in her handling of classified emails on her private server. Trump demanded action from the Justice Department, saying it's time to hold Abedin and others, including Comey, accountable. END OF SUMMARY.
