SUMMARY:
President Trump slammed Crooked Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin, calling for the "Deep State" Justice Department to act on potential security breaches. Abedin, accused of disregarding security protocols, handled Classified information recklessly, even putting passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Trump drew a contrast with the case of a Navy Sailor jailed for taking sailors' pictures on a submarine, suggesting a double standard. The issue arose after the State Department released Abedin's emails, found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner's laptop, which included classified material and sensitive information forwarded to her personal Yahoo account, hacked in 2013. James Comey, the former FBI Director, had previously described Clinton's handling of emails as "extremely careless." Abedin's emails, connected to Weiner's sexting case, reopened the investigation days before the 2016 election. END OF SUMMARY.
