Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Trump criticizing Huma Abedin. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning Trump's tweet about Huma Abedin, calling her "Crooked" and suggesting she mishandled classified material. He compares this to the sailor who was jailed for taking photos in a submarine, implying a double standard.

Next, the article explains that the State Department released some emails from Abedin's account found on her estranged husband's laptop. Some were classified, and she forwarded sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. She also sent passwords for her government laptop to Yahoo, which was a security risk.

Then, it mentions James Comey's role in the Clinton email investigation. He testified that Abedin forwarded emails to Weiner so Clinton could review them. This discovery by the FBI affected the 2016 election, reopening the case against Clinton after it had been closed.

So, the main points are:
1. Trump criticizes Huma Abedin for mishandling classified info.
2. Emails were found on her husband's laptop, some classified.
3. She forwarded sensitive emails to her personal account, which was hacked.
4. Comey's testimony about her actions during the Clinton investigation.
5. The comparison to the sailor's case to highlight a double standard.

I need to condense these points into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's criticism, mention the emails and security issues, reference Comey's testimony, and note the comparison to the sailor case. I should keep it concise and include all key elements without going into too much detail.

Let me structure it: Trump tweets about Abedin, the emails and security issues, mention the hacking and passwords, reference Comey's testimony, and the comparison to the sailor. That should cover all necessary points succinctly.
