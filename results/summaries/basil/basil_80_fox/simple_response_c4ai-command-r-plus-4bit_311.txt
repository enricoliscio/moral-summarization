SUMMARY: President Trump slammed Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, for her handling of classified material, calling on the 'Deep State' Justice Department to act. Trump accused Abedin of disregarding security protocols and putting classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents, drawing a comparison to the case of a U.S. Navy Sailor who was jailed for taking photos inside a nuclear submarine. The president's outrage comes after the State Department released a batch of Abedin's emails, which revealed potential security risks, including the forwarding of sensitive information to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. Former FBI Director James Comey had previously criticized Clinton for being 'extremely careless' with classified emails. Trump's tweet highlights a perceived double standard in the justice system, calling for action not only against Abedin but also against Comey and others involved in the Clinton email scandal. Trump's use of the term 'Deep State' implies a hidden agenda within the government, suggesting a biased and unfair application of justice.
END OF SUMMARY.
