Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Trump criticizing Huma Abedin and the Justice Department. I need to focus on the words the author used, like "issues," "dump," "accused," etc. 

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. Trump is slamming Huma Abedin, calling her "crooked," and mentions the "Deep State" DOJ. He's pointing out security issues with classified material. The article talks about emails being dumped, classified passwords, and hacking. 

I should make sure to include terms like "accused," "disregarding," "prison," and "punishment." Also, mention the comparison to the sailor who was jailed. I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and use the morally charged words as much as possible.

I'll start by stating Trump's action, then detail the accusations against Abedin, including the email dump, classified materials, and hacking. Then, mention Trump's call to the DOJ and the comparison to the sailor. Finally, note the implications for the 2016 election and the criticism of Clinton's handling.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too wordy. Also, make sure to end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: President Trump has criticized Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, for allegedly disregarding security protocols by handling classified material. He called on the "Deep State" Justice Department to act, referencing a recent email dump that revealed Abedin had forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. Trump compared this to the case of a U.S. Navy sailor who was jailed for taking unauthorized photos inside a nuclear submarine, suggesting a double standard in punishment. The emails, discovered by the FBI on a laptop belonging to Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, included classified documents. Former FBI Director James Comey previously described Clinton as "extremely careless" in her handling of classified emails. Trump's tweet highlights the security issues and calls for accountability, while also bringing up the investigation into Clinton's email case, which was reopened in 2016. The situation has raised questions about the handling of classified information and the potential consequences for those involved. END OF SUMMARY.
