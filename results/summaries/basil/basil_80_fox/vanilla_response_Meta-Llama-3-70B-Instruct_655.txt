SUMMARY:

President Trump criticized Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, on Twitter, accusing her of disregarding basic security protocols and putting classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents. He called on the "Deep State" Justice Department to take action, citing the case of a U.S. Navy sailor who was imprisoned for taking unauthorized photos on a submarine. Trump's tweet comes after the State Department released a batch of emails from Abedin's account, including at least four marked "classified." Abedin had forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo email account, which was later hacked. Trump implied that there is a double standard at play, as Abedin and Clinton have not faced punishment for their handling of classified material. Former FBI Director James Comey had previously stated that Abedin forwarded emails to her husband, Anthony Weiner, to print out for Clinton.
