Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about President Trump criticizing Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton, over security issues with classified materials. Trump tweeted about her handling classified passwords and compared it to a sailor who was jailed for taking submarine photos. He's calling on the Justice Department to act, referring to it as the "Deep State."

The article mentions that the State Department released some emails from Abedin's account found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner's laptop. Four of these were classified. She forwarded sensitive emails to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. She also sent her government laptop's password to Yahoo, which was part of a major hack in 2013.

James Comey, the former FBI Director, testified that Abedin forwarded emails to Weiner so he could print them for Clinton. These emails were found during the investigation into Weiner's sexting case, which affected the 2016 election as Comey's revelation came just before the election.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's tweet, the comparison to the sailor, the release of emails, the classified nature, the hacking incident, and the impact on the election. I'll make sure to include key points like the security breaches, the hacking of Yahoo, and the influence on the election.

Let me structure it: Trump criticizes Abedin, mentions the emails and classified info, compares to the sailor, points out the security lapses, the hacking, and the impact on the election. I'll keep it concise, making sure each sentence covers a main point without going into too much detail.

I think that's a solid summary. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200.
