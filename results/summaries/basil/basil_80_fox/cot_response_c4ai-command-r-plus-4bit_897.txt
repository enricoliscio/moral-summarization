SUMMARY: 
President Trump slammed 'Crooked' Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, calling for the 'Deep State' Justice Department to take action over potential security breaches. Trump accused Abedin of disregarding security protocols and mishandling classified material, including passwords. This comes after the release of Abedin's emails from her personal Yahoo account, which was hacked in 2013. Abedin also forwarded sensitive emails to her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, and put classified information at risk. Trump drew a comparison to the case of Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was jailed for taking unauthorized photos, suggesting a double standard in the justice system. The president's criticism highlights the 'extremely careless' handling of classified information by Clinton and her aides, with potential implications for national security. The discovery of Abedin's emails on Weiner's laptop during a sexting investigation had previously shaken the 2016 presidential race.
