SUMMARY:
President Trump slammed Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, calling for the "Deep State" Justice Department to act on potential security breaches. Trump accused Abedin of "disregarding" security protocols, putting "Classified" passwords in the hands of "foreign" agents. He highlighted the case of a sailor jailed for taking "unauthorized" photos in a submarine, suggesting a double standard. Abedin's emails, discovered on her husband's laptop, revealed sensitive State Department information and passwords, forwarded to her personal Yahoo account, which was later hacked. James Comey, the former FBI director, testified that Abedin forwarded emails to her husband for printing, an "extremely careless" handling of "classified" information. The discovery of these emails shook the 2016 election, reopening the case against Clinton. Trump's tweet demands justice for Abedin, Comey, and others involved in this security breach. 

END OF SUMMARY.
