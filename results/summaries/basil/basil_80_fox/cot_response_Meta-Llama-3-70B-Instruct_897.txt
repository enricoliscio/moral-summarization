SUMMARY:
President Trump slammed "Crooked" Hillary Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin, accusing her of "disregarding basic security protocols" and putting classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Trump called on the "Deep State" Justice Department to act, suggesting a "double standard" is at play compared to the punishment of U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was jailed for taking unauthorized photos inside a nuclear submarine. The president's tweet comes after the release of a batch of emails from Abedin's account, which included at least four classified documents. Abedin also forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo email account, which was later hacked. Trump's criticism echoes former FBI Director James Comey's assessment that Clinton was "extremely careless" in her handling of classified emails on her private server. END OF SUMMARY.
