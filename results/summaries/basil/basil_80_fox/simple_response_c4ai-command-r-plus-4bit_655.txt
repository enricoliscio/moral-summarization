SUMMARY: President Trump calls for justice and accountability as he exposes the double standards and potential security breaches committed by Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin. In a recent tweet, Trump highlights Abedin's disregard for basic security protocols, endangering national security by handing classified passwords to foreign agents. This contrasts with the punishment given to U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was jailed for taking photos inside a nuclear submarine. The State Department's release of Abedin's emails, including classified information and sensitive passwords, reveals a shocking breach. Former FBI Director James Comey's investigation and testimony during the 2016 presidential race highlighted Clinton's "extremely careless" handling of classified emails, yet no charges were filed. Trump's tweet demands action from a "Deep State" Justice Department, urging them to address this injustice and hold those responsible, including Comey, accountable for their actions. Trump's stance sends a clear message against impunity and selective justice, calling for equal treatment under the law, regardless of power or political affiliation.
END OF SUMMARY.
