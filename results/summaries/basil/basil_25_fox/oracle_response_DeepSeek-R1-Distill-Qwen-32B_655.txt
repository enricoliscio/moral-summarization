Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Paul Ryan and the Medicare debate, preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Ryan is defending his Medicare plan, contrasting it with Obama's. He uses words like "save," "protect," and "strengthen" to describe his plan. He accuses Obama of "raiding" Medicare to finance ObamaCare. The article mentions that both sides are selective in their descriptions, and there's a lot of back-and-forth about who's cutting what and how it affects seniors.

I should start the summary by highlighting Ryan's defense of his plan, using those moral terms. Then, mention his accusation against Obama, again using the moral language. I need to include the points about the Romney-Ryan ad, their claims of preserving Medicare, and Obama's response about the cuts and the voucher system.

I should also note the debate over whether the cuts are to benefits or just to payments to providers, and how both sides are framing the issue. Finally, I'll mention the broader economic and political context, like the failure to create jobs and the debt crisis.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I have to be concise but include as many of the moral terms as possible. I'll structure it in a few sentences, each covering a key point with the appropriate framing words.

SUMMARY: Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan, claiming it "saves," "protects," and "strengthens" the program, while accusing President Obama of "raiding" Medicare to "finance" ObamaCare. Ryan argued that his plan "continues" the "guarantee" of Medicare for current seniors, unlike Obama’s plan, which he claims "damages" Medicare. The Romney-Ryan campaign released an ad alleging Obama "cut" $716 billion from Medicare to "pay" for his health care law, while Ryan’s plan aims to "restore" these "cuts" and "prevent" further raids. However, the Obama campaign dismissed Ryan’s claims as "dishonest" and "hypocritical," asserting that Ryan’s own budget would "end" Medicare as we know it by replacing it with vouchers. The debate centers on whether the cuts reduce benefits or merely lower payments to providers, with both sides presenting "clear contrasts" in their approaches. Ryan emphasized his plan’s goal to "create" jobs and "save" the country from a "debt crisis," while Obama criticized Ryan’s tax plan as "wrong" and "hurtful" to the economy. The moral framing highlights the clash over "failure," "dragging" growth, and the "crisis" of Medicare’s future. END OF SUMMARY.
