Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Paul Ryan's response to criticism regarding his Medicare plan. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, ending with specific tokens. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Ryan is countering Obama's claims by saying his plan preserves Medicare, while Obama's uses it as a "piggy bank." He emphasizes that his plan doesn't cut benefits for current seniors but changes it for future retirees. The article also mentions the Obama campaign's counterarguments, accusing Ryan of misleading and pointing out that his own budget would end Medicare as we know it by replacing it with vouchers. There's a debate over who's cutting Medicare more and how the savings are achieved. Additionally, Ryan talks about his bond with Romney and his economic philosophy influenced by Ayn Rand.

I need to condense all this into a coherent summary. I'll start by stating Ryan's defense of the Romney-Ryan plan, contrasting it with Obama's. Then mention the key points: no changes for current seniors, changes for future, the accusation of using Medicare to fund ObamaCare, and the counter that Ryan's plan would end Medicare. Also, include the economic debate and the personal aspects like Ryan's background and Romney's selection of him.

I should ensure the summary is clear and within the word limit. I'll avoid jargon and keep it straightforward, focusing on the main arguments and counterarguments without getting too detailed. Make sure to include both sides' perspectives to present a balanced view.
