SUMMARY:
Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan, claiming that President Obama's healthcare plan treats Medicare like a "piggy bank" to fund ObamaCare, while the Romney-Ryan plan preserves and strengthens it. Ryan argued that Obama's plan is "damaging" Medicare for current seniors, whereas their plan protects it. The Obama campaign disputed this, calling the Romney-Ryan ad "dishonest and hypocritical" and claiming that their plan would "end Medicare as we know it." Ryan also criticized Obama's economic policies, labeling them an "utter failure" and accusing him of "blame and attack" tactics. The Romney campaign is trying to show a "clear contrast" between their plan and Obama's, which they claim is "wrong." END OF SUMMARY.
