SUMMARY:

Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan, claiming it would "save" and "protect" the entitlement, while President Obama's healthcare plan is "raiding" it to "finance" ObamaCare. Ryan stated that Obama's plan is "damaging" Medicare for current seniors, and his own plan would "strengthen" it. The Romney campaign released a TV ad accusing Obama of "cutting" $716 billion from Medicare to "pay" for ObamaCare. Ryan argued that his plan would "restore" those cuts and "prevent" the "raid" on Medicare. The Obama campaign countered that Ryan's plan would "end" Medicare as we know it, leaving seniors with only a voucher. Ryan also criticized Obama's economic policies, calling them a "failure" that is "dragging" down economic growth. The Romney campaign emphasized the "clear contrast" between their plan and Obama's, which they claim would "hurt" the economy.
