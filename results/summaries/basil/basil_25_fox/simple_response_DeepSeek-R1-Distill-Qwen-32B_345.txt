Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Paul Ryan's defense of the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Ryan is countering Obama's criticism, saying that Obama's plan treats Medicare as a piggy bank. He claims their plan preserves Medicare, while Obama's uses it to fund Obamacare. 

The article mentions that Democrats are accusing Ryan of ending Medicare as we know it. The Obama campaign released a video highlighting Ryan's budget changes. Ryan's ad argues that Obama cut $716 billion from Medicare to pay for his plan. 

Ryan's plan changes Medicare for future retirees but keeps current benefits. He emphasizes the contrast between their approach and Obama's. The Obama campaign disputes this, calling the ad dishonest and pointing out that Ryan's own budget would end Medicare with vouchers. 

Both sides are selective in their descriptions. Ryan's plan would give government payments for private plans, which he says preserves Medicare. However, the CBO says it slows benefit growth. The article also touches on job creation and Romney-Ryan's chemistry. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main arguments: Ryan's defense, the contrast with Obama's plan, the criticism from Democrats, and the selective framing by both sides. I should include the key points without getting too detailed.

Now, I'll structure the summary, making sure to highlight the moral framing each side uses. Ryan presents their plan as saving Medicare, while Obama's campaign accuses them of ending it. I'll also mention the ad and the counterarguments. 

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Let me put it all together concisely, ensuring the moral aspects are preserved as per the original text.
