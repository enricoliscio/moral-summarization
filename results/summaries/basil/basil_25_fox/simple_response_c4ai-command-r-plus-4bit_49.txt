SUMMARY: Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney are defending their Medicare plan against criticism from President Obama and Democrats, who charge that Ryan's budget proposals would "end Medicare as we know it." Ryan argues that their plan preserves Medicare and protects current retirees and those nearing retirement, while Obama's health care law treats it as a "piggy bank" to finance ObamaCare. He claims the Romney-Ryan plan offers a clear contrast and will strengthen Medicare, ensuring its guarantee for future generations. The Obama campaign disputes this, stating that the Romney-Ryan budget would replace guaranteed benefits with vouchers, damaging Medicare for current seniors. Both sides selectively frame the debate, with Ryan emphasizing choice and savings, while Obama's campaign focuses on cuts to provider payments. Ryan also criticizes Obama's economic policies and job creation efforts, citing heavy borrowing as a drag on growth. Ryan's admiration for Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged" is noted, along with Obama's critique of the Ryan-Romney tax plan.
