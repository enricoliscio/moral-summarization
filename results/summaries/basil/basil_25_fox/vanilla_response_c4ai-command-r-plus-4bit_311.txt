SUMMARY: Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan in an interview with Fox News, claiming that the Romney-Ryan plan preserves Medicare while President Obama's healthcare plan treats it like a "piggy bank." Ryan argued that their plan saves and protects Medicare for current and near retirees, while Obama's plan cuts $716 billion from Medicare to fund his healthcare law. The Obama campaign disputed Ryan's claims, stating that Ryan's own proposals would end Medicare as we know it and replace guaranteed benefits with vouchers. Both sides are selective in describing each other's plans, with Ryan's proposal including significant changes to Medicare a decade from now. Ryan also criticized Obama's economic policies and discussed his bond with Romney during the interview. Obama, meanwhile, criticized Ryan's and Romney's tax plan during a stop in Iowa, calling their views "wrong."
END OF SUMMARY.
