Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Paul Ryan responding to criticism about his Medicare plan, and the debate between the Romney-Ryan campaign and Obama's campaign.

First, I should identify the main points. Ryan is arguing that Obama's plan is raiding Medicare to fund Obamacare, while their plan preserves it. He claims their approach saves Medicare for current seniors. The Obama campaign counters by saying Ryan's plan would end Medicare as we know it, replacing it with vouchers.

I need to capture the moral arguments from both sides. Ryan's side is about protecting Medicare and not raiding it, while Obama's side accuses Ryan of ending Medicare. I should also mention the selective descriptions and the underlying debate about the future of Medicare.

I'll start by stating Ryan's position, then Obama's response, and note that both sides are highlighting their own values. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and neutral but includes the moral framing.

Let me structure it: introduce Ryan's stance, the contrast he draws, Obama's counter, and the ongoing debate. Make sure to include key phrases like "piggy bank," "raid," and "voucher" to reflect the moral framing.

I need to ensure the summary is balanced, presenting both perspectives without bias. Also, mention that both campaigns are selective in their descriptions to highlight the conflict.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check for clarity and that all essential points are covered without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan during an interview with Fox News, arguing that President Obama’s healthcare law treats Medicare as a “piggy bank” to fund Obamacare, while the Romney-Ryan plan preserves it. Ryan emphasized that their approach strengthens Medicare for current and near-retirees, unlike Obama’s plan, which he claims is damaging Medicare. The Obama campaign has accused Ryan of “ending Medicare as we know it,” a charge Ryan denies, stating his plan aims to save Medicare by preventing cuts to benefits. The Romney campaign released an ad claiming Obama cut $716 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while the Obama campaign disputes this, arguing Ryan’s plan would replace Medicare with vouchers. Both sides are presenting selective arguments, with Ryan’s proposal offering government payments for private plans starting a decade from now, while Obama’s plan reduces payments to providers. The debate highlights contrasting visions for Medicare’s future, with Romney-Ryan framing their plan as protective and Obama’s campaign accusing them of undermining the program. END OF SUMMARY.
