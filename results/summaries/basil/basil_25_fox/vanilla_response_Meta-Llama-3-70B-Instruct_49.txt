SUMMARY:

Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, defended their Medicare plan in an interview with Fox News, claiming that President Obama's healthcare plan treats Medicare like a "piggy bank" to fund ObamaCare. Ryan argued that their plan preserves Medicare, while Obama's plan damages it for current seniors. The Romney campaign released a new TV ad, which states that Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare to pay for ObamaCare. The Obama campaign disputed this, saying that the cuts do not affect guaranteed Medicare benefits and that the Romney-Ryan plan would end Medicare as we know it. Ryan also criticized Obama's job creation record and borrowing policies. The Romney campaign is trying to show a clear contrast between their Medicare plan and Obama's, while the Obama campaign is accusing Ryan of hypocrisy given his own proposals for Medicare.
