Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Paul Ryan and his Medicare plan. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, the article talks about Paul Ryan responding to criticism over his Medicare plan. He's using Fox News and a TV ad to argue against Obama's plan, saying it treats Medicare like a piggy bank. Ryan claims that the Romney-Ryan plan preserves Medicare, unlike Obama's which he says raids it for funding. He emphasizes that their plan doesn't change benefits for current retirees, which is a contrast to Obama's plan.

The Obama campaign is countering this, calling Ryan's ad dishonest because Ryan's own budget proposals would change Medicare significantly. They argue that Obama's plan actually extends Medicare's life by cutting waste and fraud, not benefits. The article also mentions that both sides are selective in their descriptions of each other's plans.

Ryan's plan would change Medicare for future retirees by giving them government payments to buy private plans. He says this preserves Medicare, but critics say it ends Medicare as we know it. The article notes that Ryan's plan would slow benefit growth, according to the CBO, even though he doesn't call it cuts. The ObamaCare cuts he refers to are lower payments to providers, which Ryan argues would affect patients.

Additionally, Ryan and Romney's relationship is discussed, with Ryan sharing how they bonded over shared policy views. Ryan also mentions his interest in Ayn Rand's novels, which sparked his interest in economics, though he doesn't fully share her philosophy.

The summary needs to capture the main points: Ryan's defense of his Medicare plan, the contrast with Obama's plan, the campaigns' counterarguments, and the implications of each plan. It should also mention the political dynamics between the two campaigns and Ryan's background.

I should structure the summary to first introduce Ryan's response, then outline the key points of each campaign's arguments, mention the specifics of Ryan's plan, the counterarguments, and perhaps touch on the political implications and Ryan's background briefly.

Let me make sure I stay within 200 words and include all essential elements without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan, arguing it preserves the program while President Obama's plan "raids" it to fund Obamacare. Ryan, Romney's running mate, claims their plan protects Medicare for current seniors, while Obama's cuts $716 billion from it. The Obama campaign disputes this, calling Ryan's claims dishonest, as his budget proposals would significantly alter Medicare. Ryan's plan would give future retirees government payments for private plans, which he says preserves Medicare, though critics argue it ends the program as we know it. Both sides highlight contrasts in their approaches, with Obama's plan cutting waste and fraud to extend Medicare's life, while Ryan's slows benefit growth. Ryan and Romney emphasize their shared policy views, and Ryan acknowledges Romney's confidence in his experience to help the country recover. END OF SUMMARY.
