SUMMARY: Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan in an interview with Fox News and a new TV ad, claiming that President Obama's health care plan uses it as a "piggy bank" while the "Romney-Ryan" plan preserves it. Ryan argued that their plan offers a clear contrast, protecting Medicare for current and near retirees, while Obama's plan damages it. The Obama campaign disputed this, stating that Ryan's own proposals would end Medicare as we know it by replacing guaranteed benefits with vouchers. Both sides are being selective in their descriptions, with Ryan proposing changes for future retirees and criticizing ObamaCare's cuts to provider payments. Ryan also criticized Obama's economic policies and discussed his bond with Romney, stating they share values and a mutual understanding. Obama, meanwhile, criticized Ryan's tax plan, stating that their views are wrong for the country.
END OF SUMMARY.
