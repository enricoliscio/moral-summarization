SUMMARY: Paul Ryan went on the offensive in an interview with Fox News and a new TV ad, claiming that President Obama's health care plan treats Medicare like a "piggy bank" while the "Romney-Ryan" plan aims to save, protect, and strengthen it. Ryan argued that their plan offers a clear contrast by not raiding Medicare to pay for ObamaCare and continuing the guarantee of Medicare for current and near-future retirees. He accused Obama of damaging Medicare for current seniors and turning it into a piggy bank to finance ObamaCare. The Romney-Ryan ticket aims to restore cuts and prevent the raid on Medicare funds. However, the Obama campaign has disputed these claims, calling the Romney-Ryan ad dishonest and hypocritical. They argue that their savings do not cut guaranteed Medicare benefits and that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it. Both sides are selectively framing each other's plans, with Ryan proposing future changes to Medicare while criticizing ObamaCare's cuts to provider payments. Ryan also criticized Obama's job creation record and blamed his borrowing for dragging down economic growth. Obama, meanwhile, criticized Ryan's tax plan during a stop in Iowa, stating that the Romney-Ryan views are wrong.
END OF SUMMARY.
