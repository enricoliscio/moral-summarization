Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Paul Ryan is responding to criticism about his Medicare plan, contrasting it with Obama's. He's using terms like "raid," "piggy bank," and "end Medicare as we know it." These are strong moral words that frame the debate.

Next, I'll identify all the morally charged words as per the user's instructions. Words like "raid," "piggy bank," "end," "damage," "dishonest," "hypocritical," "failure," "dragging," "blame," "attack," "wrong," and "failure" stand out. These words are used to create a negative image of the opposing side.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article, keeping these moral terms. The key points are Ryan's defense of his plan, Obama's criticism, the contrasting claims about Medicare, and the political dynamics between the two campaigns. I'll structure the summary to highlight the moral framing, showing how each side accuses the other of harming Medicare.

I should ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the identified moral terms. I'll start by stating Ryan's response, then outline the opposing arguments, and conclude with the broader implications of the debate. This approach maintains the moral perspective each side is presenting.

**SUMMARY:**  
Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan, accusing President Obama of treating Medicare as a "piggy bank" to fund ObamaCare, while claiming the Romney-Ryan plan preserves it. Ryan emphasized that their plan saves Medicare for current seniors, contrasting it with Obama's alleged "raid" on Medicare. The Obama campaign countered, calling Ryan's proposals "dishonest" and arguing his plan would end Medicare as we know it, replacing guaranteed benefits with vouchers. Both sides selectively criticized each other's plans, with Ryan's proposal shifting Medicare to private plans in the future, while Obama's cuts aim to reduce waste. Ryan also criticized Obama's job creation record, framing his policies as failures. The debate highlights sharp moral contrasts over Medicare's future, with each side accusing the other of harming seniors' benefits.
