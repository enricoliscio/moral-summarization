SUMMARY: Paul Ryan went on the offensive Tuesday in response to criticism over his Medicare plan, claiming that the Romney-Ryan plan preserves Medicare, while President Obama's healthcare plan treats it like a "piggy bank." Ryan argued that their plan offers to save, protect, and strengthen Medicare, especially for those in or near retirement, while Obama's plan raids Medicare to finance ObamaCare, damaging the program for current seniors. The Romney campaign released an ad highlighting these points and criticizing Obama for cutting Medicare to pay for his healthcare law. Ryan proposes to make changes to Medicare for future retirees while maintaining benefits for current retirees. The Obama campaign disputed these claims, arguing that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it, leaving people with vouchers instead of guaranteed benefits. Both sides are being selective in their descriptions of each other's plans, with Ryan claiming his plan preserves Medicare and achieves savings, while Obama's campaign focuses on the cuts to provider payments. Ryan also criticized Obama for his failure in job creation and his negative campaign tactics. He shared his affection for Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged," which influenced his interest in economics. Obama, meanwhile, criticized Ryan's and Romney's tax plan during a stop in Iowa.
END OF SUMMARY.
