Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Paul Ryan and his Medicare plan. The user has specified that the summary should be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." and should be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The article talks about Ryan responding to criticism about his Medicare plan, comparing it to Obama's healthcare plan. Ryan claims Obama's plan is raiding Medicare to fund Obamacare, while his plan preserves it. He emphasizes that his approach doesn't cut benefits for current retirees. 

The Democrats, particularly the Obama campaign, are accusing Ryan of ending Medicare as we know it, using a web video to highlight Ryan's budget proposals. Ryan's campaign countered with an ad stating that Obama cut $716 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare. 

There's a back-and-forth between the two sides. Ryan's plan would change Medicare for future retirees by giving them government payments for private plans, but he says it's to preserve Medicare. The Obama campaign disputes this, saying Ryan's plan would end Medicare by replacing it with vouchers. 

Ryan also criticized Obama's job creation record and discussed his bond with Romney. He mentioned their shared policy views and how they developed a chemistry during their campaign together. Additionally, Ryan talked about his interest in Ayn Rand's work, though he doesn't fully share her philosophy. 

Obama criticized Ryan's tax plan, calling his views wrong. 

Now, I need to condense all this into a concise summary. I should include the key points: Ryan's defense of his Medicare plan, the contrast with Obama's plan, the ad campaigns, the debate over cuts and vouchers, and the political dynamics between the candidates. I need to make sure it's under 200 words and flows well.

I'll start by stating Ryan's response to criticism, his claims about Obama's plan, and the ad. Then mention the Obama campaign's counter, the specifics of Ryan's plan, the dispute over the impact on Medicare, and the political attacks on each other's records and policies. Finally, include the personal aspects like their bond and Ryan's interest in Ayn Rand. 

I need to ensure each sentence is clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary details. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.
