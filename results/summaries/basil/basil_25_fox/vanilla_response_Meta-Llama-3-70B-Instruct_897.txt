SUMMARY:

Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, has responded to criticism over his Medicare plan, claiming that President Obama's healthcare plan treats Medicare like a "piggy bank" while the "Romney-Ryan" plan preserves it. In an interview with Fox News, Ryan stated that the Obama administration is "raiding" Medicare to pay for Obamacare, and that their plan will strengthen Medicare for current seniors. The Romney campaign has released a new TV ad highlighting the $716 billion cut from Medicare to fund Obamacare. The Obama campaign has disputed this argument, calling the ad "dishonest and hypocritical" and claiming that the Romney-Ryan plan would "end Medicare as we know it". Both sides have been selective in describing each other's plans, with Ryan's proposal aiming to give seniors government payments to purchase private plans or stay within the current system.

END OF SUMMARY.
