SUMMARY:

Paul Ryan, the Republican vice presidential candidate, has launched a counterattack against criticism of his Medicare plan, accusing President Obama of treating the program like a "piggy bank" to fund his healthcare reform. Ryan claims that the Obama administration's plan damages Medicare for current seniors, while his own plan preserves and strengthens it. The Romney campaign has released a TV ad highlighting the $716 billion cut from Medicare to fund ObamaCare. Ryan argues that his plan would restore these cuts and ensure the guarantee of Medicare for current retirees and those nearing retirement. The Obama campaign has disputed these claims, saying that Ryan's plan would "end Medicare as we know it" and leave seniors with only a voucher. The moral framing of the debate pits the Republican promise to "save" and "protect" Medicare against the Democratic accusation of "raiding" and "ending" the program.
