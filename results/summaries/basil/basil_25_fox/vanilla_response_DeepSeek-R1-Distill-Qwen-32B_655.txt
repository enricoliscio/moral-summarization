Okay, I need to summarize this article about Paul Ryan's response to criticism over his Medicare plan. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, Ryan is countering criticism that his Medicare plan would end the program as we know it. He's using an interview with Fox News and a new ad to argue that Obama's healthcare plan treats Medicare like a piggy bank. Ryan claims their plan preserves Medicare, while Obama's uses it to fund his healthcare law.

Ryan emphasizes that his plan doesn't change benefits for current retirees, aiming to save Medicare for future generations. He accuses Obama of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to fund ObamaCare, which he calls a raid on the program.

The Obama campaign is disputing this, saying Ryan's budget would end Medicare by replacing it with vouchers. They argue that their cuts reduce waste, not benefits, and extend Medicare's life by eight years.

Both sides are highlighting different aspects of the other's plan. Ryan's plan would give seniors government payments to buy private plans, which he says preserves Medicare. However, his plan would slow benefit growth, according to the CBO. The article also mentions Ryan's background with Romney, their shared values, and Ryan's interest in Ayn Rand's work.

Obama criticized Ryan's tax plan in Iowa, calling his views wrong. The summary should capture these key points concisely, focusing on the debate over Medicare, the claims from both sides, and the broader campaign context.

I should structure the summary to include Ryan's defense of his plan, the contrast he draws with Obama's, the Obama campaign's counterarguments, and the broader political implications. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll need to be concise but cover all main aspects without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY:  
Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, has defended his Medicare plan, claiming it preserves the program while accusing President Obama's healthcare law of using Medicare as a "piggy bank." Ryan argues that his plan protects benefits for current retirees and strengthens Medicare, while Obama's plan cuts $716 billion from it to fund ObamaCare. The Obama campaign disputes this, stating Ryan's budget would end Medicare as we know it by replacing it with vouchers. Ryan's plan would allow future retirees to use government payments for private plans, while slowing benefit growth over time. Both sides highlight contrasting views on Medicare, with Ryan emphasizing preservation and Obama's campaign accusing him of undermining the program. The debate is central to the election, as Romney and Ryan aim to contrast their approach with Obama's. END OF SUMMARY.
