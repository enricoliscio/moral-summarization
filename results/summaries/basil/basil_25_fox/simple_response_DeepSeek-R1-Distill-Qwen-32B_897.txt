Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Paul Ryan responding to criticism over his Medicare plan. He's contrasting his plan with Obama's, claiming Obama's uses Medicare as a piggy bank. I should highlight the key points: Ryan's defense, the accusations from both sides, the ad claims, and the underlying debate on Medicare's future.

I'll start by noting Ryan's main arguments. He says his plan preserves Medicare, while Obama's undermines it. Then, I'll mention the Obama campaign's counterarguments, calling Ryan's plan dishonest. I should also include the details about the ad and the specific criticisms each side has.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the moral aspects each side is emphasizingâ€”Ryan about not raiding Medicare, Obama about the Romney-Ryan plan ending Medicare as we know it. Also, the mention of job creation and economic policies ties into the broader campaign themes.

I'll structure it to first present Ryan's stance, then the Obama campaign's response, followed by the broader implications of the debate. I'll ensure it's clear and captures the essence without getting too bogged down in details. Finally, I'll wrap it up with the ongoing campaign dynamics and the stakes involved.

SUMMARY: Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan, arguing that it preserves the program while accusing President Obama's healthcare law of treating Medicare as a "piggy bank." Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, claimed their plan strengthens Medicare for current seniors, while Obama's cuts $716 billion from the program to fund Obamacare. Ryan emphasized a "clear contrast" between the Romney-Ryan plan, which leaves benefits for current retirees unchanged, and Obama's approach, which he says damages Medicare for seniors. The Obama campaign countered, calling Ryan's claims "dishonest" and arguing that his budget proposals would end Medicare as we know it, replacing guaranteed benefits with vouchers. Both sides selectively describe each other's plans, with Ryan's proposal shifting Medicare to private plans in the future, while Obama's law reduces payments to providers. The debate highlights competing visions for Medicare's future, with Republicans framing their plan as protective and Democrats accusing them of undermining the program. END OF SUMMARY.
