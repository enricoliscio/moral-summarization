SUMMARY:
Paul Ryan went on the offensive Tuesday in response to criticism over his Medicare plan, claiming in an interview and a new TV ad that Obama’s health care plan treats Medicare like a “piggy bank,” while the “Romney-Ryan” plan aims to preserve and strengthen it. Ryan argued that their plan offers a clear contrast to Obama's, as it protects Medicare for current and near retirees, while Obama's plan raids Medicare to fund ObamaCare. Ryan further asserted that Obama is damaging Medicare for current seniors, a claim he believes is irrefutable and a debate they will win. The Obama campaign, however, disputes this, calling the Romney-Ryan ad dishonest and hypocritical, and accusing Ryan's plan of ending Medicare as we know it. Both sides are selective in their descriptions, but Ryan maintains that his plan preserves Medicare by offering seniors choices, while slamming the Obama overhaul for cutting Medicare and achieving savings through slower benefit growth and reduced payments to providers. Ryan also criticized Obama for his failure to create jobs and blamed his heavy borrowing for dragging down economic growth. The summary also highlights Ryan's bond with Romney, their shared values, and Ryan's affection for novelist Ayn Rand. Obama, meanwhile, criticized Ryan's tax plan, calling their views wrong.
