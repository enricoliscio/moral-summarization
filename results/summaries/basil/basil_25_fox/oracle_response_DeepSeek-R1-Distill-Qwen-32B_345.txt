Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words provided. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the listed morally charged words as possible. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses Paul Ryan's defense of the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan in response to criticism. Ryan claims that Obama's plan treats Medicare as a "piggy bank" and that their plan preserves it. He emphasizes saving, protecting, and strengthening Medicare, while accusing Obama of raiding it to finance ObamaCare. The Obama campaign counters by calling Ryan's plan an end to Medicare as we know it, using terms like dishonest and hypocritical.

I need to make sure the summary includes words like save, protect, strengthen, raiding, continuing, damaging, ending, cut, pay, turned, finance, restore, cuts, prevent, raid, dishonest, hypocritical, eliminating, cutting, fraud, extended, end, left, failure, dragging, getting, back, creating, saving, crisis, hurt.

I should structure the summary to highlight the contrast between the two campaigns, using the moral terms to frame each side's arguments. I'll mention Ryan's claims about preserving Medicare and Obama's accusations of ending it. I'll also include the specific points about cuts, savings, and the impact on seniors.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed. I'll ensure that each morally framed word is appropriately used in context. Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the necessary terms and maintain the moral framing as per the article.

SUMMARY: Paul Ryan defended the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan, claiming it saves, protects, and strengthens Medicare, while accusing Obama’s plan of raiding it to finance ObamaCare. Ryan emphasized continuing Medicare guarantees for current retirees, arguing Obama’s plan damages Medicare by cutting $716 billion. The Obama campaign countered, calling Ryan’s plan an end to Medicare as we know it, with vouchers replacing guaranteed benefits. They labeled Ryan’s claims dishonest and hypocritical, as his budget also achieves Medicare savings. Both sides selectively describe each other’s plans, with Ryan’s proposal slowing benefit growth and Obama’s reducing payments to providers. Ryan also criticized Obama’s failure to create jobs andDragging economic growth. The Romney campaign highlighted their shared values and experience to save the country from debt crisis. Obama accused Ryan’s tax plan of favoring the wealthy, while Ryan defended his policies against socialism’s pitfalls. END OF SUMMARY.
