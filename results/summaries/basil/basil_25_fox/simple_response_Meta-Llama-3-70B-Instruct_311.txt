SUMMARY:

Paul Ryan, the Republican vice presidential nominee, has launched a counterattack against critics of his Medicare plan, accusing President Obama's healthcare law of raiding Medicare to fund ObamaCare. Ryan claims that the Romney-Ryan plan preserves Medicare, while Obama's plan damages it for current seniors. The Romney campaign has released a new TV ad highlighting the $716 billion cut from Medicare to fund ObamaCare. Ryan argues that his plan would leave benefits for current retirees and those retiring soon in place, while making changes for those retiring a decade from now. The Obama campaign disputes this, saying that Ryan's plan would end Medicare as we know it, replacing guaranteed benefits with vouchers. The debate highlights the moral contrast between the two plans, with Ryan framing his plan as a responsible preservation of Medicare and Obama's plan as a reckless raid on the entitlement.
