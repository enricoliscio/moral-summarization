SUMMARY: Paul Ryan went on the offensive in response to criticisms of his Medicare plan, claiming that President Obama's health care plan treats Medicare like a "piggy bank." Ryan argues that the "Romney-Ryan" plan preserves Medicare, while Obama's plan raids it to pay for his health care law. He accuses Obama of damaging Medicare for current seniors and claims that the Romney-Ryan ticket offers a plan to save, protect, and strengthen Medicare. Ryan proposes to make changes to Medicare for future retirees while leaving benefits for current retirees and those retiring soon unchanged. He criticizes the Obama campaign's description of his plan as "ending Medicare as we know it" as dishonest and hypocritical. Ryan acknowledges that his plan achieves savings for Medicare but disputes the characterization of these savings as "cuts." He also attacks Obama's economic record and borrowing practices. Obama, in turn, criticizes Ryan's tax plan, arguing that their views are wrong for the country. Ryan defends his plan, saying it will save Medicare and prevent a debt crisis.
END OF SUMMARY.
