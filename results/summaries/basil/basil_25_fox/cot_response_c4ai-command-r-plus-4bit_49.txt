SUMMARY:
Paul Ryan went on the offensive on Tuesday, defending his Medicare plan in an interview with Fox News and a new TV ad. He claimed that the Romney-Ryan plan preserves Medicare as a treasured entitlement, while President Obama's healthcare plan treats it like a piggy bank, raiding its funds to finance ObamaCare. Ryan argues that their plan offers a clear contrast, protecting current retirees and those near retirement, while Obama's cuts will harm seniors. The Obama campaign disputes this, calling the Romney-Ryan ad dishonest and hypocritical. They argue that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it, replacing guaranteed benefits with vouchers. Ryan counters that his plan achieves savings for Medicare and preserves it for future generations. He also criticized Obama for his failure to create jobs and blamed him for heavy borrowing that drags down economic growth. Ryan shared his affection for Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged," saying it sparked his interest in economics. Obama, meanwhile, criticized Ryan's and Romney's tax plan, calling their views wrong.
END OF SUMMARY.
