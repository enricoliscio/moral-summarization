SUMMARY:
Paul Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, went on the offense against criticism of his Medicare plan, claiming that President Obama's healthcare plan treats Medicare like a "piggy bank" while the "Romney-Ryan" plan preserves it. Ryan argued that Obama's plan "damages" Medicare for current seniors, while his own plan would "save" and "strengthen" the program. The Obama campaign disputed this, calling Ryan's ad "dishonest and hypocritical" and claiming that the Romney-Ryan budget would "end Medicare as we know it." Ryan also criticized Obama's economic policies, calling them an "utter failure" and accusing him of "blame and attack" tactics. The two campaigns are engaged in a heated debate over Medicare and economic policies, with each side accusing the other of being "wrong" and "dishonest." END OF SUMMARY.
