SUMMARY:

Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, defended their Medicare plan in an interview with Fox News, claiming that President Obama's healthcare plan treats Medicare like a "piggy bank" to fund ObamaCare. Ryan argued that their plan preserves Medicare, while Obama's plan damages it for current seniors. The Romney campaign released a new TV ad highlighting the $716 billion cut from Medicare to fund ObamaCare. The Obama campaign disputed the ad, calling it "dishonest and hypocritical" and claiming that the Romney-Ryan plan would "end Medicare as we know it". Ryan also criticized Obama's job creation record and blamed his heavy borrowing for dragging down economic growth. The article also touched on Ryan's bonding with Romney and his admiration for novelist Ayn Rand.
