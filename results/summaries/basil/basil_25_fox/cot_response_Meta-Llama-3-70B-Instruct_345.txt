SUMMARY:
Paul Ryan, the Republican vice presidential candidate, has gone on the offensive against President Obama's healthcare plan, claiming it "raids" Medicare to fund ObamaCare. In an interview with Fox News, Ryan argued that the Romney-Ryan plan "preserves" and "strengthens" Medicare, while Obama's plan "damages" it. Ryan accused Obama of using Medicare as a "piggy bank" to fund his healthcare overhaul. The Obama campaign has disputed this claim, calling it "dishonest" and "hypocritical". Ryan also criticized Obama's economic policies, calling them an "utter failure" and accusing him of running a "blame and attack" campaign. The debate over Medicare and healthcare has become a central issue in the presidential campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
