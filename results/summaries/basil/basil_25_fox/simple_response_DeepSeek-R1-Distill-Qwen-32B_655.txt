Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Paul Ryan's defense of his Medicare plan. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts with Paul Ryan responding to criticism about his Medicare plan. He's using Fox News and a TV ad to argue that Obama's plan treats Medicare as a piggy bank, while Romney-Ryan preserves it. Ryan claims their plan saves Medicare, unlike Obama's which he says raids it for Obamacare. He thinks Medicare is a winning issue for their campaign.

Then, the article mentions that Democrats are charging Ryan with ending Medicare as we know it. The Obama campaign released a web video attacking Ryan's budget proposals. Romney's campaign countered with an ad saying Obama cut $716 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare.

Ryan emphasizes the contrast between their plan and Obama's, saying they don't change benefits for current retirees. He argues Obama's plan cuts Medicare to finance Obamacare. The Obama campaign disputes this, calling the Romney-Ryan ad dishonest. They point out that Ryan's own budget would end Medicare as we know it, replacing it with vouchers.

Both sides are selective in describing each other's plans. Ryan's proposal would change Medicare for future retirees, giving them government payments for private plans. He claims this preserves Medicare, but critics say it ends it. The article also notes that Ryan's plan would slow benefit growth, and Obama's cuts are through lower payments to providers, which Romney's campaign says affects patients.

Ryan also criticizes Obama's job creation and economic policies, and talks about his bond with Romney. He mentions his interest in Ayn Rand's books, though he doesn't fully share her philosophy.

Obama criticizes Ryan's tax plan, calling his views wrong.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, preserving the moral framing. The key points are:

- Ryan defends his Medicare plan, accusing Obama of raiding Medicare for Obamacare.
- Ryan claims their plan saves Medicare, while Obama's harms it.
- Democrats and Obama's campaign counter that Ryan's plan ends Medicare, using vouchers.
- Both sides present selective arguments, with Ryan's plan affecting future retirees and Obama's through provider payments.
- The moral framing includes terms like "piggy bank," "raid," "savings," "cuts," and "vouchers."

I should structure the summary to highlight these points, showing the opposing moral viewpoints. Make sure to include that Ryan's plan is for future retirees, and the Obama campaign's criticism. Also, note that both sides are presenting their cases selectively.

Let me draft the summary, keeping it concise and within the word limit. I'll make sure to capture the moral arguments from both sides without taking a side myself.
