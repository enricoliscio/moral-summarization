SUMMARY: Paul Ryan and the Romney campaign went on the offensive Tuesday, pushing back against Democratic claims that Ryan's Medicare plan would "end Medicare as we know it." In an interview with Fox News, Ryan claimed that it is actually President Obama's health care plan that treats Medicare like a "piggy bank," while the Romney-Ryan plan aims to preserve and strengthen the program. Ryan's proposal includes changes to Medicare for those retiring in the next decade but leaves benefits unchanged for current retirees and those retiring soon. He accused the Obama administration of raiding Medicare to finance ObamaCare and argued that the Romney-Ryan budget would restore those cuts and protect the program. The Obama campaign has disputed this, claiming that Ryan's plan would replace guaranteed benefits with vouchers and that the savings in ObamaCare do not cut Medicare benefits. Ryan countered by saying that his plan would prevent a debt crisis and ensure the sustainability of Medicare for future generations. He also criticized Obama for his handling of the economy and job creation. Ryan's selection as Romney's running mate reflects their shared values and mutual understanding of the issues, with Ryan's expertise in economic policy seen as a complement to Romney's experience.
END OF SUMMARY.
