SUMMARY:

Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan, claiming it will "save", "protect", and "strengthen" the program, while President Obama's healthcare plan is "raiding" it like a "piggy bank" to finance ObamaCare. Ryan argued that Obama's plan is "damaging" Medicare for current seniors, and his own plan will "restore" the cuts and "prevent" the raid. The Obama campaign disputed this, calling Ryan's ad "dishonest" and "hypocritical", and claiming that the Romney-Ryan plan would "end" Medicare as we know it, leaving seniors with only a voucher. Ryan also criticized Obama's economic policies, saying they are "dragging" down economic growth and have led to "utter failure" in creating jobs. The Romney campaign emphasized the "clear contrast" between their plan and Obama's, which they claim will "hurt" the economy.
