SUMMARY: Paul Ryan went on the offensive Tuesday in response to criticism over his Medicare plan. In an interview with Fox News, Ryan claimed that the Romney-Ryan plan preserves Medicare, while President Obama's health care plan treats it like a "piggy bank." Ryan argued that the Obama administration is damaging Medicare for current seniors and raiding it to finance ObamaCare. The Romney campaign released an ad highlighting these points and accusing Obama of cutting $716 billion from Medicare. Ryan proposes changes to Medicare for future retirees while leaving benefits unchanged for current retirees. He slammed the Obama administration for their cuts to Medicare and their wasteful spending. The Obama campaign disputed these claims, calling the Romney-Ryan ad "dishonest and hypocritical." They argued that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it, leaving people with nothing but a voucher. Obama himself criticized Ryan and Romney's tax plan, calling their views "wrong." Ryan, meanwhile, accused Obama of blaming and attacking others instead of taking responsibility for his failures in job creation and economic growth. Ryan also discussed his shared values with Romney and his admiration for novelist Ayn Rand's critique of socialism. END OF SUMMARY.
