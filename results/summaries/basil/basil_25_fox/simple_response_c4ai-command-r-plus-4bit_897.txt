SUMMARY: Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney are standing by their controversial Medicare plan, claiming that it preserves the program for current and soon-to-be retirees, while President Obama's health care plan treats it like a "piggy bank." Ryan, in an interview with Fox News, accused Obama of "raiding" Medicare to fund his health care law and asserted that the "Romney-Ryan" plan offers a clear contrast by saving and strengthening Medicare. He believes Medicare can be a winning issue for their campaign and wants to highlight the differences between their plan and Obama's. The Obama campaign has countered by describing the Romney-Ryan plan as "ending Medicare as we know it," arguing that it would replace guaranteed benefits with vouchers. Ryan defends his plan, saying it preserves Medicare and achieves "savings" without "cuts." Both sides are being selective in their descriptions, with Ryan's plan proposing significant changes to Medicare in the future. Ryan also criticized Obama's economic policies and discussed his bond with Romney, while Obama criticized Ryan's tax plan during a stop in Iowa.
END OF SUMMARY.
