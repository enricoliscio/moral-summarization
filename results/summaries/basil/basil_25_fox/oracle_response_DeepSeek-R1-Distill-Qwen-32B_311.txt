Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about Paul Ryan responding to criticism about his Medicare plan. He's contrasting it with Obama's plan, using terms like "save," "protect," and "strengthen." He accuses Obama of "raiding" Medicare to finance ObamaCare, which is a strong moral statement. The article also mentions the Romney-Ryan ad claiming Obama cut $716 billion from Medicare, which is framed as a negative action.

On the other side, the Obama campaign calls Ryan's plan "dishonest" and "hypocritical," saying it would "end Medicare as we know it" by replacing it with vouchers. They argue that their plan actually "extends" Medicare's life by cutting waste and fraud, using positive terms like "saving" and "protecting."

Both sides are being selective in their descriptions, which introduces a moral judgment on their honesty. Ryan's plan involves giving seniors government payments for private plans, which he frames as preserving Medicare, but opponents say it ends it. The article also touches on job creation and economic policies, with Ryan criticizing Obama's performance.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of the morally charged words as possible without making it too long. I should highlight the contrast between the two campaigns, their accusations, and the moral terms they use. I'll structure it to show both perspectives, using words like "save," "raid," "damage," "end," "cut," "dishonest," and "hypocritical."

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure to include these elements concisely.

SUMMARY:  
Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan, framing it as a way to "save," "protect," and "strengthen" Medicare, while accusing Obama’s plan of "raiding" it to "finance" ObamaCare. Ryan claimed Obama’s plan "damages" Medicare for current seniors, while his plan "continues" the guarantee of benefits for retirees. The Romney-Ryan campaign released an ad alleging Obama "cut" $716 billion from Medicare to "pay" for his health care law. Obama’s campaign countered, calling Ryan’s plan "dishonest" and "hypocritical," arguing it would "end" Medicare as we know it by replacing it with vouchers. The Obama campaign emphasized their plan "extends" Medicare’s life by "eliminating" waste and fraud, while Romney’s plan would "cut" benefits for future retirees. Ryan’s proposal, which would give seniors government payments for private plans, is framed as preserving Medicare, though critics argue it "ends" it. Both sides selectively describe each other’s plans, with Ryan also criticizing Obama’s "failure" to create jobs and dragging down economic growth. The moral framing highlights contrasts in priorities and accusations of "damage," "cuts," and "failure." END OF SUMMARY.
