SUMMARY: Paul Ryan went on the offensive Tuesday in response to criticism over his Medicare plan, arguing that his plan with Mitt Romney is the only one that truly protects and strengthens the treasured entitlement program. Ryan claimed that President Obama's plan treats Medicare like a piggy bank, raiding it to pay for ObamaCare and damaging the program for current seniors. The Romney-Ryan campaign released an ad highlighting these criticisms and drawing a clear contrast between their plan and Obama's. Ryan proposes to make changes to Medicare for future retirees while preserving benefits for current retirees and those near retirement. The Obama campaign has disputed these claims, calling the Romney-Ryan ad dishonest and hypocritical. They argue that Ryan's plan would end Medicare as we know it, leaving people with nothing but a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits. Both sides are being selective in their descriptions of each other's plans. Ryan defended his plan, saying it preserves Medicare and achieves savings without cutting benefits. Obama, meanwhile, criticized Ryan's tax plan and described him as the ideological leader of the Republicans in Congress with views that are wrong.
