SUMMARY: Paul Ryan went on the offensive Tuesday, claiming that the Romney-Ryan plan preserves Medicare while President Obama's health care plan treats it like a "piggy bank." Ryan argued that the Romney-Ryan ticket is offering a plan to save, protect and strengthen Medicare, especially for those in or near retirement. He accused the Obama administration of raiding Medicare to finance ObamaCare, damaging the program for current seniors. The Romney campaign released an ad echoing Ryan's statements, accusing Obama of cutting Medicare to pay for ObamaCare. Ryan wants to make changes to Medicare for future retirees while leaving benefits for current retirees unchanged. The Obama campaign has disputed these claims, calling the Romney-Ryan ad "dishonest and hypocritical." They argue that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it, leaving people with vouchers instead of guaranteed benefits. Both sides are being selective in their descriptions of each other's plans, but Ryan maintains that his proposal would preserve Medicare, not end it. Ryan also criticized Obama's economic policies, calling his job creation efforts a "failure." He emphasized his shared values and mutual understanding with Romney, citing their bond as a reason for joining the ticket. Obama, meanwhile, criticized Ryan's and Romney's tax plan, stating that their views are wrong for the country.
END OF SUMMARY.
