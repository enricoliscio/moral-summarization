SUMMARY:
Paul Ryan, the Republican vice presidential candidate, has gone on the offensive against criticism of his Medicare plan, claiming that President Obama's healthcare plan is "raiding" Medicare, a treasured entitlement, like a "piggy bank" to fund ObamaCare. Ryan argues that the Romney-Ryan plan preserves Medicare, while Obama's plan "damages" it for current seniors. The Obama campaign has disputed this argument, calling the Romney-Ryan ad "dishonest and hypocritical." Ryan has also slammed Obama for his "utter failure" in creating jobs, saying that his heavy borrowing is dragging down economic growth. The debate highlights the clear contrast between the two campaigns' approaches to Medicare and the economy. END OF SUMMARY.
