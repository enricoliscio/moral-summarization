Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed. Let me read through the article again to spot those words.

I see words like "criticism," "raid," "damage," "dishonest," "hypocritical," "failure," "blame," "attack," "wrong." These seem to carry moral connotations, either positive or negative. 

Next, I need to write a concise summary using as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and include the key points: Ryan's defense of his Medicare plan, the contrast with Obama's plan, the accusations from both sides, and the political implications.

I'll start by stating Ryan's response to criticism, highlighting his claims about Obama's plan raiding Medicare. Then, mention the ad and the accusations of dishonesty. Include the details about the plans, the savings vs. cuts, and the political dynamics between the campaigns. Finally, wrap it up with the broader implications of the debate.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the necessary elements without going over the word limit. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is appropriately placed to maintain the original tone.

**SUMMARY:**
Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan against criticism, accusing President Obama's healthcare policy of raiding Medicare to fund ObamaCare, while his plan aims to preserve it. Ryan emphasized that his proposal maintains Medicare benefits for current seniors, contrasting it with Obama's alleged damage to the program. The Romney campaign released an ad claiming Obama cut $716 billion from Medicare, a charge the Obama campaign dismissed as dishonest and hypocritical, pointing to Ryan's own budget proposals. Both sides selectively criticized each other's plans, with Ryan's proposal offering government payments for private plans starting in a decade, while Obama's plan reduces payments to providers. Ryan also criticized Obama's job creation record, framing it as a failure. The article highlights the moral framing of the debate, with accusations of blame, attack, and wrong decisions. END OF SUMMARY.
