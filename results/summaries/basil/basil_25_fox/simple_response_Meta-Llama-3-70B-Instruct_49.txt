SUMMARY:

Paul Ryan, the Republican vice presidential nominee, has launched a counterattack against criticism of his Medicare plan, accusing President Obama of raiding the program to fund his healthcare reform. Ryan claims that the "Romney-Ryan" plan preserves Medicare, while Obama's plan damages it for current seniors. He argues that Obama's healthcare law cuts $716 billion from Medicare to fund other programs, whereas the Romney-Ryan plan would restore those cuts and protect Medicare for those in or near retirement. The Obama campaign disputes this, saying that the savings Ryan attacks do not cut guaranteed Medicare benefits and that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it. The moral framing of the article suggests that Ryan and Romney are fighting to protect Medicare and seniors, while Obama's plan is dishonest and harmful to the program.

END OF SUMMARY.
