SUMMARY:

Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, defended their Medicare plan, claiming it preserves the entitlement, while President Obama's healthcare plan treats it like a "piggy bank". Ryan argued that Obama's plan cuts $716 billion from Medicare to fund ObamaCare, damaging the program for current seniors. In contrast, the Romney-Ryan plan would leave benefits for current retirees and those retiring soon in place, while making changes for those retiring a decade from now. The Obama campaign disputed this, saying the Romney-Ryan plan would "end Medicare as we know it" and leave seniors with vouchers instead of guaranteed benefits. Both sides were accused of being selective in describing each other's plans. Ryan also criticized Obama's job creation record and economic policies.

END OF SUMMARY.
