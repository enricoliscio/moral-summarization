SUMMARY:

Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan, claiming it will "save," "protect," and "strengthen" the program, while President Obama's healthcare plan is "raiding" it to "finance" ObamaCare. Ryan argued that Obama's plan is "damaging" Medicare for current seniors, whereas the "Romney-Ryan" plan will "continue" the guarantee of Medicare for those in or near retirement. The Obama campaign disputed this, calling the Romney-Ryan ad "dishonest" and "hypocritical." Ryan's plan would slow the rate of benefit growth for seniors, which he claims is not a "cut." The Romney campaign retorted that Obama's plan would "end" Medicare as we know it, leaving seniors with only a voucher. Both sides accused each other of being selective in their descriptions. Ryan also criticized Obama's economic policies, saying they are "dragging" down economic growth and "hurting" the economy.
