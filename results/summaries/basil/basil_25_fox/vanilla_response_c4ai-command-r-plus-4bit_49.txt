SUMMARY: In response to criticism of his Medicare plan, Paul Ryan went on the offensive, claiming that President Obama's health care plan uses Medicare as a "piggy bank" while the "Romney-Ryan" plan preserves it. Ryan, in an interview with Fox News, stated that their plan offers to save, protect, and strengthen Medicare, while Obama's plan damages it for current seniors. The Romney campaign released an ad criticizing Obama for cutting $716 billion from Medicare to fund ObamaCare. Ryan proposes to make changes to Medicare for future retirees while leaving benefits for current retirees intact. The Obama campaign disputes this, arguing that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it, leaving people with vouchers instead of guaranteed benefits. Both sides are selective in their descriptions of each other's plans, with Ryan claiming his plan preserves Medicare while achieving "savings" in the long run. Ryan also criticized Obama for his "utter failure" in job creation and heavy borrowing, hindering economic growth. Ryan discussed his bond with Romney, citing their shared values and understanding. Obama, meanwhile, criticized Ryan's and Romney's tax plan during a stop in Iowa, calling their views "wrong."
END OF SUMMARY.
