SUMMARY:

Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan, claiming it will "save", "protect", and "strengthen" the program, while President Obama's healthcare plan is "raiding" it to "finance" ObamaCare. Ryan argued that Obama's plan is "damaging" Medicare for current seniors, and his own plan will "restore" the cuts made by ObamaCare. The Romney campaign released a TV ad stating that Obama has "cut" $716 billion from Medicare to "pay" for ObamaCare. Ryan accused Obama of being "dishonest" and "hypocritical" in his attacks on the Romney-Ryan plan. The Obama campaign disputed the claims, saying that Ryan's plan would "end" Medicare as we know it, leaving seniors with only a voucher. Ryan also criticized Obama's economic policies, calling them a "failure" that is "dragging" down economic growth. He emphasized the need to "get" people back to work and "save" the country from a debt "crisis".
