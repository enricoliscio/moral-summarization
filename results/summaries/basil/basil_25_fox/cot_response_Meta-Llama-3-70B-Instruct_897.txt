SUMMARY:
Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, defended their Medicare plan, claiming it preserves the entitlement, while President Obama's healthcare plan treats it like a "piggy bank." Ryan argued that Obama's plan is "damaging" Medicare for current seniors, and that their plan would "save" and "strengthen" it. The Obama campaign disputed this, calling the Romney-Ryan ad "dishonest" and "hypocritical." Ryan's plan would make changes to Medicare for those retiring a decade from now, but leave benefits for current retirees and those retiring soon in place. Obama's campaign claimed that the Romney-Ryan plan would "end" Medicare as we know it, leaving seniors with nothing but a voucher. Ryan also criticized Obama's economic policies, calling them a "failure" and saying they are based on "blame" and "attack." END OF SUMMARY.
