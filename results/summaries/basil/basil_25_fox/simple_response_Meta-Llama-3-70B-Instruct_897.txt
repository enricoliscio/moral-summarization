SUMMARY:

Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, defended their Medicare plan, claiming it preserves the entitlement program, while President Obama's healthcare plan treats it like a "piggy bank" to fund ObamaCare. Ryan argued that their plan protects Medicare for current seniors, whereas Obama's plan damages it. The Romney campaign released a TV ad highlighting the $716 billion cut from Medicare to fund ObamaCare. Obama's campaign disputed this, saying the cuts don't affect guaranteed benefits and that the Romney-Ryan plan would end Medicare as we know it, replacing it with vouchers. Both sides are being selective in their descriptions, with Ryan's plan slowing benefit growth and Obama's cuts likely coming from lower provider payments. The moral framing of the article suggests that Ryan and Romney are fighting to preserve Medicare, while Obama's plan is damaging it, and that the Romney-Ryan campaign is committed to creating jobs and reducing debt.

END OF SUMMARY.
