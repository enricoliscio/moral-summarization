Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Paul Ryan's response to criticism regarding his Medicare plan. The user wants a concise summary of around 200 words, so I'll have to extract the key points without getting bogged down in details.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main points. Ryan is countering criticism that his plan ends Medicare as we know it. He's using interviews and ads to argue that Obama's plan is raiding Medicare, while his plan preserves it. He emphasizes that their approach saves Medicare for current seniors, unlike Obama's, which he claims cuts $716 billion.

Next, the article mentions the Obama campaign's response, calling Ryan's claims dishonest and pointing out that Ryan's own budget would change Medicare significantly. They argue that Ryan's plan would replace Medicare with vouchers, ending the current system.

I should also note the contrast in approaches: Ryan's plan for future retirees and the current system, versus Obama's focus on reducing costs through provider payments. Both sides are selective in their descriptions, and the article touches on the political dynamics between the campaigns.

Additionally, Ryan's background and his connection with Romney are briefly mentioned, but since the focus is on the Medicare debate, I'll keep that part minimal.

I need to make sure the summary is balanced, presenting both sides' arguments without bias. It's important to include the key arguments from both campaigns and the implications of each plan.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include Ryan's defense, the Obama campaign's counterarguments, the nature of the changes each plan proposes, and the broader political context of the Medicare debate in the 2012 election.

I'll aim for clarity and conciseness, ensuring that each sentence adds value and doesn't exceed the word limit. I'll avoid jargon and keep the language straightforward.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it accurately reflects the article's content and stays within the required word count.

SUMMARY: Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan in an interview with Fox News and a new TV ad, claiming it preserves Medicare while President Obama’s plan treats it as a "piggy bank" to fund Obamacare. Ryan argued that his plan, part of the Romney-Ryan campaign, saves Medicare for current seniors, unlike Obama’s plan, which he claims cuts $716 billion from the program. The Obama campaign disputes this, calling Ryan’s claims dishonest and pointing out that his budget would end Medicare as we know it, replacing it with vouchers. Ryan’s plan would give future retirees government payments to purchase private plans, which he says preserves Medicare, while Obama’s plan reduces payments to providers. Both sides are emphasizing their contrasting approaches to Medicare, with Romney’s campaign highlighting the "clear contrast" between their plan and Obama’s. The debate over Medicare is a key issue in the 2012 election, with each side accusing the other of damaging the program. END OF SUMMARY.
