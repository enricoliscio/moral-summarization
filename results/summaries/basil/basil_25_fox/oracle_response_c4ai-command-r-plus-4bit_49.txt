SUMMARY: Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan in an interview with Fox News, arguing that the "Romney-Ryan" plan preserves Medicare while President Obama's healthcare plan treats it like a "piggy bank." Ryan claimed that the Obama administration is "raiding" Medicare to pay for ObamaCare and damaging the program for current seniors. He emphasized that their plan offers a clear contrast by protecting Medicare for those in or near retirement. The Romney campaign released an ad accusing Obama of cutting Medicare to finance ObamaCare, while the Obama campaign disputed this claim, calling the ad "dishonest and hypocritical." Ryan's proposal aims to make changes for future retirees while preserving current benefits. The Obama campaign countered that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it, leaving seniors with a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits. Ryan argued that his plan would save Medicare and prevent a debt crisis. He also criticized Obama for his failure to create jobs and blamed his borrowing for dragging down economic growth. Obama, meanwhile, criticized Ryan's tax plan during a stop in Iowa, stating that their views are wrong.
