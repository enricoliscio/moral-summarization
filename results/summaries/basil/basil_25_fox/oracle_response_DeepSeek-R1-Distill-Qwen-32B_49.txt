Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Paul Ryan responding to criticism about his Medicare plan, comparing it to Obama's plan. The author used specific morally charged words like "save," "protect," "raid," "damage," etc. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Ryan is attacking Obama's plan, saying it treats Medicare as a piggy bank, while his plan preserves it. He claims Obama's plan is raiding Medicare to fund Obamacare. Ryan emphasizes that his plan doesn't cut benefits for current retirees, which he contrasts with Obama's cuts. The Obama campaign disputes this, calling Ryan's plan dishonest and hypocritical because it would end Medicare as we know it by replacing it with vouchers.

I need to include the moral words without changing the meaning. I'll structure the summary to highlight the contrast between the two plans using those words. I should mention Ryan's claims about saving and protecting Medicare, the accusation of raiding, and the Obama campaign's counterarguments about dishonesty and ending Medicare.

I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting into too much detail. Also, I need to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring I include all the necessary moral terms and the main arguments from both sides.

SUMMARY: Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan, claiming it saves, protects, and strengthens Medicare, while accusing Obama’s plan of raiding it to finance Obamacare. Ryan emphasized that his plan continues Medicare guarantees for current retirees, contrasting it with Obama’s cuts, which he says damage Medicare. The Obama campaign countered, labeling Ryan’s plan dishonest and hypocritical, arguing it would end Medicare as we know it by replacing it with vouchers. Ryan’s plan, which would give seniors government payments for private plans a decade from now, aims to prevent raids on Medicare funds. However, critics argue it slows benefit growth, effectively cutting Medicare benefits. Both sides highlight their commitment to Medicare, with Ryan focusing on preserving it and Obama on extending its life. The debate centers on contrasting visions of Medicare’s future, with Ryan’s plan emphasizing savings and Obama’s emphasizing fraud reduction and benefit continuation. END OF SUMMARY.
