SUMMARY:

Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, has responded to criticism over his Medicare plan, claiming that President Obama's healthcare plan treats Medicare like a "piggy bank" while the "Romney-Ryan" plan preserves it. Ryan stated that Obama's plan damages Medicare for current seniors, while their plan would strengthen it. The Romney campaign has released a new TV ad, which says Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare to pay for his healthcare law. The Obama campaign has disputed this argument, calling the ad "dishonest and hypocritical" and claiming that the Romney-Ryan plan would "end Medicare as we know it". Both sides have been selective in their descriptions of each other's plans. Ryan has also criticized Obama's job creation record and borrowing policies.
