Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words that the author used. The user has already provided the article and a list of the morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary, under 200 words, that includes as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Paul Ryan is defending his Medicare plan against criticism, accusing Obama's plan of raiding Medicare to finance ObamaCare. He claims his plan will save, protect, and strengthen Medicare, while Obama's plan is damaging it. The article also mentions that both campaigns are accusing each other of cutting Medicare benefits, with Democrats saying Ryan's plan ends Medicare as we know it.

I need to make sure to include words like "save," "protect," "raid," "damage," "cut," "finance," "restore," "end," etc. I should structure the summary to show the contrast between the two plans, highlighting the moral language used by each side.

I'll start by stating Ryan's defense, then mention his claims about Obama's plan, followed by the Obama campaign's counterarguments. I'll end with a note on the ongoing debate and accusations of dishonesty and hypocrisy.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points and moral terms. Let me draft that.

Both sides accuse each other of cutting Medicare benefits, with Ryan's plan slowing benefit growth and Obama's reducing payments to providers. The debate highlights the moral framing of saving versus damaging Medicare, with accusations of raiding, dishonesty, and hypocrisy. The campaign continues to focus on contrasting visions for Medicare's future. END OF SUMMARY.
