SUMMARY: Romney and Ryan went on the offensive, accusing President Obama of treating Medicare like a piggy bank. They claimed their plan preserves and strengthens the treasured entitlement program, while Obama's plan cuts $716 billion from it to pay for ObamaCare. Ryan argued that their plan offers a clear contrast, protecting Medicare for current seniors and achieving savings without ending the program. The Obama campaign disputed these claims, calling the Romney-Ryan ad dishonest and hypocritical. They asserted that Ryan's proposal ends Medicare as we know it, replacing guaranteed benefits with vouchers. Obama criticized Ryan's tax plan and views as wrong. Romney and Ryan, meanwhile, bonded on the campaign trail, sharing values and a vision for the country, with Ryan as the ideological leader of Republicans in Congress.
END OF SUMMARY.
