SUMMARY: Romney-Ryan campaign goes on offense to defend their Medicare plan, accusing Obama of treating the program like a "piggy bank" to finance ObamaCare. Ryan argues their plan preserves Medicare while Obama's plan cuts $716 billion from it. Obama campaign disputes this, claiming Romney-Ryan budget would "end Medicare as we know it," replacing guaranteed benefits with vouchers. Ryan's plan proposes changes for future retirees while maintaining benefits for current retirees. Ryan acknowledges his plan achieves "savings" for Medicare but says it preserves the program. Obama criticizes Ryan's tax plan, calling it "wrong." Ryan defends his plan, stating it will save Medicare and create jobs by reducing borrowing. He shares Romney's values and experience to get the country back on track. Ryan cites Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged" as an influence, critiquing socialism.
