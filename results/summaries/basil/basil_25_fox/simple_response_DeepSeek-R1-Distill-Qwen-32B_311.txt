Alright, so the user has given me a query where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They mentioned that I should act as both a news summarizer and a moral expert. The article is about Paul Ryan's defense of the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan against Obama's criticisms. 

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. Ryan is countering Obama's claims by stating that their plan preserves Medicare, while Obama's plan uses it as a piggy bank. The article also discusses the contrasting arguments between the two campaigns, with Democrats accusing Ryan of ending Medicare as we know it, and Republicans defending their approach.

I should focus on the moral arguments presented. Ryan's side frames the issue as protecting Medicare from being raided, emphasizing saving and strengthening it. Obama's campaign, on the other hand, accuses Ryan's plan of ending Medicare through vouchers, which they see as a betrayal of current seniors.

I need to ensure the summary captures these moral framings without taking sides. It's important to present both perspectives clearly, highlighting the accusations and defenses each side is making. Also, noting that both sides are selective in their descriptions will show the complexity of the debate.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's neutral yet comprehensive. I'll structure it by first introducing Ryan's defense, then the Democratic accusations, followed by the Republican counter, and finally the broader context of the campaign dynamics.

I'll make sure to include key details like the ad claims, the $716 billion figure, and the references to budget cuts and voucher systems. It's crucial to mention the differing views on how Medicare is being handled and the implications each side is highlighting.

Finally, I'll conclude by noting the ongoing debate and the accusations of dishonesty, ensuring that the moral framing is preserved throughout the summary. This way, the user gets a clear, balanced view of the moral arguments presented by both parties.

SUMMARY: Paul Ryan defended the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan in a Fox News interview, claiming it preserves Medicare while accusing Obama’s health care law of treating it as a “piggy bank.” Ryan emphasized that their plan saves Medicare for current seniors, while Obama’s plan cuts $716 billion from it to fund ObamaCare. Democrats, led by the Obama campaign, counter that Ryan’s proposals would end Medicare as we know it, replacing it with vouchers. Ryan argued that his plan ensures no changes for current retirees, while Obama’s cuts harm Medicare. Both sides are selective in their descriptions, with Republicans framing their plan as protective and Democrats accusing it of dismantling Medicare. The debate highlights contrasting views on Medicare’s future, with Ryan and Romney focusing on preserving the program and Obama’s campaign emphasizing the risks of Republican proposals. The moral framing centers on whether the plans protect or harm Medicare for seniors. END OF SUMMARY.
