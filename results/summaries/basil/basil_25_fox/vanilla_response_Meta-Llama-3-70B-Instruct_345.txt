SUMMARY:

Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, defended his Medicare plan in an interview with Fox News, claiming that President Obama's healthcare plan treats Medicare like a "piggy bank" and that the "Romney-Ryan" plan preserves it. Ryan argued that Obama's plan damages Medicare for current seniors, while their plan protects it. The Romney campaign released a new TV ad, stating that Obama's healthcare law cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for ObamaCare. The Obama campaign disputed this, saying that the savings do not cut guaranteed Medicare benefits and that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it. Both sides are being selective in describing each other's plans, with Ryan's proposal aiming to slow the rate of benefit growth for seniors and Obama's plan cutting payments to providers.

END OF SUMMARY.
