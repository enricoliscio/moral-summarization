SUMMARY: Paul Ryan, in his first interview since being named Mitt Romney's running mate, defended his Medicare plan and criticized President Obama's healthcare plan for raiding Medicare to fund it. Ryan argued that the "Romney-Ryan" plan preserves Medicare while Obama's plan cuts $716 billion from it. The Obama campaign has disputed this, claiming that Ryan's plan would "end Medicare as we know it." Both sides are selective in their descriptions, with Ryan's plan proposing changes for future retirees while achieving long-term "savings" for Medicare. Ryan also attacked Obama's economic record, blaming his borrowing for slow economic growth. Ryan discussed his relationship with Romney, saying they bonded while campaigning together and share similar views on policy issues. Obama, meanwhile, criticized Ryan's tax plan during a stop in Iowa, stating that their views are "wrong."
END OF SUMMARY.
