SUMMARY:

Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan, claiming it would "save", "protect", and "strengthen" the entitlement, while President Obama's healthcare plan is "raiding" it to "finance" ObamaCare. Ryan argued that Obama's plan is "damaging" Medicare for current seniors, and that his own plan would "restore" the cuts and "prevent" the raid. The Romney campaign released a TV ad saying Obama has "cut" $716 billion from Medicare to "pay" for ObamaCare. Ryan accused Obama of being "dishonest" and "hypocritical" in his criticism of the Romney-Ryan plan. The Obama campaign countered that Ryan's plan would "end" Medicare as we know it, leaving seniors with only a voucher. Ryan also criticized Obama's economic policies, saying they are "dragging" down economic growth and causing a "crisis". He emphasized the need to "get" people back to work and "create" jobs.
