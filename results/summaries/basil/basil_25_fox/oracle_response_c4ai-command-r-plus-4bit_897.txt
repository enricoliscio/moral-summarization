SUMMARY: Paul Ryan went on the offensive in response to criticism of his Medicare plan, claiming that President Obama's health care plan treats Medicare like a "piggy bank." Ryan argues that the "Romney-Ryan" plan preserves, protects, and strengthens Medicare, while Obama's plan raids and cuts it to finance ObamaCare. The Romney campaign released an ad accusing Obama of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to pay for his health care law. Ryan proposes changes to Medicare for future retirees while continuing benefits for current retirees, claiming that Obama is damaging Medicare for current seniors. The Obama campaign disputes this, arguing that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it, leaving seniors with a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits. Both sides are being selective in their descriptions, with Ryan's plan aiming to preserve Medicare and achieve savings by slowing benefit growth, while Obama's plan cuts payments to providers. Ryan also criticized Obama for his failure in job creation and blamed his heavy borrowing for dragging down economic growth. Obama, meanwhile, criticized Ryan's and Romney's tax plan, calling their views "wrong."
END OF SUMMARY.
