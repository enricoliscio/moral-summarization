SUMMARY: Paul Ryan defended his Medicare plan in an interview with Fox News, claiming that the Romney-Ryan plan preserves Medicare while President Obama's healthcare plan treats it like a "piggy bank." Ryan argued that the Obama administration is damaging Medicare for current seniors and that the Romney-Ryan ticket offers a plan to save, protect, and strengthen the program. He criticized Obama's healthcare law for cutting Medicare and emphasized that their plan proposes no changes for those in or near retirement. The Obama campaign has disputed Ryan's claims, stating that their savings do not cut guaranteed Medicare benefits and that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as it is currently known. Both sides are selectively describing each other's plans, with Ryan proposing changes for future retirees while maintaining benefits for current ones. Ryan also discussed his relationship with Romney and his admiration for novelist Ayn Rand. Meanwhile, Obama criticized Ryan's tax plan during a stop in Iowa, stating that Ryan is an ideological leader of Republicans but that their views are wrong.
