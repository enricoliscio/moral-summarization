SUMMARY:

The US Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service have announced that all same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This means that same-sex spouses must file tax returns together as "married filing jointly" or individually as "married filing separately", starting from the 2013 tax year. The ruling applies to all legal marriages made in the US or foreign countries, but does not extend to civil unions or other legal relationships. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the ruling, which provides certainty and equal treatment under federal tax laws. However, the ruling may have implications for same-sex couples' tax liabilities, and could create complications for couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages.

END OF SUMMARY.
