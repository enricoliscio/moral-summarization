SUMMARY: The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state of residence. This decision comes as a result of the Supreme Court's ruling in June that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. The ruling means that same-sex couples must file their federal tax returns as "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately," and may be eligible for refunds for prior tax years. While this decision provides certainty and equal treatment for same-sex couples, it also creates complications for couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages, as they will now have to file their federal and state tax returns differently. The ruling is expected to result in a small increase in federal revenue, offset by new spending on benefits for same-sex spouses. The Treasury decision is one of many federal rule changes being made to conform with the Supreme Court's decision, but inconsistencies remain among federal agencies in the way benefits are distributed to same-sex couples.
