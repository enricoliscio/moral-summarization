Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the federal recognition of same-sex marriages for tax purposes. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the article states that the Treasury Department and IRS have ruled that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal taxes, regardless of their state's laws. This is a significant change following the Supreme Court's decision striking down DOMA. The moral angle here is about equality and fairness—same-sex couples gaining federal benefits they were previously denied.

The article mentions that couples must file as married, either jointly or separately, and their location doesn't matter as long as the marriage is legal. This ensures they can move freely without changing their filing status. Groups like Human Rights Campaign praised this as a step towards equality, ending discrimination. However, there's a mention of the "marriage penalty," which could affect some couples financially. But the Treasury allows filing amended returns for refunds, which is positive.

On the flip side, the article notes complications for couples living in states that don't recognize their marriage. They have to file federal taxes as married but state taxes individually, which is a hassle. There's also the issue of varying standards across federal agencies, like Medicare using "place of celebration" while Social Security uses "place of residence." This inconsistency might raise fairness concerns.

The summary should highlight the federal recognition as a step toward equality, the benefits like tax refunds, and the challenges such as state complications and agency inconsistencies. I need to keep it under 200 words and include the moral framing about fairness and equality.

Let me structure the summary: Start with the main announcement, mention the implications for couples, the praise from rights groups, the financial impact, the state complications, and the inconsistency among federal agencies. Conclude with the broader push for equality despite challenges.

I should make sure the summary flows logically and covers all key points without being too detailed. Also, maintain the moral perspective by emphasizing equality and fairness throughout.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury Department and IRS have announced that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state where they reside. This decision, following the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling striking down the Defense of Marriage Act, ensures equal treatment under federal tax law. Couples must file as “married filing jointly” or “married filing separately,” with their location or wedding site irrelevant as long as the marriage is legal. This ruling provides clarity and fairness, allowing same-sex couples to access federal benefits and protections previously denied. However, it may complicate tax filings for couples in states that do not recognize their marriages, as they must file federal returns as married but state returns as individuals. The decision also raises questions about consistency across federal agencies, as some use different standards for benefits eligibility. Despite potential financial impacts, such as the “marriage penalty,” the ruling marks a significant step toward equality for same-sex couples nationwide. END OF SUMMARY.
