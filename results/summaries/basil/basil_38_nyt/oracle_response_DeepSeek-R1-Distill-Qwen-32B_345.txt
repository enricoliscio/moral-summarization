Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about the U.S. Treasury and IRS announcing that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This is a significant change following the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The key points include:

1. **Federal Recognition**: Same-sex couples are now recognized for federal taxes, even if their state doesn't recognize their marriage.
2. **Tax Filing Changes**: Couples must file as married, either jointly or separately, which could lead to a "marriage penalty" for some.
3. **State Complications**: States that don't recognize same-sex marriages will require couples to file federal returns as married but state returns as individuals, causing some paperwork issues.
4. **Benefits and Penalties**: Couples might get refunds by amending past returns, but not all will benefit equally due to the marriage penalty.
5. **Impact on Revenue**: The change is expected to slightly increase federal revenue but also increase spending on benefits for same-sex couples.
6. **Consistency Across Agencies**: Different federal agencies are implementing the ruling inconsistently, which could lead to questions about fairness and discrimination.

Now, the author used several morally charged words like "married," "decision," "treat," "entitled," "discriminatory," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary to preserve the moral framing.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the main points, ensuring the moral terms are used. I'll start with the announcement, mention the implications for tax filing, touch on state complications, benefits and penalties, and the inconsistency across agencies. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me draft the summary:

The U.S. Treasury and IRS have decided to recognize all legally married same-sex couples for federal tax purposes, ensuring they are treated equally regardless of their state's stance on marriage. This ruling provides guidance and assures couples of consistent federal recognition, ending the discriminatory effects of DOMA. Couples must now file as married, either jointly or separately, which may affect their tax liabilities. While some may benefit from refunds by amending past returns, others might face a "marriage penalty." States not recognizing same-sex marriages complicate tax filing, requiring federal and state returns to be handled differently. The ruling may slightly increase federal revenue but also expand benefits for same-sex couples. However, inconsistencies across federal agencies in implementing the decision raise questions about fairness and discrimination, as some couples may receive different benefits based on their state of residence.

That's within 200 words and includes the moral terms. I think this captures the essence while preserving the author's framing.
