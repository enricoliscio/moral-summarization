SUMMARY: The Treasury Department and the IRS announced that all same-sex couples legally married in the US or abroad will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This marks a significant change following the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act in June. The ruling ensures that same-sex couples are treated equally and fairly when it comes to federal tax laws and benefits, no matter where they reside. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the decision as a step towards justice and equality for LGBT individuals and their families. However, the ruling also creates complexities for same-sex couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages, as they will now have to file federal returns differently from their state returns. The Treasury's decision is part of a broader effort by the Obama administration to ensure that federal agencies swiftly implement the Supreme Court's ruling. This move is a testament to the government's commitment to upholding the rights and dignity of same-sex couples, sending a clear message that discrimination based on sexual orientation is unacceptable.
END OF SUMMARY.
