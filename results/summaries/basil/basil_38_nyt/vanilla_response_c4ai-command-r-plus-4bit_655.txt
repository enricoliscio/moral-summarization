SUMMARY: The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state of residence. This decision comes as a result of the Supreme Court's ruling in June that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. The ruling means that same-sex couples must file their federal tax returns as "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately," and they may also be eligible for refunds for prior tax years. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the ruling as a step towards equality, while some tax experts note that it may have financial implications for couples with similar incomes. The ruling also creates complications for same-sex couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages, as they will now have to file their federal and state tax returns differently. The Treasury ruling is one of many changes being made by federal agencies to conform with the Supreme Court decision, although the process of creating consistent regulations across agencies is still ongoing.
