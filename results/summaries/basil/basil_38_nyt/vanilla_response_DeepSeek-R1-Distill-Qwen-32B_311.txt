Okay, so the user has provided a news article and wants a summary. They mentioned I should act as a news summarizer assistant. The article is about the U.S. Treasury and IRS changing their policies to recognize same-sex marriages for federal tax purposes. 

First, I need to read through the article to understand the key points. The main points seem to be that legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal taxes regardless of their state's stance. They have to file as married, either jointly or separately. The address or wedding location doesn't matter as long as the marriage is legal. 

I should note that this is a significant change following the Supreme Court's decision on DOMA. The article also mentions the impact on tax liabilities, like the marriage penalty, and that couples can file amended returns for prior years. There's also the complication for couples living in states that don't recognize their marriage, affecting their state tax filings. 

Additionally, the article touches on other federal benefits, like Medicare, but mentions inconsistencies across agencies. The summary should include the main changes, the implications, and the reactions from groups involved. 

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. I'll start by stating the main policy change, then mention the filing requirements, the impact on taxes, the state complications, and the broader implications across federal agencies. I should end with the administration's push for consistent implementation. 

Let me make sure to include all key points without getting too detailed. Also, I need to avoid jargon and keep it clear for a general audience. 

I'll structure it as follows:
1. Introduction of the policy change.
2. Filing requirements and address irrelevance.
3. Impact on tax liabilities and possible refunds.
4. Complications in states not recognizing the marriage.
5. Broader implications and reactions from groups.
6. Mention of other federal benefits and inconsistencies.
7. Conclusion on the administration's efforts.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows logically.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury and IRS announced that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state's recognition of their marriage. Starting in 2013, same-sex spouses must file federal taxes as "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately," even if they live in states that do not recognize same-sex marriage. This change follows the Supreme Court's June decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act. Couples can file amended returns for prior tax years, potentially claiming refunds, though they are not required to if it increases their liability. The ruling also means couples can move freely without changing their federal filing status. However, complications arise for couples in states that do not recognize same-sex marriage, as they may need to file state taxes as individuals while filing federally as married. The policy change is part of a broader shift in federal regulations to align with the Supreme Court's ruling, though inconsistencies remain across agencies like Social Security. END OF SUMMARY.
