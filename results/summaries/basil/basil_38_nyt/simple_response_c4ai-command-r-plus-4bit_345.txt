SUMMARY: The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision comes after the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in June 2013 that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, which had denied federal benefits to same-sex couples. The Treasury Department's ruling ensures that same-sex couples will be treated equally under federal tax laws and have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the decision as a step towards fairness and equality for all married couples. However, the ruling may have financial implications for some same-sex couples, and it creates complications for couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages. The ruling also highlights inconsistencies in the way federal benefits are distributed to same-sex couples, with different agencies using different standards to determine eligibility. Despite these challenges, the Obama administration has pushed for a quick and smooth implementation of the Supreme Court's ruling, ensuring that all legally married same-sex couples are treated with the same dignity and respect as opposite-sex couples. END OF SUMMARY.
