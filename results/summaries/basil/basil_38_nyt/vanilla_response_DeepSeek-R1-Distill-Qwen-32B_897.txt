Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS announcing that same-sex couples legally married will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state's stance. This comes after the Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June.

I should note that this is a broad change, affecting how same-sex couples file their taxes. They must now file as married, either jointly or separately, regardless of where they live. This is a significant move towards equality, but there are complications, especially in states that don't recognize same-sex marriages. Couples might have to file federal returns as married but state returns as individuals, which could be a hassle.

Also, the article mentions that couples can file amended returns for prior years, which might lead to refunds. However, they aren't required to, so those who might face a marriage penalty can avoid back taxes.

The ruling applies to all legal marriages, including those in foreign countries, but not to civil unions or domestic partnerships. It's part of a broader effort by the federal government to align with the Supreme Court decision, but different agencies are handling it differently, leading to a patchwork of regulations.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these points clearly. I'll structure it to first state the main announcement, then mention the implications for tax filing, the complications in non-recognition states, the possibility of refunds, and the broader context of federal changes post-DOMA.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury Department and IRS have announced that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state's stance on same-sex marriage. This change, resulting from the Supreme Court's June decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), requires same-sex couples to file federal taxes as "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately," starting with the 2013 tax year. Couples can file amended returns for prior years to claim refunds, though they are not obligated to do so. The ruling applies to all legal marriages, including those in foreign countries, but excludes civil unions and domestic partnerships. While this move toward equality is praised by gay and civil rights groups, it creates complications for couples in states that do not recognize same-sex marriages, as they may need to file federal returns as married but state returns as individuals. The federal government is gradually updating regulations to align with the Supreme Court's decision, though agencies like Social Security and Medicare are implementing changes inconsistently. END OF SUMMARY.
