Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key points are about the federal recognition of same-sex marriages for tax purposes, the implications for couples living in states that don't recognize their unions, the marriage penalty, and the broader impact on federal benefits and regulations. 

I should make sure to include words like "married," "decision," "treat," "entitled," "marriage," "treated," "ruling," "guidance," "assures," "discriminatory," "recognize," "marriages," "access," "care," "nursing," "affecting," "discrimination," "fairness," "receive," "pushed," "ensure," "carried," "consistent." 

I'll start by stating the main decision by the Treasury and IRS. Then, mention the impact on couples regardless of their state's recognition. I'll include the marriage penalty and the ability to file amended returns. I'll also note the complications for states that don't recognize same-sex marriages and the varying standards across federal agencies. Finally, I'll mention the administration's push for consistency and fairness.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure all the key points are covered with the morally framed words.

SUMMARY:  
The Treasury Department and IRS have ruled that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized as married for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state's recognition of their union. This decision ensures that same-sex couples are treated equally under federal tax laws, providing clear guidance and certainty. Couples must file as "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately," and their address or wedding location does not matter, as long as the marriage is legal. This ruling assures couples they can move freely nationwide without changes to their federal filing status. Gay and civil rights groups praised the decision, calling it a step toward equality and access to benefits previously denied under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. However, the ruling may complicate tax filings for couples in states that do not recognize same-sex marriages, as they must file federal returns as married but may still file state returns as individuals. The decision also raises questions about fairness and discrimination, as federal agencies are implementing regulations inconsistently. For example, Medicare and the Treasury use a "place of celebration" standard, while Social Security uses a "place of residence" standard. The Obama administration has pushed for consistency, ensuring the Supreme Court's ruling is carried out smoothly. END OF SUMMARY.
