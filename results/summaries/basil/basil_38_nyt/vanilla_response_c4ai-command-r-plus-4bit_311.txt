SUMMARY: The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state of residence. This marks the broadest federal rule change following the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act in June 2023. The ruling means that same-sex couples must file their federal tax returns as "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately," and they may be eligible for refunds for prior tax years. However, this creates complications for couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages, as they will have to file their state returns as individuals. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the ruling, while tax experts note that it could increase federal revenue as more same-sex couples pay the "marriage penalty." The ruling is one of many emerging from federal agencies as they update regulations to conform with the Supreme Court decision, although inconsistencies in the regulations have been noted.
END OF SUMMARY.
