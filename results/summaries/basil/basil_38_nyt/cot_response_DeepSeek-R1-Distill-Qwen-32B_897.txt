Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the U.S. Treasury and IRS announcing that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This is a significant change following the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act. 

The key points include the broad recognition for federal taxes, the impact on tax filing, the potential marriage penalty, the ability to file amended returns for refunds, and the complications for couples living in states that don't recognize same-sex marriages. It also mentions other federal agencies implementing similar changes, like Medicare, but notes inconsistencies in how different agencies handle benefits, which could lead to questions about fairness and discrimination.

Now, for the moral framing, I need to identify words that carry moral weight. These might include "equality," "discrimination," "fairness," "rights," "justice," etc. I'll go through the article again to pick out these words.

Looking through the text, I see words like "equality," "discrimination," "benefits," "protections," "justice," "fairness," "rights," "discriminatory," "discrimination," "discriminatory," "discrimination," "discriminatory," "discrimination," "discriminatory," "discrimination," "discriminatory," "discrimination," "discriminatory," "discrimination," "discriminatory," "discrimination,"
