Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the U.S. Treasury and IRS announcing that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state's stance on same-sex marriage. This is a significant change following the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act.

The user provided a list of morally framed words that need to be preserved. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it too longâ€”under 200 words. 

I'll start by identifying the key elements: the recognition of same-sex marriages for federal taxes, the impact on tax filings, the reaction from civil rights groups, the potential complications with state taxes, and the broader implications for federal regulations and benefits.

I need to structure the summary to include the main points and use the moral terms. For example, using words like "married," "decision," "treat," "entitled," "marriage," etc. I should ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the announcement, its implications, reactions, and the challenges it presents.

I also need to mention the "marriage penalty" and how some couples might benefit from refunds. Additionally, the differing standards across federal agencies like the Social Security Administration using "place of residence" versus others using "place of celebration" is an important point about fairness and consistency.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary ends with the note about the Obama administration pushing for consistent implementation. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit while including all necessary moral framing elements.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury and IRS have decided to recognize all legally married same-sex couples for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state's stance on marriage. This ruling ensures that same-sex couples are treated equally under federal tax laws, providing clear guidance and certainty. Couples must file as "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately," with their marital status determined by the legality of their marriage, not their location. This decision follows the Supreme Court's landmark ruling striking down the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal benefits to same-sex couples. Gay and civil rights groups praised the move, as it grants same-sex couples access to crucial tax benefits and protections. However, the ruling may complicate tax filings for couples in states that do not recognize same-sex marriages, requiring them to file federal returns as married but state returns as individuals. The change could slightly increase federal revenue due to the "marriage penalty," but it may also lead to refunds for some couples. Federal agencies are implementing regulations inconsistently, raising questions about fairness and discrimination. The Obama administration has pushed for consistent implementation to ensure the Supreme Court's decision is carried out smoothly. END OF SUMMARY.
