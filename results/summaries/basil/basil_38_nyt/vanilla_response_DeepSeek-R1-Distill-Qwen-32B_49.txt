Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. government recognizing same-sex marriages for federal tax purposes. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

The article starts by stating that the Treasury Department and IRS have decided that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal taxes, regardless of the state they live in. This is a big change following the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act. The ruling affects the 2013 tax year and means couples must file as married, either jointly or separately, even if their state doesn't recognize their marriage.

The article mentions that this ruling provides clarity and certainty for same-sex couples, allowing them to move freely without worrying about their federal filing status. Gay rights groups are praising this move, saying it's a step towards equality. However, there are some complexities, especially for couples living in states that don't recognize same-sex marriages. They'll have to file federal taxes as married but might still file state taxes as individuals, which could be a hassle.

The article also notes that some couples might face a "marriage penalty," where their combined tax is higher than if they were single. But they don't have to file amended returns if they don't want to, so they won't owe back taxes. The change is expected to slightly increase federal revenue but also increase spending on benefits for same-sex couples.

Additionally, the ruling doesn't apply to civil unions or domestic partnerships, only legal marriages. Other federal agencies are making their own changes, like Medicare extending benefits, but there's inconsistency, such as Social Security using a different standard. The administration is pushing for smooth implementation, but there might be some confusion and questions about fairness.

So, to summarize, the key points are:
- Federal recognition of same-sex marriages for taxes, regardless of state laws.
- Impact on tax filing starting in 2013.
- Positive reaction from rights groups.
- Potential marriage penalty and amended returns.
- Complications for couples in non-recognition states.
- Inconsistencies across federal agencies.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. I should structure it to first state the main decision, then mention the implications, reactions, and any complexities or future considerations.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury Department and IRS have ruled that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state's recognition. This decision, effective for the 2013 tax year, requires couples to file as married, either jointly or separately, and applies nationwide. The ruling provides clarity and allows couples to move freely without tax status changes. Gay rights groups applaud the move toward equality, though complexities arise for those in non-recognition states, who may file federal taxes as married but state taxes individually. Some couples may face a "marriage penalty," but they aren't required to file amended returns. The change slightly increases federal revenue but also boosts spending on same-sex couple benefits. The ruling applies only to legal marriages, not civil unions or partnerships. Federal agencies are implementing changes inconsistently, with some using "place of celebration" and others "place of residence" standards. The administration aims for smooth implementation, though fairness questions remain. END OF SUMMARY.
