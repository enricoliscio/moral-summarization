SUMMARY:

In a landmark move, the US Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service have announced that all same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This ruling provides certainty and clear guidance for same-sex couples nationwide, ensuring they can move freely throughout the country without changing their federal filing status. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the decision, which marks a significant step towards equality under federal tax laws. However, the ruling may have implications for same-sex couples' tax liabilities, with some facing the "marriage penalty" and others eligible for refunds. The decision also creates complications for couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages, requiring a "cumbersome workaround" for tax filing. The ruling is part of a broader effort by the Obama administration to ensure the Supreme Court's decision is carried out quickly and smoothly.

END OF SUMMARY.
