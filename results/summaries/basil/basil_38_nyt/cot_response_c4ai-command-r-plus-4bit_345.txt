SUMMARY:
The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced that all same-sex marriages that are legally recognized will be treated equally for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state of residence. This marks a significant change following the Supreme Court decision in June that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. The ruling guarantees that same-sex couples will no longer be denied crucial tax benefits and protections based on discrimination. The change ensures fairness for all legally married same-sex couples, providing certainty and equal treatment under the nation's federal tax laws. The ruling also means that same-sex couples may face tax liabilities and will have to navigate complicated filing processes, especially in states that do not recognize their marriages. The Treasury ruling is part of a broader effort by federal agencies to align regulations with the Supreme Court decision, although inconsistencies in the distribution of benefits remain.
