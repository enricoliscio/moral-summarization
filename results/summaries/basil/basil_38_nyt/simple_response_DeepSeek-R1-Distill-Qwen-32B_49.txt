Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the federal tax recognition for same-sex couples. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the Treasury Department and IRS announcing that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal taxes, regardless of their state's laws. This is a significant change following the Supreme Court's decision on the Defense of Marriage Act. It mentions the impact on tax filing, benefits, and potential complications with state taxes.

I should highlight the positive aspects, like equal treatment and access to benefits, but also note the challenges such as the marriage penalty and state complications. The summary needs to be concise, around 200 words, and include the moral implications, emphasizing equality and fairness.

I'll structure the summary to start with the main announcement, then discuss the implications, both positive and challenging, and conclude with the broader impact on federal regulations and equality.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury Department and IRS have announced that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state's recognition of their marriage. This decision, following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act, ensures equal treatment under federal tax law. Same-sex couples must now file as "married" for federal returns, regardless of where they live or were married. This change provides clarity and benefits, such as access to federal tax advantages, but may also introduce complications, like the "marriage penalty," where couples pay higher taxes together than individually. States not recognizing same-sex marriages may require couples to file separately for state taxes, creating administrative challenges. The ruling is part of a broader effort to align federal policies with the Supreme Court's decision, though inconsistencies across agencies, like differing standards for benefits, remain. Advocates applaud the move toward equality, while experts note potential financial impacts and regulatory complexities. END OF SUMMARY.
