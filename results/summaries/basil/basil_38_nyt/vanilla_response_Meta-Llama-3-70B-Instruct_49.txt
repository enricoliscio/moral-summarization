SUMMARY:

The US Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have announced that all same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This means that same-sex spouses will have to file federal tax returns jointly or separately, and will be eligible for federal benefits. The ruling applies to all legal marriages made in the US or foreign countries, but does not extend to civil unions or registered domestic partnerships. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the ruling, saying it provides certainty and equal treatment under federal tax laws. However, the ruling may have implications for tax liabilities, and could create complications for same-sex couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages.

END OF SUMMARY.
