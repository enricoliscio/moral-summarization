Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about the U.S. Treasury and IRS announcing that same-sex couples legally married will be recognized for federal taxes, regardless of their state's laws. This is a significant change post the Supreme Court's DOMA decision.

The key points are: federal recognition, impact on tax filing, benefits and potential marriage penalties, complications in states that don't recognize same-sex marriage, and the broader implications across federal agencies.

I need to highlight the positive aspects like equality and benefits, but also mention the challenges and inconsistencies. The moral framing emphasizes fairness and rights, so I'll focus on that.

Now, I'll structure the summary: start with the main announcement, mention the benefits, touch on the complications, and conclude with the broader impact and potential issues. Keep it under 200 words and use the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury and IRS have announced that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state's laws. This decision, following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act, ensures equal treatment under federal tax laws. Same-sex couples must now file as married, either jointly or separately, and can amend prior returns for potential refunds. While this ruling provides clarity and benefits, it also introduces complications for couples in states that do not recognize same-sex marriage, as they may face discrepancies between federal and state tax filings. The change reflects a broader push for equality but highlights ongoing challenges in ensuring consistent treatment across federal agencies and states. END OF SUMMARY.
