Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first.

The article is about the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS announcing that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This is a significant change following the Supreme Court's decision in June that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). 

The key points I see are:

1. The ruling affects the 2013 tax year.
2. Same-sex couples must file as married, either jointly or separately.
3. Their location doesn't matter as long as the marriage is legal.
4. This provides clarity and allows couples to move without worrying about their filing status.
5. Gay and civil rights groups are praising the decision.
6. However, there might be a "marriage penalty" for some couples, but they don't have to file amended returns if they don't want to.
7. States that don't recognize same-sex marriages will have complications, as couples will file federally as married but may have to file state taxes as individuals.
8. The change is expected to slightly increase federal revenue but also increase federal spending on benefits.
9. The ruling applies to legal marriages in the U.S. or foreign countries, but not to civil unions or domestic partnerships.
10. Other federal agencies are making changes too, like Medicare, but there's inconsistency, such as the Social Security Administration using a different standard.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: the recognition of same-sex marriages for federal taxes, the implications for filing, the impact on couples, state complications, and the broader changes in federal regulations.

Let me structure it step by step:

- Start with the announcement by Treasury and IRS.
- Mention the June Supreme Court decision and DOMA.
- Explain the filing requirements for 2013 taxes.
- Highlight the location doesn't matter, as long as the marriage is legal.
- Note the reactions from groups and the potential marriage penalty.
- Discuss state complications and the need for state responses.
- Mention the impact on federal revenue and benefits.
- Conclude with the broader changes across federal agencies and the inconsistency in standards.

I need to make sure the summary is concise and covers all these points without going over 200 words.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury and IRS have announced that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state of residence. This follows the Supreme Court's June decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Starting in 2013, these couples must file federal taxes as married, either jointly or separately, with their location irrelevant as long as the marriage is legal. This ruling provides clarity and allows couples to move freely without changing their filing status. Gay rights groups applaud the decision, though some couples may face a "marriage penalty." States not recognizing same-sex marriages may require couples to file federally as married but individually for state taxes. The change slightly increases federal revenue but also boosts spending on benefits. The ruling applies to legal marriages in the U.S. or abroad, excluding civil unions. Other federal agencies, like Medicare, are adapting, but there's inconsistency, such as Social Security using a residence-based standard. END OF SUMMARY.
