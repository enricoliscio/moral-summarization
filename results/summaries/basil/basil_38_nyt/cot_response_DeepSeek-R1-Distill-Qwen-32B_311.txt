Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. Let me break down what they need.

First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. The user mentioned this as STEP 1, and each word should be listed with an asterisk. I'll go through the article and look for words that carry moral connotations, like "discriminatory," "equality," "fairness," etc.

Next, I have to summarize the article, preserving the moral framing. The summary needs to be concise, no longer than 200 words, and should include as many of the morally framed words as possible. I'll start by identifying the main points: the Treasury Department's decision to recognize same-sex marriages for federal taxes, the implications on tax filing, the praise from rights groups, the potential marriage penalty, and the complications with state laws. I'll make sure to include terms like "discriminatory," "equality," and "discrimination" to maintain the moral perspective.

I also need to ensure that the summary is clear and captures the essence of the article without getting bogged down in too many details. It's important to highlight both the positive changes and the challenges faced, such as the marriage penalty and state-level issues. I'll structure the summary to first state the main decision, then discuss the implications, followed by the reactions and potential complications.

I should also check that the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me make sure I'm not missing any key points, like the impact on federal revenue or the differing standards across federal agencies. Including these elements will provide a comprehensive overview while maintaining the moral framing.

Finally, I'll present the summary after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." to adhere to the user's formatting requirements. I need to be careful to list each morally framed word correctly in STEP 1 and ensure the summary is both accurate and concise.

**SUMMARY:**  

The Treasury Department and IRS announced that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state of residence. This decision, following the Supreme Court’s overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act, ensures equal treatment under federal tax laws. Couples must now file as “married filing jointly” or “married filing separately,” eliminating the option to file as single. The ruling also allows couples to amend prior tax returns for refunds, though they can opt out to avoid the “marriage penalty.” However, complications arise in states that do not recognize same-sex marriages, as couples may need to file state taxes as individuals while filing federally as married. Advocacy groups praised the move for promoting equality and fairness, while experts noted potential financial impacts and administrative challenges. The decision reflects the federal government’s commitment to ending discrimination and ensuring equal access to benefits, though inconsistencies across agencies and states may persist.  

**END OF SUMMARY.**
