SUMMARY:

The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have announced that all same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This ruling treats gay couples in the same way as straight couples, providing certainty and clear guidance for tax filing. Legally married same-sex couples will no longer be able to file federal tax returns as single individuals, but must file together as "married filing jointly" or individually as "married filing separately." This decision assures same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country without changing their federal filing status. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the ruling, which provides access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. The ruling may have implications for tax liabilities, with some couples facing the "marriage penalty," but others may be eligible for refunds. The move is part of the government's efforts to ensure fairness and consistency in the distribution of federal benefits.
