SUMMARY:

The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have announced a landmark ruling, recognizing all same-sex couples who are legally married as married for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision treats gay couples equally under federal tax laws, providing certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide. The ruling assures that these families will have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. Same-sex couples will now be able to file joint tax returns, and may be eligible for refunds. However, the ruling creates complications for couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages, requiring a cumbersome workaround for state tax returns. The Obama administration has pushed federal agencies to ensure the Supreme Court's ruling is carried out quickly and smoothly, aiming for consistency in the distribution of federal benefits.
