SUMMARY:
The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have announced that all same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This ruling provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, ensuring they are treated equally under federal tax laws. Committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. However, the ruling may have ramifications for many gay couples' tax liabilities, and states may respond with changes of their own. The Obama administration has pushed for federal agencies to ensure the Supreme Court's ruling is carried out quickly and smoothly, but inconsistencies remain. END OF SUMMARY.
