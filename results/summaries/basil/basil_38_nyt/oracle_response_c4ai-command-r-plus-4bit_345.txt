SUMMARY: The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced a broad federal rule change in recognition of same-sex marriages for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state of residence. This decision is a result of the Supreme Court's ruling in June that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act and ensures that all legally married same-sex couples are treated equally when it comes to federal tax laws and benefits. The ruling states that as of the 2013 tax year, same-sex spouses must file federal tax returns as "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately," regardless of their address or the location of their wedding. This decision provides certainty and clear guidance for same-sex couples, assuring them that their federal filing status will not change even if they move to a different state. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the ruling, which also allows couples to file amended returns for prior tax years and potentially receive refunds. While the ruling simplifies federal tax filing for same-sex couples, it creates complications for those living in states that do not recognize their marriages, as they will still have to file state returns as individuals. The Treasury ruling is one of many changes being made by federal agencies to ensure that the Supreme Court's decision is carried out fairly and consistently across the country.
END OF SUMMARY.
