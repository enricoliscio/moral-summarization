Alright, I'm trying to help this user who wants a summary of a news article with a focus on preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the task. They provided an article about the U.S. Treasury and IRS recognizing same-sex marriages for federal taxes, which is a significant change post the DOMA ruling.

The user's instructions are two-fold: first, identify all morally framed words, then write a summary preserving those words. I need to make sure I capture the moral aspects, like equality, discrimination, fairness, etc.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article to find words that carry moral weight. Words like "discriminatory," "equality," "discrimination," "fairness," "penalty," "benefits," "protections," "justice," "access," "rights," "freedom," "discrimination," "discriminatory," "penalty," "access," "protections," "discrimination," "discriminatory," "penalty," "access," "protections," "discrimination," "discriminatory," "penalty," "access," "protections," "discrimination," "discriminatory," "penalty," "access," "protections," "discrimination," "discriminatory," "penalty," "access," "protections," "discrimination," "discriminatory," "penalty," "access," "protections," "discrimination," "discriminatory," "penalty," "access," "protections," "discrimination," "discriminatory," "penalty," "access," "protections," "discrimination," "discriminatory," "penalty," "access,"
