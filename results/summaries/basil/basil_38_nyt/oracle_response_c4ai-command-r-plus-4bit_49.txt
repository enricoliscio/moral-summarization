SUMMARY: The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced a broad federal rule change to recognize all legally married same-sex couples for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state of residence. This decision is a response to the Supreme Court's June ruling that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act and a move towards treating gay couples equally to straight couples. The Treasury Department's ruling provides guidance and assurance to same-sex couples that they will be treated equally and will not face discriminatory tax policies. It also assures them that their federal filing status will not change, even if they move to a different state. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the ruling, stating that it provides access to crucial tax benefits and protections that were previously denied to same-sex spouses. However, the ruling may create complications for couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages, as they will have to file federal and state tax returns differently. The rule change is expected to increase federal revenue, as more same-sex couples will pay the "marriage penalty." The ruling applies to all legal marriages in the United States and foreign countries but does not extend to civil unions or domestic partnerships. This decision is part of a wider effort by the Obama administration to ensure that federal agencies are moving consistently towards ensuring fairness and equal treatment for gay and lesbian couples.
END OF SUMMARY.
