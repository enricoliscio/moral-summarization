SUMMARY: The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced a broad federal rule change on Thursday, stating that all same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state of residence. This decision comes in the wake of the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in June that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. The new ruling ensures that same-sex couples are treated equally and are entitled to the same federal benefits as heterosexual couples. It provides guidance and certainty for same-sex couples, who will no longer be discriminated against based on their state of residence. The ruling also assures same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country without worrying about their federal filing status changing. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the decision, which is a significant step towards ensuring fairness and equal treatment for all married couples. However, the ruling creates some complications for same-sex couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages, as they will now have to file their federal and state tax returns differently. Overall, the Treasury's decision is a positive move towards recognizing and treating all married couples equally, regardless of their sexual orientation.
END OF SUMMARY.
