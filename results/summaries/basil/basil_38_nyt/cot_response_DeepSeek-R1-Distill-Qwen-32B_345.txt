Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the U.S. Treasury and IRS deciding to recognize all legally married same-sex couples for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state's stance. This is a significant change following the Supreme Court's ruling on DOMA.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words. These are words that carry a judgment or ethical implication. Words like "discriminatory," "penalty," "equality," "fairness," "discrimination," "discriminate," "benefits," "protections," "rights," "discriminatory," "penalty," "discrimination," "discriminate," "benefits," "protections," "rights," "discriminatory," "penalty," "discrimination," "discriminate," "benefits," "protections," "rights." These words highlight the moral aspects of the issue, such as fairness, equality, and discrimination.

Next, I'll write a concise summary that includes these moral terms. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the Treasury's decision, the implications for same-sex couples, the marriage penalty, state complications, and the broader impact on federal benefits and revenue.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes the moral framing without being too technical. I'll mention the benefits and protections, the marriage penalty, the state complications, and the overall move towards equality, while noting the complexities and potential for discrimination in state-level issues.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to reflect the positive changes in federal recognition while acknowledging the challenges and inconsistencies that still exist, especially in states that don't recognize same-sex marriages. This should capture the moral implications effectively.

**SUMMARY:**
The U.S. Treasury and IRS have ruled that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state's stance on same-sex marriage. This decision, following the Supreme Court's landmark ruling striking down the Defense of Marriage Act, ensures equal treatment under federal tax laws. Couples must file as "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately," eliminating the "marriage penalty" for many. However, this change may complicate tax filings for couples in states that do not recognize same-sex marriages, as they may need to file federal returns as married but state returns as individuals. The ruling also allows couples to file amended returns for prior years, potentially securing refunds. While this move advances equality and reduces discrimination, it highlights ongoing disparities in state-level tax administration. Federal agencies are implementing the ruling inconsistently, raising questions about fairness in benefit distribution. The decision marks a significant step toward equality but leaves some challenges unresolved.
