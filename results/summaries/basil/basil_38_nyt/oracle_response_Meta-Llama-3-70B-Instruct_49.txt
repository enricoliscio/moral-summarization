SUMMARY:

The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have announced that all same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This ruling ensures that same-sex couples are treated equally under federal tax laws, without discrimination. They will be entitled to file tax returns jointly or separately, just like straight couples. This decision is a significant step towards fairness, as it provides certainty and clear guidance for same-sex couples nationwide. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the ruling, saying it finally gives same-sex couples access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them. However, the ruling may have implications for tax liabilities, and some couples may face the "marriage penalty." The Treasury decision is part of a broader effort by the Obama administration to ensure that federal agencies carry out the Supreme Court's landmark decision quickly and smoothly, without discrimination or unfairness.
