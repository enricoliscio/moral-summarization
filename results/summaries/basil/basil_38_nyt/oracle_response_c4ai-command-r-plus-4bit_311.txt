SUMMARY: In a landmark decision, the Treasury Department and the IRS ruled that all same-sex couples legally married will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state of residence. This ruling ensures that same-sex couples are treated equally and are entitled to the same federal benefits as straight couples. The ruling provides guidance and assurance to same-sex couples, who no longer have to worry about their federal filing status changing when they move throughout the country. Gay and civil rights groups praised the ruling, stating that it eliminates discriminatory practices and provides access to crucial tax benefits and protections for same-sex married couples. However, the ruling may have financial ramifications for some couples, and creates complications for those living in states that do not recognize their marriages. The federal government is moving quickly to implement consistent regulations that ensure fairness and non-discrimination, but challenges remain in creating a cohesive framework for distributing benefits. This ruling is a significant step towards recognizing and treating same-sex marriages equally, and is part of a broader effort by the Obama administration to ensure that the Supreme Court's decision is carried out smoothly and swiftly. 

END OF SUMMARY.
