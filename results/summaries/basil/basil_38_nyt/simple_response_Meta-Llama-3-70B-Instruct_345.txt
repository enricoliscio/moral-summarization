SUMMARY:

In a landmark move, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced that all same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This ruling provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, ensuring they can move freely throughout the country without changing their federal filing status. Gay and civil rights groups praised the ruling, stating that it treats committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples equally under federal tax laws. However, the decision may have ramifications for many gay couples' tax liabilities, and creates complications for same-sex couples who live in states that do not recognize their marriages. The ruling is part of a broader effort by the Obama administration to ensure that federal agencies conform to the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act.
