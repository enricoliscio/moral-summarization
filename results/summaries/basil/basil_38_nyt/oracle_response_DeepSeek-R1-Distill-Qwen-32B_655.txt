Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words the author used. My task is to create a summary using as many of those words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I need to read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the U.S. Treasury and IRS announcing that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state's recognition. This is a significant change following the Supreme Court's decision on the Defense of Marriage Act. The summary needs to highlight the key points: the federal recognition, the impact on tax filing, the benefits and potential marriage penalties, and the complications with state taxes.

I should identify the morally framed words from the list provided and ensure they are included. Words like "married," "decision," "treat," "entitled," "marriage," "treated," "ruling," "guidance," "assures," "discriminatory," "recognize," "marriages," "access," "care," "nursing," "affecting," "discrimination," "fairness," "receive," "pushed," "ensure," "carried," "consistent."

I need to structure the summary to cover the main aspects: the federal recognition, the tax implications, the response from groups, the complications with states, and the broader impact on federal regulations. I should ensure that the moral implications are clear, such as the end of discrimination, access to benefits, and the need for fairness and consistency.

I'll start by stating the key decision and its impact on recognition. Then mention the tax filing changes, the benefits, and the marriage penalty. Include the praise from civil rights groups and the complications with state taxes. Finally, touch on the broader regulatory changes and the push for consistency.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while incorporating the moral framing words. I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: The Treasury Department and IRS have decided to recognize all legally married same-sex couples for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state where they live. This ruling, following the Supreme Court's landmark decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act, ensures that same-sex couples are treated equally under federal tax laws. Couples must file as "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately," and their address or wedding location does not affect their status. This guidance assures legally married same-sex couples of consistent federal treatment nationwide, ending discriminatory practices. Gay and civil rights groups praised the decision, noting it provides access to crucial tax benefits and protections. However, the ruling may affect tax liabilities, as same-sex couples may face the "marriage penalty." Couples can file amended returns for prior years but are not required to do so. The decision also creates complications for couples in states that do not recognize same-sex marriages, as they must file federal returns as married but may still file state returns as individuals. The ruling reflects the federal government's push to ensure the Supreme Court's decision is carried out consistently, though challenges remain in achieving fairness and equality in benefits distribution. END OF SUMMARY.
