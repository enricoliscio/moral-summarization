SUMMARY:

The US Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service have announced that all same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This means that same-sex spouses will have to file tax returns together, either as "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately". The ruling applies to all legal marriages made in the US or foreign countries, but does not extend to civil unions or other legal relationships. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the decision, which provides certainty and clear guidance for same-sex couples nationwide. However, the ruling may have implications for tax liabilities, with some couples potentially facing the "marriage penalty". The decision also creates complications for same-sex couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages.

END OF SUMMARY.
