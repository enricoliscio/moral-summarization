Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about the U.S. Treasury and IRS announcing that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state's recognition. This is a significant change following the Supreme Court's decision on the Defense of Marriage Act. The ruling affects tax filing, allowing couples to file jointly or separately, and ensures they can move freely without changing their filing status. It also mentions the potential marriage penalty, refunds for prior years, and complications with state taxes. Additionally, it touches on other federal benefits like Medicare and Social Security, noting inconsistencies in how different agencies are handling the changes.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on the main points: the federal recognition, the impact on tax filing, the marriage penalty, state complications, and the broader implications for federal benefits. I should use the moral terms provided, such as "married," "decision," "treat," "entitled," "marriage," "ruling," etc.

I'll start by stating the main announcement, then explain the implications for tax filing, mention the marriage penalty and refunds, touch on state complications, and finally discuss the broader federal benefits and the need for consistency. I'll make sure to include the key moral terms to maintain the author's framing.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring it's concise and includes the necessary moral language.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. Treasury and IRS have ruled that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state's recognition. This decision, following the Supreme Court's landmark ruling on the Defense of Marriage Act, ensures that same-sex couples are treated equally under federal tax laws. Couples must now file as "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately," with their marital status determined by the legality of their marriage, not their location. This ruling assures couples they can move freely nationwide without changing their filing status. Gay and civil rights groups praised the decision, calling it a step toward equality and access to previously denied benefits. However, the marriage penalty—higher taxes for couples with similar incomes—may affect some. Couples can file amended returns for prior years, potentially receiving refunds, though they are not required to do so. The ruling complicates tax filing for couples in states that do not recognize same-sex marriages, as they must file federal returns as married but may still file state returns as individuals. The decision also impacts federal benefits like Medicare and Social Security, though agencies are applying different standards, raising questions about fairness and discrimination. The Obama administration has pushed for swift implementation of the Supreme Court's ruling, though inconsistencies remain. END OF SUMMARY.
