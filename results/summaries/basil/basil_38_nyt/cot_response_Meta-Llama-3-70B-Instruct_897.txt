SUMMARY:
The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have announced that all same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This landmark decision provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, ensuring they are treated equally under federal tax laws. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the ruling, stating that it finally gives committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. However, the ruling may create complications for same-sex couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages, and may raise questions about fairness and discrimination in the distribution of federal benefits.
