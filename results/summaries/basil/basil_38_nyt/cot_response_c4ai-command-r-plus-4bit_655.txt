SUMMARY:
In a landmark ruling, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced that all same-sex couples legally married in the United States or foreign countries will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state of residence. This ruling, praised by gay and civil rights groups, is the broadest federal change following the Supreme Court decision that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act in June. The ruling guarantees same-sex couples equal access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. It assures legally married same-sex couples that they will be treated fairly and will not face discrimination in federal tax filing, regardless of where they live or move to. While this ruling creates a more cumbersome tax filing process for same-sex couples in states that do not recognize their marriages, it is seen as a positive step towards ensuring smooth and consistent administration of benefits for all legally married couples across the nation. The Obama administration continues to push federal agencies to act quickly and ensure the Supreme Court's ruling is carried out smoothly. END OF SUMMARY.
