SUMMARY:

The US Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service announced that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This means that same-sex couples must file tax returns as "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately", rather than as single individuals. The ruling applies to all legal marriages in the US and foreign countries, but does not extend to civil unions or domestic partnerships. Gay and civil rights groups praised the decision, which provides certainty and equal treatment under federal tax laws. However, the ruling may have implications for tax liabilities, and same-sex couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages may face complications. The decision is part of a broader effort by the federal government to conform to the Supreme Court's landmark decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act.
