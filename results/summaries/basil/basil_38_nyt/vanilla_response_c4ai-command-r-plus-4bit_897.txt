SUMMARY: The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision comes as a result of the Supreme Court's ruling in June that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. The ruling means that same-sex couples must file their federal tax returns as "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately," and they may also be eligible for refunds for prior tax years. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the ruling as a step towards equality, while some tax experts note that it could lead to complications for same-sex couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages. The ruling is expected to result in a small increase in federal revenue as more same-sex couples pay the "marriage penalty." The Treasury ruling is one of many changes being made by federal agencies to conform with the Supreme Court decision, although inconsistencies in the way benefits are distributed have been noted.
END OF SUMMARY.
