Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article. They mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer assistant. The article is about the U.S. Treasury and IRS announcing that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state's stance on their marriage.

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. The key points seem to be:

1. The federal government will recognize same-sex marriages for tax purposes, even if the state doesn't.
2. This is a result of the Supreme Court striking down the Defense of Marriage Act.
3. Same-sex couples must file as married, either jointly or separately, starting in 2013.
4. The ruling affects couples across all states, including those where same-sex marriage isn't recognized.
5. There are implications for tax liabilities, potential marriage penalties, and the ability to file amended returns for refunds.
6. State taxes might still require filing as individuals, leading to complications.
7. Federal agencies are implementing changes, but there's inconsistency in how benefits are applied across different agencies.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should make sure to include the main actions taken by the Treasury and IRS, the implications for couples, and the broader context of federal versus state laws.

I should start with the announcement, then explain the implications, mention the benefits and potential penalties, and note the inconsistencies across federal agencies. I also need to ensure clarity and conciseness, avoiding jargon where possible.

Let me structure it:

- Introduction: Federal recognition of same-sex marriages for tax purposes.
- Details: Must file as married, regardless of state.
- Implications: Marriage penalty, amended returns, state complications.
- Broader context: Federal vs. state laws, varying agency implementations.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in specifics like the number of states or the names of organizations unless they're crucial. The focus should be on the main changes and their effects.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary without exceeding 200 words.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Treasury and IRS announced that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state's stance on same-sex marriage. This ruling, effective for the 2013 tax year, requires same-sex couples to file as "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately," eliminating the option to file as single. The decision follows the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act in June. Couples can file amended returns for prior years to claim refunds, though they aren't required to. The ruling simplifies federal tax filing for same-sex couples but complicates state taxes in non-recognition states, where couples may still file individually. Federal agencies are implementing changes inconsistently, with some using a "place of celebration" standard for benefits, while others, like Social Security, use a "place of residence" standard. This creates potential disparities in benefits for couples living in different states. The ruling aims to ensure equal treatment under federal tax laws but may increase tax liabilities for some couples due to the "marriage penalty." END OF SUMMARY.
