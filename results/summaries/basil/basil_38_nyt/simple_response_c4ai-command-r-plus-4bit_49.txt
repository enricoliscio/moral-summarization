SUMMARY: The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced that all same-sex couples legally married in the United States or foreign countries will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This decision comes as a result of the Supreme Court's ruling in June that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal benefits to same-sex couples. The Treasury Department's ruling ensures that all legally married same-sex couples will be treated equally under federal tax laws and have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the decision as a step towards equality and fairness. However, the ruling also creates complications for same-sex couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages, as they will now have to file their federal returns differently than their state returns. The ruling is expected to increase federal revenue as more same-sex couples pay the "marriage penalty," but it will also result in new federal spending on benefits for same-sex spouses. The Treasury ruling is one of many changes being made by federal agencies to conform with the Supreme Court decision, but inconsistencies in regulations across agencies have raised questions about discrimination and fairness. The Obama administration continues to push for quick and smooth implementation of the Supreme Court's ruling.
END OF SUMMARY.
