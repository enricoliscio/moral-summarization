SUMMARY:

The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have announced that all same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state where they live. This ruling provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, assuring them that they can move freely throughout the country without changing their federal filing status. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the ruling, stating that it treats committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples equally under federal tax laws, regardless of their state of residence. The ruling also allows same-sex couples to file amended returns for certain prior tax years, potentially leading to refunds. However, it may create complications for couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages, requiring a cumbersome workaround. The ruling is part of a broader effort by the Obama administration to ensure that federal agencies carry out the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act in a fair and consistent manner.

END OF SUMMARY.
