SUMMARY:

The US Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service have announced that all same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This ruling provides certainty and clear guidance for same-sex couples, ensuring they can move freely throughout the country without changing their federal filing status. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the ruling, stating that it treats committed and loving same-sex couples equally under federal tax laws. However, the ruling may have ramifications for many gay couples' tax liabilities, and could create complications for those living in states that do not recognize their marriages. The ruling is a significant step towards equality, but inconsistencies in federal agencies' approaches to implementing the Supreme Court's decision may raise questions about discrimination and fairness.
