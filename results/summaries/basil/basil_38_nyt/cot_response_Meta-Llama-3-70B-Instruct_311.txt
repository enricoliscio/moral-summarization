SUMMARY:
The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced that all same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state where they live. This ruling provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, ensuring they are treated equally under federal tax laws. Gay and civil rights groups praised the ruling, stating that committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. However, the ruling may have complications for same-sex couples who live in states that do not recognize their marriages, potentially leading to a cumbersome workaround and questions about fairness and discrimination in the distribution of federal benefits.
