Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Treasury and IRS recognizing same-sex marriages for federal tax purposes. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The article mentions that same-sex couples legally married will be recognized for federal taxes, regardless of their state's stance. This is a significant change post the Supreme Court's decision on DOMA. It affects how they file taxes, either jointly or separately, and they can amend past returns for refunds. However, there are complications in states that don't recognize same-sex marriages, leading to more paperwork. There's also mention of the "marriage penalty" and how some couples might end up paying more. Federal agencies are moving at different paces, causing a patchwork of regulations, which could lead to questions about fairness.

Now, the moral framing here is about equality and fairness. The article highlights the government moving towards treating same-sex couples equally, which is a positive step. However, it also points out potential issues like the marriage penalty and complications in non-recognizing states, which could be seen as unfair or discriminatory. The summary needs to capture both the progressive change and the lingering inequalities.

I should structure the summary to first state the main change, then mention the positive aspects, followed by the complications and potential issues. Keeping it under 200 words, I need to be concise but comprehensive.

Let me draft this:

The U.S. Treasury and IRS have announced that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state's recognition. This decision follows the Supreme Court's ruling on the Defense of Marriage Act and marks a significant step toward equality. Couples can now file jointly or separately, and can amend past returns for potential refunds. However, complications arise in states that don't recognize same-sex marriages, requiring separate state filings. This change may lead to a "marriage penalty" for some couples, increasing their tax liability. While federal agencies are implementing this change, they are doing so inconsistently, raising questions about fairness and discrimination. The move is a positive step toward equality but highlights ongoing challenges in achieving uniformity and fairness across the U.S.

Wait, that's a bit over 200 words. Let me trim it down, ensuring I keep the moral aspects.

Final version:
The U.S. Treasury and IRS have recognized same-sex marriages for federal taxes, regardless of state laws, following the Supreme Court's DOMA ruling. This move promotes equality, allowing couples to file jointly or separately and amend past returns for refunds. However, complications arise in non-recognizing states, requiring separate state filings. The change may cause a "marriage penalty" for some couples, increasing their tax burden. While this is a step toward equality, inconsistencies across federal agencies highlight ongoing fairness issues. END OF SUMMARY.

That should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the moral framing.
