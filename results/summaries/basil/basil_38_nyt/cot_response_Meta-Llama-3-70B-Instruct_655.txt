SUMMARY:
The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have announced that all same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This ruling provides certainty and clear guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide, ensuring they are treated equally under federal tax laws. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the ruling, saying it finally gives these families access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. While the ruling may create complications for same-sex couples who live in states that do not recognize their marriages, it is a significant step towards fairness and equality. The Obama administration has pushed for federal agencies to ensure the Supreme Court's ruling is carried out quickly and smoothly, aiming to provide equal coverage and benefits to all same-sex spouses.
