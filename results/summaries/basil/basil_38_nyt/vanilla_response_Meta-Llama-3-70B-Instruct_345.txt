SUMMARY:

The US Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service announced that all same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, regardless of the state they live in. This means that same-sex spouses must file federal tax returns jointly or separately, and will be eligible for federal benefits and tax refunds. The ruling applies to all legal marriages made in the US or foreign countries, but does not extend to civil unions or registered domestic partnerships. Gay and civil rights groups praised the decision, saying it provides certainty and equal treatment under federal tax laws. However, the ruling may create complications for same-sex couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages, and may result in some couples paying the "marriage penalty" or having to file amended returns.

END OF SUMMARY.
