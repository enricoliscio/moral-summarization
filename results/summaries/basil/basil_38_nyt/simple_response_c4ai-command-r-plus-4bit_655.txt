SUMMARY: The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced that all legally married same-sex couples will be recognized for federal tax purposes, regardless of their state of residence. This decision follows the Supreme Court's ruling in June 2013 that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, which had denied federal benefits to same-sex couples. The Treasury Department's ruling ensures that same-sex couples are treated equally and fairly, allowing them to file joint tax returns and access crucial tax benefits and protections. Gay and civil rights groups have praised the decision as a victory for equality and love. However, the ruling may result in tax complications for same-sex couples living in states that do not recognize their marriages, as they will have to file federal and state tax returns differently. The ruling also highlights inconsistencies in the way federal benefits are distributed to same-sex couples, with different standards being used by different agencies. The Obama administration is pushing for a consistent and smooth implementation of the Supreme Court's ruling across all federal agencies. This decision is a significant step forward in ensuring equal rights and recognition for same-sex couples in the United States.
END OF SUMMARY.
