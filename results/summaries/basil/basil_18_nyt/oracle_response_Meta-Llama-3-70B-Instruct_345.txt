SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has released a new campaign ad that contrasts Christianity with homosexuality, vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." In the ad, Perry admits to being a Christian and criticizes the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell" policy, highlighting the perceived inequality of gays serving openly in the military while children are restricted from celebrating Christmas or praying in school. Perry's ad is seen as an appeal to hard-right conservatives, particularly in Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers identify as Christian evangelicals. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay men and lesbian group, who argue that being a person of faith does not preclude supporting equality. Perry's message is one of fighting against liberal attacks on religious heritage, emphasizing that faith made America strong and can do so again. The ad's tone is one of moral urgency, calling for an end to the perceived war on religion and a return to traditional values.

END OF SUMMARY.
