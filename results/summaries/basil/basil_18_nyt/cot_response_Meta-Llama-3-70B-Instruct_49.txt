SUMMARY:
Governor Rick Perry of Texas has released a new campaign ad that appeals to hard-right conservatives, contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." Perry, who is not "ashamed" to admit he's a Christian, criticizes the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell" and claims that there's something "wrong" in the country when gays can serve openly in the military but kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He promises to "fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage" and claims that "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again." The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, who argue that Perry's stance is "wrong" and that individual liberty and responsibility are core American values. END OF SUMMARY.
