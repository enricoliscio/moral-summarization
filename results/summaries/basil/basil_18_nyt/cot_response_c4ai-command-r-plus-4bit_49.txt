SUMMARY: 
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas released a new campaign ad targeting hard-line conservatives that appears to pit Christianity against homosexuality. In the ad, Perry vows to end "Obama's war on religion," criticizing the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell" and pledging to fight against "liberal attacks on our religious heritage." Perry asserts that "faith made America strong," implying that it can restore its strength. The ad contrasts being a Christian with supporting gay rights, suggesting that celebrating Christmas and praying in school are under attack while gays serve openly in the military. The ad was denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, who argued that supporting equality and individual liberty and responsibility are in line with the values of the founding fathers and do not contradict one's faith. The group criticized Perry for assuming that faith precludes support for equality. The ad reflects Perry's appeal to Christian evangelicals in Iowa and his stance against gay rights, framing the issue as a moral conflict between religion and liberalism.
