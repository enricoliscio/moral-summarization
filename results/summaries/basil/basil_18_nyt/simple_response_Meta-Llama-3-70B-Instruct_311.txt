SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has released a campaign ad that appeals to hard-right conservatives, contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." The ad highlights Perry's criticism of allowing gays to serve openly in the military and implies that Christians are being persecuted. Perry claims that faith made America strong and can do so again, while ignoring the principles of individual liberty and responsibility that the country was founded upon. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group, which argues that being a person of faith does not mean one cannot support equality. Perry's message is divisive and harmful, promoting a false dichotomy between religion and homosexuality.

END OF SUMMARY.
