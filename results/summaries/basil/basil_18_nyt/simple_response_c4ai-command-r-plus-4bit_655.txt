SUMMARY: In a blatant appeal to homophobic sentiment among hard-right conservatives, Texas Governor Rick Perry released a new campaign ad that uses Christianity as a weapon against the LGBTQ+ community. Perry vows to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion," criticizing the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell" and expressing outrage that gays can serve openly in the military while children cannot "openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school." Perry's ad is a disgraceful attempt to pit religious freedom against LGBTQ+ rights, implying that one must be chosen over the other. This false dichotomy is a dangerous and regressive mindset that has no place in modern society. The ad was denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, who rightfully pointed out that individual liberty and equality are core values of both our nation's founding principles and the Christian faith. Perry's appeal to bigotry and intolerance is a disturbing reminder of the persistent homophobia in American politics. It is a shameful tactic that preys on fear and ignorance to gain political support.
END OF SUMMARY.
