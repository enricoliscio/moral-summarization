Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Texas Governor Rick Perry's new campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives. The ad contrasts Christianity with homosexuality, which is a strong statement. He's talking about ending Obama's so-called "war on religion" and criticizing the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell." 

In the ad, Perry emphasizes his Christian faith and criticizes policies that allow gays in the military while restricting religious expressions in schools. He's focusing on Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers are Christian evangelicals. The ad also responds to Obama's promotion of gay rights internationally. 

Opposition comes from Log Cabin Republicans, who argue against Perry's assumption that religious people can't support equality. They criticize his approach as theocratic rather than aligned with American values of liberty.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting Perry's ad, its content, target audience, and the opposition. I should make sure it's clear and concise, capturing the main points without getting too detailed.

The ad contrasts Christianity with homosexuality, vows to end what Perry calls "Obama’s war on religion," and criticizes the repeal of the "don’t ask, don’t tell" policy for gays in the military. Perry argues that while gays can serve openly in the military, religious expressions like celebrating Christmas or praying in schools are restricted.

Perry also criticized Obama’s promotion of gay rights globally, stating he would fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage.
