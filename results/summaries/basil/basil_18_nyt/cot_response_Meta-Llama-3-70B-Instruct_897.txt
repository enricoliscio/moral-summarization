SUMMARY:
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has released a new campaign ad that appeals to hard-right conservatives, contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." In the ad, Perry says, "I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a Christian," and criticizes the Obama administration's efforts to promote gay rights globally. Perry argues that faith made America strong and can do so again, while accusing liberals of attacking the country's religious heritage. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay men and lesbian group, which argues that supporting equality is in line with the nation's founding principles of individual liberty and responsibility. Perry's ad is seen as a bid to win over Christian evangelicals in Iowa, a key voting bloc in the Republican caucus. END OF SUMMARY.
