SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has released a new campaign ad that appeals to hard-right conservatives, contrasting Christianity with homosexuality. In the ad, Perry vows to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion" and highlights his criticism of overturning the "don't ask, don't tell" policy for gays serving in the military. Perry states, "I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a Christian" and argues that it's wrong that gays can serve openly in the military while kids can't celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad is likely to run in Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers identify as Christian evangelicals. The Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group, has denounced the ad, saying it's wrong to assume that being a person of faith means not supporting equality.

END OF SUMMARY.
