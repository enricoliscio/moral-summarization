SUMMARY: In a new campaign ad, Texas Governor Rick Perry appeals to hard-right conservatives by contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end "Obama's war on religion." Perry criticizes the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell" and claims that gays can serve openly in the military while children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad will likely run in Iowa, targeting Christian evangelical caucusgoers. Perry also pledges to fight against "liberal attacks on our religious heritage," stating that faith can make America strong again. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, who argue that being a person of faith does not preclude support for equality. They criticize Perry for seeking to be a "theocrat-in-chief" rather than a commander-in-chief.
