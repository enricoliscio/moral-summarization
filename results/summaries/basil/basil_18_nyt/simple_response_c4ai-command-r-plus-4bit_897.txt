SUMMARY: In a new campaign ad, Texas Gov. Rick Perry appeals to hard-right conservatives by contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." Perry criticizes the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell," suggesting that it is wrong that gays can serve openly in the military while children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad, aimed at Christian evangelicals in Iowa, also highlights Perry's criticism of the Obama administration's efforts to promote gay rights globally. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, who argue that supporting equality is consistent with being a person of faith. They criticize Perry for aspiring to be a "theocrat-in-chief" rather than a commander-in-chief. Perry's ad reflects a problematic moral framework that perpetuates discrimination and religious favoritism, and ignores the foundational American values of equality, liberty, and religious freedom.

END OF SUMMARY.
