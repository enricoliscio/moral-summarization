SUMMARY: In an attempt to appeal to hard-right conservative voters, Texas Governor Rick Perry has released a new campaign ad that emphasizes his Christian faith and criticizes the Obama administration's stance on gay rights and religious expression. The ad suggests that Christianity is under attack and that gay rights are being prioritized over religious freedom. Perry vows to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion" and criticizes the overturning of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy, claiming that it is wrong that gays can serve openly in the military while children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, who argue that supporting equality and being a person of faith are not mutually exclusive. The group's executive director, R. Clarke Cooper, criticized Perry for seeking to be a "theocrat-in-chief" rather than a commander-in-chief. The ad is part of Perry's multimillion-dollar television campaign budget, primarily targeting Iowa's large population of Christian evangelical voters.
