SUMMARY: In a new campaign ad, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas appeals to hard-right conservatives by contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and criticizing the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell." Perry vows to end "Obama's war on religion" and highlights his opposition to the open service of gays in the military, while claiming that children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad, aimed at Christian evangelicals in Iowa, has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, who argue that supporting equality is consistent with being a person of faith. Perry defends his stance by promising to fight against "liberal attacks" and restore America's religious heritage, claiming that "faith made America strong."

END OF SUMMARY.
