SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has released a new campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives, contrasting Christianity with homosexuality. In the ad, Perry vows to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion" and criticizes the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell" policy for gays in the military. Perry claims that while gays can serve openly in the military, children are not allowed to celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad is part of Perry's multimillion-dollar TV budget, focused on Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers identify as Christian evangelicals. The ad follows Perry's statement criticizing the Obama administration's promotion of gay rights worldwide. The Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, denounced the ad, saying it's wrong to assume that people of faith cannot support equality. The group argues that open service by gay and lesbian servicemembers aligns with the vision of the founding fathers.
