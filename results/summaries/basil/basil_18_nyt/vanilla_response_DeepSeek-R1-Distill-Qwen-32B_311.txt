Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Governor Rick Perry's campaign ad. Let me read through the article first.

So, the article talks about Perry's new ad targeting hard-right conservatives. It seems to contrast Christianity with homosexuality. He's against Obama's so-called "war on religion" and criticizes the end of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy in the military. 

In the ad, Perry says he's a Christian but points out that you don't have to attend church every week to see that something's wrong in the country. He mentions that gays can serve openly in the military but kids can't celebrate Christmas or pray in school. That's a strong statement, comparing religious freedom with military service.

The ad is focusing on Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers are Christian evangelicals. So, Perry is targeting that demographic. 

He also criticized Obama's promotion of gay rights through diplomacy and foreign aid. His ad says he'll end Obama's war on religion and fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage. He believes faith made America strong and can do so again.

The Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, are against this ad. They say Perry shouldn't assume that being religious means you don't support equality. They argue that the nation was built on individual liberty, and allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly aligns with the founding fathers' vision.

So, the summary needs to capture all these points: Perry's ad targeting conservatives, the contrast between Christianity and homosexuality, his criticism of Obama's policies, the focus on Iowa, and the criticism from the LGBTQ+ group.

I should structure the summary to include all these elements concisely, making sure it's under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the ad's purpose, then the main points of the ad, the target audience, and the opposition's response. That should cover everything succinctly.
