Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Texas Governor Rick Perry's new campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives. He's contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and promising to end what he calls Obama's war on religion. He also criticizes the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell." 

Perry says he's a Christian and questions why gays can serve openly in the military while kids can't celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad is focusing on Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers are Christian evangelicals. 

He's responding to Obama's promotion of gay rights through diplomacy and foreign aid. The ad also mentions fighting against liberal attacks on religious heritage. The Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, are criticizing Perry, saying his assumption is wrong and that being a person of faith doesn't exclude supporting equality. They argue that open service by gays and lesbians aligns with the founding fathers' vision.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Perry's ad targeting hard-right conservatives, his stance on religion and homosexuality, and his criticism of the administration's gay rights promotion. Then, I'll note the ad's focus on Iowa and the criticism from Log Cabin Republicans about equality and the founding principles.

I should make sure to include all key points without going over the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each main point is covered concisely.
