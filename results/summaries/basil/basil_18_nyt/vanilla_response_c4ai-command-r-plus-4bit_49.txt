SUMMARY: In an attempt to appeal to hard-right conservative voters, Texas Governor Rick Perry released a new campaign ad that emphasizes his Christian faith and criticizes the Obama administration's policies on gay rights and the separation of church and state. Perry claims that he will end "Obama's war on religion" and defend Christianity, which he suggests is under attack in America. The ad also highlights Perry's opposition to the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell," suggesting that it is wrong that gays can serve openly in the military while children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad is targeted at evangelical Christian voters in Iowa, a key early voting state. The ad has been criticized by gay rights groups, who argue that Perry is wrongly equating Christianity with opposition to equality and that open service by gay and lesbian service members is in line with the values of individual liberty espoused by the founding fathers.
END OF SUMMARY.
