Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about Governor Rick Perry's new campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives. The ad seems to contrast Christianity with homosexuality, and Perry is talking about ending Obama's supposed war on religion. He also criticizes the overturning of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy.

First, I should identify the key points. The ad is part of Perry's campaign, targeting Christian evangelicals in Iowa. He's using religious themes to appeal to them, contrasting the ability of gays to serve openly in the military with kids celebrating Christmas or praying in school. That's a moral contrast between religious freedom and gay rights.

Perry is positioning himself as a defender of religious heritage, saying faith made America strong. He's also reacting to Obama's promotion of gay rights through diplomacy, which he opposes. The ad has been criticized by Log Cabin Republicans, who argue that supporting equality doesn't conflict with being a person of faith. They're concerned about Perry's stance on mixing religion with governance.

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements: Perry's ad, the contrast between religious practices and gay rights, his criticism of Obama's policies, the target audience (Iowa evangelicals), and the criticism from the gay rights group.

I should also keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral framing as presented in the article. So, I'll structure it by introducing Perry's ad, its content, the target audience, his stance on Obama's policies, and the criticism he's receiving.

Let me make sure I'm not adding any personal opinions, just summarizing the facts while preserving the moral angles. The article presents Perry's perspective and the opposing view from Log Cabin Republicans, so I should include both sides.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures all necessary points.
