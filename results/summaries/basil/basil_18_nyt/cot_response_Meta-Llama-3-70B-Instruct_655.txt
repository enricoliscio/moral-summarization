SUMMARY:
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has released a new campaign ad that contrasts Christianity with homosexuality, vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." In the ad, Perry proudly declares, "I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a Christian," and criticizes the overturning of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy for gays serving in the military. He argues that it's "wrong" that gays can serve openly in the military, but kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry's ad is targeted at hard-right conservatives, particularly in Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers identify as Christian evangelicals. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay men and lesbian group, which argues that Perry's stance is at odds with the nation's founding principles of individual liberty and responsibility.
