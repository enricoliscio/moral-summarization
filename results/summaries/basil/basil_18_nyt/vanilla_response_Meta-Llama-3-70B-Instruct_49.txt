SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has released a new campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives, contrasting Christianity with homosexuality. In the ad, Perry vows to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion" and criticizes the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell" policy, allowing gays to serve openly in the military. Perry claims that while gays can serve openly, kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad is likely to run in Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers identify as Christian evangelicals. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group, which argues that being a person of faith does not mean one cannot support equality. The group's executive director, R. Clarke Cooper, stated that open service by gay and lesbian servicemembers aligns with the vision of the founding fathers.

END OF SUMMARY.
