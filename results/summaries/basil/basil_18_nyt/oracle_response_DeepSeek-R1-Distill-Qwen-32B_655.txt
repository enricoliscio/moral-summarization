Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read the article carefully to understand the main points. It's about Governor Rick Perry's campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives, focusing on contrasting Christianity with homosexuality. He's criticizing Obama's policies on religion and the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.

The user specified that I should use the morally framed words provided: contrast, war, admit, celebrate, pray, end, fight, attacks, strong, being, support, equality, liberty. I need to incorporate as many of these as possible into the summary.

I should start by identifying the key elements: Perry's ad, the contrast between Christianity and homosexuality, his vows to end the "war on religion," and his criticism of military policy. Then, mention the ad's focus on Iowa's Christian evangelicals. Include his statements about faith making America strong and the opposition from Log Cabin Republicans, who argue against equating faith with opposing equality.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while including the moral terms. I'll structure it to highlight Perry's actions, the moral contrast he's making, his vows, and the criticism from the group. I'll also touch on the themes of liberty and equality as opposing views.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral term is appropriately placed. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and make sure the summary accurately reflects the article's content and moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has released a campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives, contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end what he calls "Obama’s war on religion." The ad highlights Perry’s criticism of overturning the "don’t ask, don’t tell" policy, allowing gays to serve openly in the military, while asserting that kids shouldn’t feel ashamed to celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry emphasizes his Christian identity, stating, "I’m not ashamed to admit that I’m a Christian," but argues that even without attending church every Sunday, one should recognize the moral imbalance in society. The ad, focusing on Iowa’s Christian evangelical population, follows Perry’s criticism of the Obama administration’s promotion of gay rights through diplomacy and foreign aid. He pledges to "fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage," claiming faith made America strong and can do so again. However, the ad has been denounced by Log Cabin Republicans, who argue it’s "wrong for Governor Perry to assume being a person of faith does not afford one to support equality." They emphasize that the U.S. was founded on individual liberty and that open service by gay and lesbian servicemembers aligns with the vision of the founding fathers.  
END OF SUMMARY.
