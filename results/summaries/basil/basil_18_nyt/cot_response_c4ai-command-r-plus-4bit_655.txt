SUMMARY:
Governor Rick Perry of Texas has released a new campaign ad that appeals to hard-right conservatives by contrasting Christianity with homosexuality. In the ad, Perry vows to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion," criticizing the overturning of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy and the promotion of gay rights abroad. Perry emphasizes his Christian faith, stating that it is wrong that gays can serve openly in the military while children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, who argue that supporting equality and individual liberty and responsibility are in line with the vision of the founding fathers and do not conflict with one's faith. Perry's multimillion-dollar television budget has focused on Iowa, targeting Christian evangelical caucusgoers. The ad reinforces Perry's stance against what he perceives as liberal attacks on America's religious heritage and his promise to fight for faith to make the country strong again.
