SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has released a new campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives, contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end "Obama's war on religion." In the ad, Perry says he's not ashamed to be a Christian and criticizes the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell" policy, implying that it's wrong for gays to serve openly in the military while kids can't celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad is likely to run in Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers identify as Christian evangelicals. Perry's statement follows his criticism of the Obama administration's promotion of gay rights globally. The Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, denounced the ad, saying it's wrong to assume that people of faith can't support equality. They argue that open service by gay and lesbian servicemembers aligns with the nation's founding principles of individual liberty and responsibility.
