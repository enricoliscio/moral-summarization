SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has launched a new campaign ad that contrasts Christianity with homosexuality, vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion". In the ad, Perry admits to being a Christian and criticizes the overturning of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy for gays in the military. He argues that it's wrong that gays can serve openly in the military, but kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry's ad is part of a multimillion-dollar television budget focused on Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers identify as Christian evangelicals. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group, which argues that being a person of faith does not mean one cannot support equality. Perry's ad promises to fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage, emphasizing that faith made America strong and can do so again.
