Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Governor Rick Perry's campaign ad. I need to make sure I understand the key points. The article talks about Perry targeting hard-right conservatives with an ad that contrasts Christianity with homosexuality. He's criticizing Obama's policies, specifically the end of "don't ask, don't tell" and promoting gay rights internationally. 

I should note that Perry is emphasizing his Christian values and linking them to issues like Christmas and prayer in schools. The ad is running in Iowa, where there are many Christian evangelicals. Also, there's a response from Log Cabin Republicans criticizing Perry's stance, saying it's wrong to equate faith with opposing equality.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main elements: Perry's ad content, his criticism of Obama, the target audience in Iowa, and the opposition from the LGBTQ+ group. I should make sure to include the key quotes and the opposing viewpoint to give a balanced summary.

Let me structure it: start with Perry's ad targeting conservatives, mention the contrast between Christianity and homosexuality, his criticism of Obama's policies, the ad's focus on Iowa, and then the criticism from Log Cabin Republicans. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has released a campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives, emphasizing his Christian values and criticizing President Obama’s policies on religion and LGBTQ+ rights. The ad contrasts Christianity with homosexuality, condemns the repeal of the "don’t ask, don’t tell" policy, and accuses Obama of waging a "war on religion." Perry vows to end this perceived conflict and defend religious heritage, while highlighting issues like celebrating Christmas and praying in schools. The ad is part of Perry’s multimillion-dollar TV campaign, focusing on Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers are Christian evangelicals. The ad has been criticized by Log Cabin Republicans, who argue that Perry’s stance equates faith with opposition to equality, and accuse him of prioritizing theology over national principles of liberty and responsibility. END OF SUMMARY.
