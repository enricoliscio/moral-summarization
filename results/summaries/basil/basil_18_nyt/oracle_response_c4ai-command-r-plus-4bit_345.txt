SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas broadcasts a new campaign ad that appeals to hard-right conservatives and seems to contrast Christianity with homosexuality. In the ad, Perry vows to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion" and criticizes the overturning of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy for gays in the military. Perry emphasizes his Christian faith and claims that there is something wrong when gays can serve openly but children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad is targeted towards Christian evangelicals in Iowa. Perry's statement criticizes the Obama administration's use of diplomacy to promote gay rights worldwide. He pledges to fight against "liberal attacks" on religious heritage and believes faith can make America strong again. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, who argue that supporting equality and individual liberty is in line with the vision of the founding fathers.
END OF SUMMARY.
