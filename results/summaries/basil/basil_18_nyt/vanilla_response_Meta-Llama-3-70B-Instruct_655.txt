SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has released a new campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives, contrasting Christianity with homosexuality. In the ad, Perry vows to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion" and criticizes the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell" policy for gays in the military. Perry states, "I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a Christian... but you don't need to be in the pew every Sunday to know there's something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school." The ad is likely to air in Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers identify as Christian evangelicals. The Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group, has denounced the ad, saying it's wrong to assume that people of faith can't support equality. Perry's ad has sparked controversy, with critics accusing him of promoting discrimination.
