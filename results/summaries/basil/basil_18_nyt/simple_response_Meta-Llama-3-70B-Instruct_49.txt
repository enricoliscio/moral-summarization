SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has released a new campaign ad that appeals to hard-right conservatives by contrasting Christianity with homosexuality. The ad vows to end what Perry calls "Obama's war on religion" and highlights his criticism of allowing gays to serve openly in the military. Perry claims that faith made America strong and can do so again, implying that Christianity is under attack. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group, who argue that being a person of faith does not mean one cannot support equality. The group's executive director, R. Clarke Cooper, stated that open service by gay and lesbian servicemembers aligns with the vision of the founding fathers, emphasizing individual liberty and responsibility. Perry's ad has sparked controversy, with some seeing it as an attack on the LGBTQ+ community and others viewing it as a defense of religious heritage.
