Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article about Gov. Rick Perry's new campaign ad. The user provided the article and the previous summary, but they want me to think through the process of creating that summary.

First, I'll read the article carefully to understand the main points. The article talks about Perry's ad targeting hard-right conservatives. The ad contrasts Christianity with homosexuality, criticizes Obama's policies on religion and military service, and targets Iowa where many caucusgoers are Christian evangelicals.

I should identify the key elements: Perry's campaign ad, its target audience, the main criticisms (war on religion, overturning don't ask don't tell), quotes from Perry, and the reactions from Log Cabin Republicans.

Next, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the purpose of the ad, then mention the criticisms and quotes. Finally, include the opposition's response.

I should ensure the summary is clear, concise, and captures all essential points without going into too much detail. Also, I need to maintain a neutral tone and stick to the facts presented in the article.

Now, I'll structure the summary: start with the ad's purpose, then the criticisms, quotes, and end with the opposition's stance. I'll make sure each sentence is concise and flows logically.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all important details are included without any unnecessary information.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has released a campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives, emphasizing his Christian values and criticizing President Obama's policies on religion and gay rights. The ad contrasts Christianity with homosexuality, condemns Obama's "war on religion," and opposes the repeal of the "don’t ask, don’t tell" policy for gays in the military. Perry states, "I’m not ashamed to admit that I’m a Christian," while criticizing the cultural shift allowing gays to serve openly in the military but restricting Christmas celebrations and prayer in schools. The ad is part of Perry’s multimillion-dollar TV campaign, focusing on Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers are Christian evangelicals. Perry also condemns Obama’s use of diplomacy to promote global gay rights, vowing to protect religious heritage. Log Cabin Republicans, a LGBTQ advocacy group, criticized the ad, calling it "wrong" for assuming faith precludes support for equality. R. Clarke Cooper, the group’s director, accused Perry of prioritizing religion over individual liberty, contrary to the founding principles of the U.S.  
END OF SUMMARY.
