SUMMARY:
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has released a new campaign ad that appeals to hard-right conservatives, contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." Perry claims that as president, he will fight against "liberal attacks" on America's "religious heritage" and restore the country's strength through faith. The ad highlights Perry's criticism of overturning the "don't ask, don't tell" policy for gays serving in the military and his opposition to promoting gay rights worldwide. The Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group, denounced the ad, saying it's "wrong" to assume that people of faith cannot support "equality." Perry's ad is seen as an attempt to appeal to Christian evangelicals in Iowa, where he has focused his multimillion-dollar television budget. END OF SUMMARY.
