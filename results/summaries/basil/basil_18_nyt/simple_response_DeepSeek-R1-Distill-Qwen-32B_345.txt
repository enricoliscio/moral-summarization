Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Governor Rick Perry's new campaign ad. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article mentions that Perry is targeting hard-right conservatives with an ad that contrasts Christianity with homosexuality. He's against Obama's policies, specifically the end of "don't ask, don't tell" and promoting gay rights internationally. His ad emphasizes his Christian values and criticizes the current administration for attacking religion.

I should note that the ad highlights issues like celebrating Christmas and praying in schools, contrasting them with gays serving openly in the military. This sets up a moral contrast between religious freedom and gay rights. The target audience is Christian evangelicals in Iowa, which is a key state for the Republican caucus.

The Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group, criticized Perry, saying his approach is wrong and that he's mixing religion with policy. They argue that supporting equality doesn't contradict being religious. They also point out that the Founding Fathers valued individual liberty, which includes allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral arguments from both sides. I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented in the article. The summary should include Perry's campaign focus, the content of the ad, the criticism from the gay rights group, and their counterarguments.

Putting it all together, I'll start by stating Perry's campaign ad targets hard-right conservatives, then outline the main points of the ad, mention the criticism from Log Cabin Republicans, and conclude with their counterpoints about individual liberty and the Founding Fathers' vision.

I should double-check that the summary flows well and accurately reflects the moral framing without adding any bias. Also, ensure that it's within the word limit and properly formatted with the tokens as specified.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has released a campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives, emphasizing his Christian values and criticizing what he calls "Obama’s war on religion." The ad contrasts the ability of gays to serve openly in the military with the supposed restrictions on celebrating Christmas and praying in schools, framing this as a moral issue. Perry vows to protect religious heritage and end what he perceives as liberal attacks on faith. The ad is part of Perry’s multimillion-dollar television campaign, focusing on Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers identify as Christian evangelicals.  

Perry’s ad follows his criticism of the Obama administration’s promotion of gay rights globally, which he opposes. He argues that faith made America strong and can do so again. However, the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group, condemned the ad, stating that Perry’s assumption that religious faith precludes support for equality is wrong. They argue that supporting gay rights aligns with the principles of individual liberty and responsibility, as envisioned by the Founding Fathers.  

END OF SUMMARY.
