Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. The user mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Governor Rick Perry of Texas releasing a campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives. The ad contrasts Christianity with homosexuality and criticizes Obama's policies on religion and the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Perry is emphasizing his Christian values and attacking the administration's stance on gay rights.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral arguments presented. Perry is framing the issue as a conflict between religious freedom and gay rights. He's using strong language like "war on religion" and linking faith to national strength. On the other hand, the Log Cabin Republicans are countering that supporting equality and religious faith aren't mutually exclusive.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include key points: Perry's ad targeting conservatives, the contrast between Christianity and homosexuality, criticism of Obama's policies, the ad's focus on Iowa, and the opposing views from the Log Cabin Republicans.

I need to maintain the moral framing without adding my own opinions. So, I'll present both sides as they are in the article. Make sure to mention the ad's content, its target audience, and the reactions it received.

Let me structure the summary: start with Perry's ad and its purpose, then outline the main points of the ad, mention the target state (Iowa), and include the opposing viewpoint from Log Cabin Republicans. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes all necessary elements while preserving the moral arguments.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has released a campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives, emphasizing his Christian values and criticizing what he calls "Obama’s war on religion." The ad contrasts Christianity with homosexuality, highlighting Perry's opposition to the repeal of the "don’t ask, don’t tell" policy for gays in the military. Perry argues that while gays can serve openly in the military, religious freedoms, like celebrating Christmas or praying in schools, are under threat. The ad, which has not yet specified its airing locations, is part of Perry's multimillion-dollar TV campaign focused on Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers identify as Christian evangelicals.  

Perry also condemns the Obama administration's promotion of gay rights through diplomacy and foreign aid, vowing to protect religious heritage as president. However, his stance has been criticized by Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian advocacy group, which argues that supporting equality and religious faith are not mutually exclusive. The group accused Perry of prioritizing a theocratic agenda over American values of liberty and responsibility.  

END OF SUMMARY.
