SUMMARY: In a new campaign ad, Texas Gov. Rick Perry appeals to hard-right conservatives by contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." Perry, who is not afraid to admit his Christian faith, criticizes the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell" and the Obama administration's efforts to promote gay rights globally. He pledges to fight against "liberal attacks" on religious heritage, stating that faith made America strong and can make it strong again. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, who argue that supporting equality and being a person of faith are not mutually exclusive. They criticize Perry for aspiring to be a "theocrat-in-chief" rather than a commander-in-chief.
