Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Gov. Rick Perry is running ads targeting hard-right conservatives, focusing on religion and homosexuality. He's contrasting Christianity with homosexuality, which is a strong moral statement. He mentions ending Obama's "war on religion," using charged words like "war" and "attacks." 

Perry also talks about kids celebrating Christmas and praying in school, which are moral issues about freedom of religion. He criticizes the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell," tying it to military service. The ad is running in Iowa, targeting Christian evangelicals, which shows a strategic moral appeal.

The Log Cabin Republicans are against this, saying it's wrong to assume faith means opposing equality. They emphasize liberty and responsibility, contrasting with Perry's stance. I need to include words like contrast, war, admit, celebrate, pray, end, fight, attacks, strong, being, support, equality, liberty.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Perry's moral arguments, the contrast he makes, the war metaphor, and the criticism from the group. I'll ensure all key moral terms are included without exceeding 200 words. Let me draft that, making sure each point is clear and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is targeting hard-right conservatives with a campaign ad that contrasts Christianity with homosexuality, vowing to end what he calls “Obama’s war on religion.” The ad emphasizes Perry’s criticism of overturning the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, stating, “I’m not ashamed to admit that I’m a Christian,” while questioning why gays can serve openly in the military but kids can’t celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry’s multimillion-dollar ad campaign focuses on Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers are Christian evangelicals. The ad follows Perry’s criticism of the Obama administration’s promotion of gay rights globally. He pledges to “end Obama’s war on religion” and “fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage,” claiming faith made America strong. The Log Cabin Republicans denounced the ad, calling it wrong for Perry to assume faith excludes support for equality. They argue open service by gays and lesbians aligns with the founding fathers’ vision of liberty and responsibility.  
END OF SUMMARY.
