Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words to include. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points. 

The article talks about Governor Rick Perry's campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives. He's contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and criticizing Obama's policies. The ad mentions ending a "war on religion" and fighting against liberal attacks. He also links the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell" to issues like celebrating Christmas and praying in school. 

I need to make sure the summary includes words like contrast, war, admit, celebrate, pray, end, fight, attacks, strong, being, support, equality, liberty. I should structure the summary to highlight Perry's moral stance and the reactions against it. 

I should start by mentioning Perry's ad and its target audience. Then, outline the main points of the ad, including the contrast between Christianity and homosexuality, the "war on religion," and the military policy. I'll include his statements about faith and America's strength. 

Next, I need to mention the criticism from Log Cabin Republicans, using terms like support, equality, and liberty. I should ensure that the summary flows logically and stays within 200 words. 

I should avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented, making sure the moral framing is preserved. Let me piece this together, making sure each key point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has released a campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives, contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end what he calls "Obama’s war on religion." The ad highlights Perry’s criticism of overturning the "don’t ask, don’t tell" policy, stating, "I’m not ashamed to admit that I’m a Christian," while questioning why gays can serve openly in the military but kids can’t celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry’s multimillion-dollar ad budget focuses on Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers identify as Christian evangelicals. The ad follows Perry’s criticism of the Obama administration’s global promotion of gay rights. He also pledges to fight liberal attacks on religious heritage, claiming faith made America strong. However, the ad has been denounced by Log Cabin Republicans, who argue it’s wrong to assume being a person of faith precludes supporting equality. They emphasize that open service by gay and lesbian servicemembers aligns with liberty and responsibility, core values of the founding fathers.  
END OF SUMMARY.
