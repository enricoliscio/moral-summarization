SUMMARY: 
In a blatant appeal to hard-right conservatives, Texas Gov. Rick Perry released a campaign ad that uses Christianity as a weapon against homosexuality. Perry vows to end "Obama's war on religion" and criticizes the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell," claiming that it is wrong that gays can serve openly in the military while children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad, likely targeted at Christian evangelicals in Iowa, has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans as an attack on equality and individual liberty. They argue that the governor is wrong to assume that faith and support for equality are mutually exclusive. Perry's ad claims that faith made America strong, and it can do so again, framing his campaign as a moral crusade against what he sees as liberal attacks on the country's religious heritage.
