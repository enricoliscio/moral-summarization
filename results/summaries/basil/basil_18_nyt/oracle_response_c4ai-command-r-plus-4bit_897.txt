SUMMARY: In a new campaign ad, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas appeals to hard-right conservatives by contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and criticizing the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell." Perry vows to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion," claiming that it is wrong that gays can serve openly in the military but children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad, likely targeted at Christian evangelicals in Iowa, also highlights Perry's criticism of the Obama administration's efforts to promote gay rights globally. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, who argue that supporting equality and individual liberty is in line with the values of the founding fathers. Perry's stance on religion and homosexuality has sparked debate, with some seeing it as an appeal to conservative values, while others view it as an attack on religious freedom and individual rights.
