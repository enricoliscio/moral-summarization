SUMMARY: In a bid to appeal to hard-right conservatives, Texas Governor Rick Perry releases a new campaign ad that appears to contrast Christianity with homosexuality. The ad, which will air in Iowa, home to many Christian evangelical Republican caucusgoers, features Perry vowing to end "Obama's war on religion" and criticizing the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell." Perry claims that there is something wrong when gays can serve openly in the military but children cannot celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad was denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, who argued that being a person of faith does not preclude one from supporting equality. They criticized Perry for seeking to be a "theocrat-in-chief" rather than a commander-in-chief.

END OF SUMMARY.
