SUMMARY: In a new campaign ad, Texas Gov. Rick Perry appeals to hard-right conservatives by contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." Perry criticizes the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell" and suggests that it is wrong that gays can serve openly in the military while children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad is aimed at Christian evangelicals in Iowa, a key voting bloc in the upcoming caucuses. Perry's stance has been criticized by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, who argue that supporting equality is compatible with being a person of faith. They also emphasize the importance of individual liberty and responsibility in line with the nation's founding principles.

END OF SUMMARY.
