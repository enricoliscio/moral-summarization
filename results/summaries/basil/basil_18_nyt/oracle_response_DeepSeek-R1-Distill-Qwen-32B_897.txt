Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Gov. Rick Perry's campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives. He contrasts Christianity with homosexuality, criticizes Obama's policies on religion and military service, and emphasizes his Christian identity. The ad also mentions his stance against the end of "don't ask, don't tell" and his opposition to Obama's promotion of gay rights globally. There's criticism from Log Cabin Republicans, who argue against his stance on equality and religious freedom.

I should identify the key points: Perry's ad, the contrast between Christianity and homosexuality, his criticism of Obama's policies, the targeting of Christian evangelicals in Iowa, and the opposition from the LGBTQ+ group. I need to use the provided moral words: contrast, war, admit, celebrate, pray, end, fight, attacks, strong, being, support, equality, liberty.

I'll structure the summary to include these words, ensuring it's concise and under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the ad's purpose, then the contrast, Perry's statements about Christianity and the military, his vows to end the "war on religion," and the opposition. I'll make sure to include the moral framing elements without adding any personal opinions.

SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has released a campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives, contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end what he calls "Obama’s war on religion." The ad emphasizes Perry’s Christian identity and criticizes the overturning of the "don’t ask, don’t tell" policy, stating that it’s wrong when gays can serve openly in the military but kids can’t celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad is part of Perry’s multimillion-dollar television budget, focusing on Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers are Christian evangelicals. Perry also opposes Obama’s promotion of gay rights globally, asserting he’ll fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage, claiming faith made America strong. The ad has been denounced by Log Cabin Republicans, who argue Perry’s assumption that being a person of faith precludes supporting equality is wrong. They emphasize the U.S. was built on liberty and individual responsibility, with LGBTQ+ military service aligning with the founding fathers’ vision. END OF SUMMARY.
