SUMMARY: In a new campaign ad, Texas Gov. Rick Perry appeals to hard-right conservatives by contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." Perry, who is not afraid to admit his Christian faith, criticizes the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell" and claims that it is wrong that gays can serve openly in the military while children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry pledges to fight against "liberal attacks" on America's religious heritage and to make the country strong again through faith. His ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, who argue that being a person of faith does not preclude one from supporting equality. They assert that open service by gay and lesbian service members is in line with the values of individual liberty and responsibility upon which the nation was founded. The ad is aimed at Christian evangelicals, particularly in Iowa, where Perry has been focusing his multimillion-dollar television budget.
