SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has released a new campaign ad that appeals to hard-right conservatives, contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." The ad highlights Perry's criticism of allowing gays to serve openly in the military and his stance against promoting gay rights globally. Perry claims that faith made America strong and can do so again, implying that religious values are under attack. However, the ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay men and lesbian group, who argue that being a person of faith does not mean one cannot support equality. They emphasize that individual liberty and responsibility are core American values, and that open service by gay and lesbian servicemembers aligns with the vision of the founding fathers. The ad's message is divisive and exclusionary, implying that certain groups are not entitled to the same rights and freedoms as others.

END OF SUMMARY.
