SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has released a new campaign ad that appeals to hard-right conservatives by contrasting Christianity with homosexuality. The ad vows to end what Perry calls "Obama's war on religion" and highlights his criticism of overturning the "don't ask, don't tell" policy for gays serving in the military. Perry claims that it's wrong that gays can serve openly in the military while children can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad is part of Perry's multimillion-dollar television budget, targeting Iowa's Christian evangelicals. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay men and lesbian group, which argues that being a person of faith does not mean one cannot support equality. The group emphasizes that individual liberty and responsibility are core American values, and open service by gay and lesbian servicemembers aligns with the vision of the founding fathers.
