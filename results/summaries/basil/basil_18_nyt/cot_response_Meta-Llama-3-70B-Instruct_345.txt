SUMMARY:
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has released a new campaign ad that appeals to hard-right conservatives, contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." Perry, who is not ashamed to admit he's a Christian, criticizes the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell" and claims that there's something wrong in the country when gays can serve openly in the military but kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He promises to fight against liberal attacks on religious heritage, stating that faith made America strong and can make it strong again. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, who argue that being a person of faith does not mean one cannot support equality and that open service by gay and lesbian servicemembers is in line with the vision of the founding fathers.
