SUMMARY: 
In a new campaign ad, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas appeals to hard-right conservatives by contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end "Obama's war on religion." Perry criticizes the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell," claiming that it is *wrong* that gays can serve openly in the military while children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He pledges to fight against *liberal attacks* on America's *religious heritage* and asserts that *faith* can make the country strong again. Perry's ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, who argue that supporting *equality* is in line with our nation's founding principles of *liberty* and *responsibility*. They criticize Perry for assuming that being a person of *faith* precludes one from supporting gay rights. The ad is targeted at Christian evangelicals in Iowa, where Perry has focused much of his television campaign budget.
