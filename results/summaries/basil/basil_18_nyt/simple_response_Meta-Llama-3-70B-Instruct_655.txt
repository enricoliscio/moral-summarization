SUMMARY:

Governor Rick Perry of Texas has released a campaign ad that appeals to hard-right conservatives, contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." The ad highlights Perry's criticism of overturning the "don't ask, don't tell" policy for gays serving in the military and suggests that allowing gays to serve openly is incompatible with celebrating Christmas or praying in school. The ad is seen as a ploy to appeal to Christian evangelicals in Iowa, a key demographic in the Republican caucuses. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group, which argues that being a person of faith does not preclude supporting equality. The group's executive director, R. Clarke Cooper, criticized Perry's stance, saying it is at odds with the nation's founding principles of individual liberty and responsibility.
