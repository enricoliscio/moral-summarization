SUMMARY:

Governor Rick Perry of Texas has released a new campaign ad that contrasts Christianity with homosexuality, vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." In the ad, Perry admits to being a Christian and criticizes the overturning of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy for gays serving in the military. He argues that it's wrong that gays can serve openly in the military, but children can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry's ad is a clear appeal to hard-right conservatives, particularly in Iowa, where many Republican caucusgoers identify as Christian evangelicals. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay men and lesbian group, who argue that being a person of faith does not mean one cannot support equality. Perry's rhetoric is strong, using words like "fight" and "attacks" to describe his stance against liberal forces. Ultimately, Perry's ad is a call to action, urging viewers to stand up for their religious heritage and individual liberty.
