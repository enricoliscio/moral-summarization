Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Governor Rick Perry's campaign ad. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. 

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The ad targets hard-right conservatives, contrasting Christianity with homosexuality. It criticizes Obama's policies, especially the end of "don't ask, don't tell" and the promotion of gay rights. Perry emphasizes his Christian values and attacks on religious freedom.

I need to highlight the moral arguments on both sides. Perry's ad is seen as promoting religious values against gay rights. The Log Cabin Republicans counter that this is wrong, supporting equality and individual liberty.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the essence of the moral debate without adding personal opinions. I'll structure it to mention Perry's ad, its content, the target audience, and the opposing viewpoints.

Let me draft it, making sure to include all key elements and keep it within the word limit. I'll check that the moral framing is clear and that both perspectives are represented.

SUMMARY: Texas Governor Rick Perry has released a campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives, emphasizing his Christian values and criticizing President Obama's policies on religion and gay rights. The ad contrasts Christianity with homosexuality, condemns the overturning of the "don’t ask, don’t tell" policy, and accuses the Obama administration of waging a "war on religion." Perry vows to protect religious heritage and opposes liberal attacks on faith, arguing that "faith made America strong." The ad has drawn criticism from Log Cabin Republicans, who argue that supporting equality and individual liberty aligns with American values and the vision of the founding fathers. They denounce Perry's attempt to equate religious faith with opposition to gay rights, calling it "wrong" and urging him to focus on national leadership rather than theocratic governance. END OF SUMMARY.
