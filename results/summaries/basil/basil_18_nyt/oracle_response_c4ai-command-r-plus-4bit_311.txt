SUMMARY: In a new campaign ad, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas appeals to hard-right conservatives by contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." Perry claims that there is something wrong with gays serving openly in the military while children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. He promises to fight against "liberal attacks" on America's "religious heritage" and states that faith can make the country strong again. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, who argue that supporting equality and individual liberty is in line with the values of the founding fathers. Perry's focus on Christian evangelicals in Iowa and his criticism of the overturning of "don't ask, don't tell" highlight his strategy to gain support from this key demographic.
