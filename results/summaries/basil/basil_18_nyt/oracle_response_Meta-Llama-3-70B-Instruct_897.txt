SUMMARY:

Governor Rick Perry of Texas has released a new campaign ad that contrasts Christianity with homosexuality, vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion". In the ad, Perry admits to being a Christian and criticizes the overturning of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy for gays serving in the military. He argues that it's wrong that gays can serve openly in the military, but children can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Perry promises to fight against liberal attacks on America's religious heritage, which he believes made America strong. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay men and lesbian group, who argue that being a person of faith does not mean one cannot support equality. They claim that open service by gay and lesbian servicemembers is in line with the vision of America's founding fathers, who valued individual liberty and responsibility.
