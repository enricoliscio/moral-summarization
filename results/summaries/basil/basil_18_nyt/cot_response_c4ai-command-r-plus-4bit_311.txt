SUMMARY: 
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas released a new campaign ad targeting hard-right conservatives that appears to contrast Christianity with homosexuality. In the ad, Perry vows to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion" and criticizes the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell," suggesting that it is *wrong* for gays to serve openly in the military while *kids* cannot openly *celebrate Christmas* or *pray* in school. The ad highlights Perry's appeal to Christian evangelicals in Iowa, a key voting bloc in the upcoming caucuses. The ad has been *denounced* by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, who argue that supporting equality and being a person of *faith* are not mutually exclusive. They also emphasize that open service by gay and lesbian service members aligns with the principles of *liberty* and *individual responsibility* envisioned by the founding fathers. Perry's ad makes a moral appeal to *religious heritage*, claiming that *faith made America strong* and can do so again.
END OF SUMMARY.
