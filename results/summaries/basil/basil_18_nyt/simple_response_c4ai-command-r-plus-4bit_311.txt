SUMMARY: In a new campaign ad, Texas Gov. Rick Perry appeals to hard-right conservatives by contrasting Christianity with homosexuality and vowing to end what he calls "Obama's war on religion." Perry, who is not afraid to admit his Christian faith, criticizes the overturning of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy, suggesting that it is wrong that gays can serve openly in the military while children cannot openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. The ad, aimed at Christian evangelicals in Iowa, also criticizes the Obama administration's efforts to promote gay rights globally. The ad has been denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian group, who argue that supporting equality is compatible with faith. They criticize Perry for aspiring to be a "theocrat-in-chief" rather than a commander-in-chief. Perry's stance on religion and homosexuality highlights a moral conflict between conservative Christians and those advocating for LGBT rights and separation of church and state.
