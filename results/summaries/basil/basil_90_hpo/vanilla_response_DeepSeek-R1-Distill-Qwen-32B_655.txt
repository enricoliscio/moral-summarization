Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Nancy Pelosi's reaction to Rashida Tlaib's comment. Let me read through the article carefully. 

The article starts by mentioning that Nancy Pelosi isn't upset about Tlaib's vulgar comment about impeaching Trump. Tlaib used the phrase "impeach that motherfucker" during an event. Pelosi refers to this as a free speech issue and says she doesn't censor her colleagues. She mentions that while she doesn't like the language, she doesn't think it's worse than what Trump has said, like his comments about women and "shithole countries." 

Tlaib, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, made the comment at a MoveOn event, and the crowd cheered. Pelosi thinks the comment might energize Trump's base but doesn't affect House business. She emphasizes it's about individual freedom of speech, not the Democratic caucus. Trump responded on Twitter, saying they want to impeach him because they can't win in 2020.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Pelosi's stance on free speech, Tlaib's comment, Pelosi's comparison to Trump's remarks, Tlaib's background, the crowd's reaction, Pelosi's view on its impact, and Trump's response.

Let me structure it: start with Pelosi's reaction, mention Tlaib's comment, her position on free speech, compare to Trump's language, Tlaib's event and crowd reaction, Pelosi's thoughts on the impact, and Trump's Twitter response. Keep it concise, making sure each point is clear without going into too much detail.

I should also make sure to include the key elements: Pelosi's generational perspective, her not censoring, the comparison to Trump's comments, Tlaib's role, the cheering, the impact on House business, and Trump's response. 

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows well.
