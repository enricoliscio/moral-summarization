SUMMARY:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's vulgar comment about impeaching President Donald Trump, calling it a free speech issue. Tlaib, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, said "we're gonna impeach the motherfucker" at an event hosted by MoveOn. Pelosi, while disapproving of the language, noted that Trump has made similar comments in the past. She believes Tlaib's comment won't impact House business, but may fire up Trump's base. Pelosi emphasized that the Democratic caucus doesn't condone the language, but respects individual members' freedom of speech. Trump responded on Twitter, claiming that Democrats want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020.

END OF SUMMARY.
