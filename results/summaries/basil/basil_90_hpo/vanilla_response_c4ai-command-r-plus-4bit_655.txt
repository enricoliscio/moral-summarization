SUMMARY: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi addressed Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's recent comments about impeaching President Donald Trump, stating that while she doesn't condone the language used, she respects free speech. Pelosi acknowledged a generational difference in her reaction to the comment but emphasized that she doesn't believe Tlaib's words were worse than some of Trump's own controversial statements. She also noted that Tlaib's comment doesn't impact House business and that any controversy surrounding it is about an individual member's freedom of speech. Pelosi's comments came in response to Tlaib's vow to "impeach the motherfucker," referring to Trump, which she made shortly after being sworn in as one of the first Muslim women in Congress. Trump responded to Tlaib's comment on Twitter, attributing impeachment efforts to the Democrats' fear of losing in 2020.
END OF SUMMARY.
