SUMMARY:
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's "vulgar" comment on impeaching President Donald Trump, calling it a "free speech" issue. Tlaib had vowed to "impeach that motherfucker" during a speech, using language that Pelosi acknowledged she wouldn't use herself. However, Pelosi noted that Trump's own comments, such as bragging about grabbing women "by the pussy" and referring to certain nations as "shithole countries," have had a greater impact on people's lives. Pelosi reasoned that Tlaib's comment might fire up Trump's base, but it doesn't affect the actual House business. Trump responded on Twitter, claiming that Democrats only want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020. The controversy surrounding Tlaib's comment ultimately concerns the "freedom of speech of an individual member," Pelosi said. END OF SUMMARY.
