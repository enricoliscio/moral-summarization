SUMMARY: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded to Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's controversial comment about impeaching President Trump, saying she was not upset by the "colorful language" and that it was a free speech issue. Pelosi acknowledged a generational difference in her reaction but stated she is not in the censorship business. She drew a contrast between Tlaib's language and Trump's offensive remarks, arguing that the president's words have more impact. Pelosi also noted that Tlaib's comment was a personal statement and not the stance of the Democratic caucus. Trump responded to Tlaib's comment on Twitter, attributing impeachment efforts to the Democrats' lack of confidence in winning the 2020 election.

END OF SUMMARY.
