SUMMARY: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has addressed Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's recent use of vulgar language in reference to impeaching President Donald Trump, stating that while she doesn't approve of the language used, it is a free speech issue and not something she will censor. Pelosi drew a moral distinction between Tlaib's comment and Trump's past comments, arguing that the president's words carry more weight and have the potential to impact people's lives negatively. She also acknowledged the generational aspect of her reaction, showing respect for freedom of expression despite her personal discomfort with the language used. Pelosi emphasized that the comment does not reflect the stance of the Democratic caucus and that any controversy surrounding it should be viewed as an individual's exercise of free speech. Trump responded to Tlaib's comment on Twitter, seemingly dismissing the impeachment threat.

END OF SUMMARY.
