SUMMARY:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's controversial comment about impeaching President Donald Trump, saying it's a free speech issue. Tlaib, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, used vulgar language, vowing to "impeach that motherfucker" during an event. Pelosi, while not condoning the language, noted that Trump has made similar comments in the past, such as bragging about grabbing women and referring to certain nations as "shithole countries". Pelosi believes Tlaib's comment won't impact House business, but might fire up Trump's base. Trump responded on Twitter, claiming Democrats want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020.

END OF SUMMARY.
