Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully first.

The article is about Nancy Pelosi's reaction to Rashida Tlaib's vulgar comment regarding impeaching Trump. Tlaib used the phrase "impeach that motherfucker" during a speech, and Pelosi responded by saying it's a free speech issue, not something she wants to censor. She also compared it to Trump's own vulgar remarks, like his "grab them by the pussy" comment and calling countries "shithole." Pelosi mentioned that Trump's words can impact people's lives more than Tlaib's, so it's not as bad.

Now, the user wants a summary that's under 200 words, using the "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, I need to keep the moral framing as the author presented it. So, I should highlight Pelosi's stance on free speech and her comparison to Trump's comments, showing that she's not censoring but also acknowledging the difference in impact.

I should make sure to include the key points: Tlaib's comment, Pelosi's response, the comparison to Trump, and the implications on free speech and political impact. I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the main ideas without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: Start with Tlaib's comment, then Pelosi's reaction, her generational perspective, the comparison to Trump, and the impact aspect. Then mention Trump's tweet in response. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

I think that covers all the necessary parts while maintaining the moral elements presented in the article. I'll make sure the summary flows logically and sticks to the facts without adding any personal opinions.

SUMMARY: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's use of vulgar language when referring to impeaching President Trump, calling it a free speech issue. Tlaib, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, used the phrase "impeach that motherfucker" during a speech, drawing attention to her strong stance against Trump. Pelosi stated she doesn't censor colleagues and noted that while she disapproves of the language, it's no worse than Trump's own remarks, such as his infamous "grab them by the pussy" comment or calling countries "shithole." Pelosi emphasized that Trump's words can impact people's lives more significantly. She also dismissed the idea that Tlaib's comment would affect House business, framing it as an individual's free speech issue rather than a caucus stance. Trump responded on Twitter, claiming Democrats want to impeach him because they can't win in 2020. END OF SUMMARY.
