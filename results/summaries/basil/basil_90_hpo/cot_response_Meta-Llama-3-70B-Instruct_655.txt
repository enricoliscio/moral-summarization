SUMMARY:
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has no issue with Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's "vulgar" comment on impeaching President Donald Trump, citing it as a "free speech" issue. Pelosi, while not condoning the "colorful language," noted that it's not her place to censor her colleagues. She drew parallels between Tlaib's comment and Trump's own "infamously" controversial remarks, including his boasts about grabbing women and referring to certain nations as "shithole countries." Pelosi reasoned that while Trump's comments have the power to "impact people's lives," Tlaib's do not. Tlaib's comment, in which she vowed to "impeach the motherfucker," was met with cheers from her supporters, with Pelosi suggesting it might "fire up" Trump's base. Trump responded on Twitter, claiming that Democrats only want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020.
END OF SUMMARY.
