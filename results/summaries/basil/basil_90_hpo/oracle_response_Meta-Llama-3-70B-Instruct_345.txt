SUMMARY:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's vulgar comment about impeaching President Donald Trump, citing it as a "free speech" issue. Pelosi acknowledged that she doesn't like Tlaib's "colorful language," but refused to censor her colleague. The House speaker noted that Trump's own comments, such as his infamous "grab them by the pussy" remark and references to certain nations as "shithole countries," have had a greater impact on people's lives. Pelosi argued that Tlaib's comment, though controversial, doesn't affect actual House business. Trump responded to Tlaib's comment on Twitter, claiming that Democrats only want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020. The incident highlights the "freedom of speech" of individual members, rather than the stance of the Democratic caucus. Pelosi's stance emphasizes the importance of protecting individual expression, even when it involves "leaked" or "referred" insults.

END OF SUMMARY.
