SUMMARY: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is brushing off newly sworn-in Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s use of an expletive in calling for President Donald Trump’s impeachment, calling it a “freedom of speech” issue. Pelosi told MSNBC’s Joy Reid that while she doesn’t condone Tlaib’s language, it’s no worse than the president’s own well-documented use of vulgarity and insults. She noted that Trump has referred to certain nations as “shithole countries” and was caught on tape bragging about grabbing women “by the pussy.” Pelosi suggested that Tlaib’s comment, while controversial, won’t impact House business and is a matter for the individual member, not the Democratic caucus as a whole. Trump responded to Tlaib’s comments on Twitter, claiming Democrats only want to impeach him because they can’t win in 2020.
END OF SUMMARY.
