Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Nancy Pelosi's reaction to Rashida Tlaib's comment. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing words: leaked, referred, insults, expletive, freedom. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Pelosi isn't upset about Tlaib's vulgar comment, referring to impeaching Trump. She mentions it's a free speech issue. She doesn't like the language but doesn't censor her colleagues. She compares it to Trump's comments, which have real impact. Tlaib used the expletive at a MoveOn event, and Pelosi thinks it won't affect House business much. Trump responded on Twitter about impeachment being due to election fears.

Now, I need to include the moral words. I'll make sure to use'referred' when talking about Tlaib's comment. 'Insults' can be used when mentioning Trump's past remarks. 'Expletive' is used to describe Tlaib's language. 'Freedom' relates to Pelosi's stance on free speech. 'Leaked' was used in the original article about Trump's tape, so I should include that context.

I should structure the summary to flow logically: Pelosi's reaction, the context of Tlaib's comment, the comparison to Trump's language, and the implications of free speech. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure all the moral words are included naturally.

SUMMARY: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has dismissed concerns over Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s use of vulgar language when referring to impeaching President Donald Trump, calling it a free speech issue. Tlaib, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, used the expletive "motherfucker" while speaking to supporters at a MoveOn event, stating, "we’re gonna go in there, and we’re gonna impeach the motherfucker." Pelosi noted she doesn’t like the language but emphasized she’s not in the "censorship business," adding that Tlaib’s comments aren’t worse than Trump’s own insults, such as his infamous remarks about grabbing women "by the pussy" or calling certain nations "shithole countries." Pelosi reasoned that while Trump’s comments can impact people’s lives, Tlaib’s remarks don’t significantly affect House business. Trump responded on Twitter, claiming the impeachment push stems from Democrats’ fears of losing in 2020. The incident highlights the tension between freedom of speech and the impact of inflammatory language in political discourse. END OF SUMMARY.
