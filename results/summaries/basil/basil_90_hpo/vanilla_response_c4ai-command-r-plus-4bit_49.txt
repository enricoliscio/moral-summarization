SUMMARY: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded to Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's use of vulgar language in reference to impeaching President Trump, stating that while she doesn't condone the language, it's a free speech issue and not something she will censor. Pelosi acknowledged a generational difference in reaction to the language and drew a contrast with Trump's own controversial remarks, arguing that his comments have a greater impact on people's lives. Tlaib's comment, made shortly after her swearing-in ceremony, sparked controversy and criticism from Trump supporters. Pelosi downplayed the significance of the comment, stating that it doesn't reflect the stance of the Democratic caucus and that it wouldn't affect House business. Trump responded on Twitter, accusing Democrats of only seeking impeachment due to their perceived inability to win the 2020 election.
END OF SUMMARY.
