Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a specific structure for the response, so I should follow that closely. 

First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the text. These are words that carry a moral judgment or implication. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "vulgar," "impeaching," "colorful language," "motherfucker," "censorship," "freedom of speech," "generational," "language," "impact," "bullies," "cheers," "controversy," "stance," and "success." These words seem to carry moral connotations in the context of the article.

Next, I have to write a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary needs to be concise, no longer than 200 words. I should ensure that the summary reflects the moral perspectives presented in the original article, such as Pelosi's stance on free speech versus the vulgar language used by Tlaib, and the comparison to Trump's comments.

I'll start by outlining the main points: Pelosi's reaction to Tlaib's comment, the comparison to Trump's language, the implications of free speech, and the political response from Trump. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words naturally within the summary.

I should also keep the summary clear and to the point, ensuring it captures the essence of the article without unnecessary details. I'll need to balance between including the moral terms and maintaining a coherent flow.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it meets the word limit and accurately represents the moral framing from the original text. I'll check that all the key points are covered and that the summary flows logically from one point to the next.

**SUMMARY:**  
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi addressed Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s vulgar comment about impeaching President Donald Trump, calling it a free speech issue. Pelosi stated she doesn’t censor her colleagues, though she personally disapproves of the language. She compared Tlaib’s remarks to Trump’s own vulgar comments, noting that while Trump’s words can impact people’s lives, Tlaib’s do not. Tlaib, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, used the expletive during a victory speech, sparking cheers from supporters. Pelosi emphasized that the controversy revolves around individual members’ freedom of speech, not the Democratic caucus’s stance. Trump responded on Twitter, accusing Democrats of impeachment attempts due to their inability to win in 2020.
