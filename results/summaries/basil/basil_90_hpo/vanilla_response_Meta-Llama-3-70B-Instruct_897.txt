SUMMARY:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has downplayed the controversy surrounding Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's vulgar comment about impeaching President Donald Trump. Pelosi said it's a free speech issue and that she's not in the censorship business. While she doesn't like the language used by Tlaib, she notes that Trump has made similar comments in the past. Pelosi believes that Tlaib's comment won't have a significant impact on House business, but it might fire up Trump's base. Trump responded to Tlaib's comment on Twitter, claiming that Democrats only want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020.

Pelosi's comments came during an MSNBC town hall interview, where she emphasized that she doesn't tell her colleagues what to say. Tlaib's comment was made at an event hosted by the progressive group MoveOn, where she vowed to "impeach that motherfucker" in reference to Trump.

END OF SUMMARY.
