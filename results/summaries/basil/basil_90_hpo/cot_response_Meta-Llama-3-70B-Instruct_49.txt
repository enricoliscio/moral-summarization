SUMMARY:
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's vulgar comment on impeaching President Donald Trump, calling it a free speech issue. Pelosi acknowledged that she didn't like Tlaib's "colorful language," but wouldn't censor her. She noted that Trump has infamously made worse comments, such as bragging about grabbing women and referring to certain nations as "shithole countries." Pelosi argued that while Trump's comments have the power to impact people's lives, Tlaib's comment does not. Trump responded on Twitter, claiming that Democrats only want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020. Pelosi downplayed the controversy, saying it concerns the "freedom of speech of an individual member," not the stance of the Democratic caucus. END OF SUMMARY.
