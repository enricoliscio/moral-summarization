Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The author used words like "leaked," "referred," "insults," "expletive," and "freedom." I should make sure to include these terms in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Rep. Rashida Tlaib making a vulgar comment about impeaching Trump, and Pelosi's reaction. Pelosi supports free speech and doesn't censor her colleagues, even though she doesn't like the language. She compares it to Trump's own vulgar comments.

I need to include the morally framed words. So, I'll mention the "leaked" tape where Trump made inappropriate comments. Tlaib "referred" to Trump with an "expletive." Pelosi addresses the "insults" Trump has made. She emphasizes "freedom of speech."

I should structure the summary to include these points concisely. Make sure it's under 200 words. I'll start by stating Tlaib's comment and Pelosi's response, then mention the comparison to Trump's language, and end with Pelosi's stance on free speech.

Let me draft it:

Rep. Rashida Tlaib used an expletive when vowing to impeach Trump, referring to him in vulgar terms. Pelosi defended this as a free speech issue, noting her generational perspective but not supporting censorship. She dislikes the language but compares it to Trump's own insults, like the leaked tape where he bragged about grabbing women. Pelosi argues that while Trump's words impact lives, Tlaib's don't affect House business much. She emphasizes individual freedom of speech, not the party's stance. Trump responded on Twitter, accusing Democrats of impeachment due to 2020 fears.

That's concise and includes all the moral terms. Let me check the word count. It's within 200 words. I think this captures the essence while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s use of vulgar language when vowing to “impeach that motherfucker” in reference to President Donald Trump, calling it a free speech issue. Pelosi stated she doesn’t censor her colleagues and while she doesn’t like the language, she compared it to Trump’s own insults, such as his leaked remarks about grabbing women “by the pussy” and calling certain countries “shithole countries.” Pelosi reasoned that Trump’s comments have the power to impact people’s lives, while Tlaib’s do not. Tlaib, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, made the expletive remark during a victory speech, drawing cheers from the crowd. Pelosi emphasized that the controversy over Tlaib’s comment pertains to the freedom of speech of an individual member, not the Democratic caucus. Trump responded on Twitter, accusing Democrats of impeachment motives tied to their fears of losing in 2020.  
END OF SUMMARY.
