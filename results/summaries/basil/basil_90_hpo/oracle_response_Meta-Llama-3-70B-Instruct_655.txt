SUMMARY:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has taken a neutral stance on Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's vulgar comment about impeaching President Donald Trump, citing it as a "free speech" issue. Pelosi acknowledged that she doesn't like the language used by Tlaib, but refused to censor her, drawing a comparison to Trump's own controversial comments, including a "leaked" tape where he bragged about grabbing women and his frequent use of "insults" against political foes. Pelosi reasoned that while Trump's comments have the power to "impact people's lives," Tlaib's comment does not. The House Speaker also noted that the controversy surrounding Tlaib's comment concerns the "freedom of speech" of an individual member, not the stance of the Democratic caucus. Trump responded to Tlaib's comment on Twitter, claiming that Democrats only want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020.

END OF SUMMARY.
