SUMMARY:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has taken a neutral stance on Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's vulgar comment about impeaching President Donald Trump, citing it as a "free speech" issue. Pelosi acknowledged that she doesn't like Tlaib's language, but refused to censor her, noting that Trump's own comments have had a greater impact on people's lives. Tlaib's comment, which included an expletive, was made at an event hosted by the progressive group MoveOn, where she vowed to "impeach the motherfucker." Pelosi reasoned that while Trump's leaked tape from 2005, where he bragged about grabbing women, and his subsequent insults towards political foes have been harmful, Tlaib's comment does not have the same power to affect people's lives. Trump responded to Tlaib's comment on Twitter, claiming that Democrats only want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020. Pelosi emphasized that the controversy surrounding Tlaib's comment concerns the "freedom of speech of an individual member," not the stance of the Democratic caucus.

END OF SUMMARY.
