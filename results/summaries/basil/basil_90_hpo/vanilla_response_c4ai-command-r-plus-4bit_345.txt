SUMMARY: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded to Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's use of vulgar language in reference to impeaching President Trump, saying that while she doesn't condone the language, it's a free speech issue and not something she will censor. Pelosi drew a contrast between Tlaib's comments and Trump's past remarks, arguing that the president's words have a greater impact on people's lives. She also noted that the controversy surrounding Tlaib's comments is about an individual member's freedom of speech and not the stance of the Democratic caucus. Trump responded to Tlaib's comments on Twitter, suggesting that impeachment efforts are motivated by Democrats' fear of losing the 2020 election.

END OF SUMMARY.
