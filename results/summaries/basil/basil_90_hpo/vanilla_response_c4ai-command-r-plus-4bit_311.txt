SUMMARY: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded to Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's use of vulgar language in referring to impeaching President Trump, saying that while she doesn't condone the language, it's a free speech issue and not as bad as the president's own words. Pelosi noted that Trump's comments have a greater impact and that Tlaib's remarks don't represent the stance of the Democratic caucus. She also suggested that the controversy is overblown and won't affect actual House business. Trump responded to Tlaib's comment on Twitter, claiming Democrats only want to impeach him because they can't win in 2020. Tlaib's comment came during an event hosted by MoveOn shortly after she was sworn in as one of the first Muslim women in Congress.
END OF SUMMARY.
