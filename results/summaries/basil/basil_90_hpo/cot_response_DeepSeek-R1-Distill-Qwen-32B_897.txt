Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me specific steps to follow. First, I have to identify all the morally framed words in the text. Then, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

Let me start by reading through the article again to understand the context. It's about Nancy Pelosi's reaction to Rashida Tlaib's vulgar comment regarding impeaching Trump. Pelosi defends Tlaib's right to free speech, comparing it to Trump's own controversial remarks.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to find all the single words that carry moral connotations. I'll go through each sentence and pick out words that imply judgment or value.

Looking at the first paragraph, "vulgar" is definitely a moral term. Then, "impeaching" is more of an action but has moral implications. Pelosi's reaction is described as "colorful language," but "colorful" isn't inherently moral, so I might skip that. She "vowed" to impeach, which is a strong commitment, but "vowed" isn't moral. "Motherfucker" is vulgar, so that's already noted.

In the next paragraph, Pelosi says it's a "free speech" issue. That's a moral concept. She mentions a "generational reaction," which is more about perspective. She's "not in the censorship business," so "censorship" is a moral term. She "doesn’t like that language," so "language" is neutral, but "like" isn't moral. She "doesn’t tell her colleagues what to say," so "tell" isn't moral. She compares it to Trump's comments, which "impact people's lives," so "impact" is neutral, but "lives" isn't moral. 

Moving on, Tlaib is one of the "first Muslim women in Congress," which is a positive achievement. She uses the expletive while speaking to supporters, which is "cheers" from the crowd, not moral. Pelosi mentions it might "fire up Trump’s base," so "fire up" is neutral, but "base" isn't moral. She says it doesn't make a "difference" to House business, which is neutral. She refers to "freedom of speech" again, which is moral. Trump responds on Twitter, saying they "only want to impeach" him because they "can’t win" in 2020, which are accusations with moral implications.

Putting it all together, the morally framed words I identified are: vulgar, free speech, censorship, impact, freedom, impeach, motherfucker, success, base, difference, want, can’t win.

Wait, let me double-check. "Impact" was part of Pelosi's reasoning about Trump's comments affecting people's lives, so it's more about consequence than morality. Similarly, "difference" and "success" are more factual. Maybe I should reconsider. "Impact" could be seen as having moral weight because it affects people's lives, but it's more about effect than moral judgment. Similarly, "difference" is neutral. "Success" is positive but not inherently moral in this context.

So perhaps the more clearly morally framed words are: vulgar, free speech, censorship, impeach, motherfucker, success, base, want, can’t win.

Wait, "want" and "can’t win" are part of Trump's statement, which is a moral accusation against the Democrats. So they carry moral weight in the context.

I think I have a list now. I'll make sure each word is a single word and that they are indeed carrying moral connotations in the context.

**STEP 1:**

* vulgar
* free speech
* censorship
* impeach
* motherfucker
* success
* base
* want
* can’t win

**SUMMARY:**

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's use of vulgar language when referring to impeaching President Trump, calling it a free speech issue. Pelosi stated she doesn't censor her colleagues, though she personally disapproves of the language. She compared Tlaib's comment to Trump's own controversial remarks, noting his words can impact people's lives, while Tlaib's don't. Tlaib, a new Muslim congresswoman, made the remark during a victory speech, sparking cheers from supporters. Pelosi emphasized the freedom of speech for individual members, not the Democratic caucus. Trump responded on Twitter, accusing Democrats of wanting to impeach him because they can’t win in 2020. END OF SUMMARY.
