SUMMARY:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's controversial comment about impeaching President Donald Trump, saying it's a matter of free speech. Tlaib sparked outrage by vowing to "impeach that motherfucker" during a speech to supporters. While Pelosi acknowledged that she wouldn't use such language herself, she drew a moral equivalence between Tlaib's comment and Trump's own history of offensive remarks, including bragging about grabbing women and using derogatory terms for certain countries. Pelosi argued that Trump's comments have a greater impact on people's lives, whereas Tlaib's comment is merely a matter of individual freedom of speech. The controversy, Pelosi said, doesn't reflect the stance of the Democratic caucus, but rather the right of an individual member to express themselves. Trump responded on Twitter, claiming that Democrats only want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020.

END OF SUMMARY.
