Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Nancy Pelosi's reaction to Rashida Tlaib's vulgar comment about impeaching Trump. The author used words like "leaked," "referred," "insults," "expletive," and "freedom." I should make sure to include these terms in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Pelosi isn't upset about Tlaib's comment, considering it a free speech issue. She mentions generational differences and doesn't censor her colleagues. She compares it to Trump's own vulgar remarks, like grabbing women and calling countries "shithole." Tlaib used the expletive in a speech, and Pelosi thinks it might energize Trump's base but doesn't affect House business. Trump responded on Twitter, saying they only want to impeach him because they can't win in 2020.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the specified moral words. I'll start by mentioning Pelosi's reaction, the use of "leaked" regarding Trump's tape, "referred" to Trump, "insults," "expletive" in Tlaib's comment, and "freedom" of speech. I'll structure it to show Pelosi's stance and the context of Trump's own language.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, connecting Pelosi's comments to the broader context of Trump's remarks. I'll also include Tlaib's statement and Trump's Twitter response briefly. Keeping it concise but covering all necessary points while preserving the moral framing.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each moral word is included where appropriate. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Once done, I'll review to ensure all key elements are present and the moral words are accurately placed.

SUMMARY: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi addressed Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s use of vulgar language when referring to impeaching President Trump, stating it was a free speech issue. Pelosi, while disapproving of the language, emphasized she doesn’t censor colleagues, noting it wasn’t worse than Trump’s own insults, such as his leaked remarks about grabbing women and calling countries “shithole.” Tlaib used the expletive during a victory speech, saying they would “impeach the motherfucker.” Pelosi reasoned that while Trump’s comments impact people’s lives, Tlaib’s didn’t affect House business. Trump responded on Twitter, claiming the impeachment push stems from Democrats’ inability to win in 2020. END OF SUMMARY.
