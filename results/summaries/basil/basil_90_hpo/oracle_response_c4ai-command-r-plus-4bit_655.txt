SUMMARY: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi addressed Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's recent comment about impeaching President Donald Trump, saying that while she doesn't condone the "colorful language," she respects Tlaib's freedom of speech. Pelosi drew a moral contrast between Tlaib's comments and Trump's past use of insulting and vulgar language, including his leaked tape in which he bragged about assaulting women. Pelosi noted that Trump's words have a greater impact and are more morally reprehensible given their potential to harm others. She also pointed out that Tlaib's comments were not an official stance of the Democratic caucus and that any controversy surrounding them should be viewed as a free speech issue. Meanwhile, Trump responded to Tlaib's comments via Twitter, insinuating that impeachment efforts were merely a political tactic by his opponents.
END OF SUMMARY.
