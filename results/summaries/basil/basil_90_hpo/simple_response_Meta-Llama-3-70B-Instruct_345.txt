SUMMARY:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's controversial comment about impeaching President Donald Trump, citing freedom of speech. Tlaib vowed to "impeach that motherfucker" during a rally, sparking criticism. Pelosi, while disapproving of the language, drew parallels with Trump's own history of offensive remarks, including bragging about grabbing women and referring to certain nations as "shithole countries". Pelosi argued that Trump's comments have a greater impact on people's lives, whereas Tlaib's comment does not. The Speaker also downplayed the controversy, saying it doesn't affect House business and only concerns individual freedom of speech. Trump responded on Twitter, claiming Democrats want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020.

END OF SUMMARY.
