SUMMARY:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's controversial comment about impeaching President Donald Trump, saying it's a free speech issue. Tlaib had vowed to "impeach that motherfucker" during a speech to supporters, sparking outrage. Pelosi acknowledged that while she wouldn't use such language, she doesn't believe it's any worse than Trump's own inflammatory comments, such as bragging about grabbing women or insulting political foes. Pelosi argued that Trump's words have the power to harm people, whereas Tlaib's comment does not. The Speaker also noted that the controversy surrounding Tlaib's comment is about individual freedom of speech, not the stance of the Democratic caucus. Trump responded on Twitter, claiming that Democrats only want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020.

END OF SUMMARY.
