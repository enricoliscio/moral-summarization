Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Nancy Pelosi's reaction to Rashida Tlaib's comment about impeaching Trump. Tlaib used some strong language, calling Trump a "motherfucker." Pelosi said it's a free speech issue and doesn't censor her colleagues. She mentioned that Trump has used similar or worse language before. Tlaib is one of the first Muslim women in Congress, and her comment was made at a MoveOn event. Pelosi thinks the comment might energize Trump's base but doesn't affect House business. Trump responded on Twitter, saying they only want to impeach him because they can't win in 2020.

I should start by identifying the main points: Pelosi's stance on free speech, Tlaib's comment, comparison to Trump's language, Pelosi's view on its impact, and Trump's response. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on these key elements without too much detail. I'll make sure to mention Tlaib's background and the context of her comment. Also, include Pelosi's reasoning and Trump's reaction to round out the summary.

Let me structure it: Start with Pelosi's reaction, mention Tlaib's comment, her background, Pelosi's comparison to Trump, the impact she thinks it has, and end with Trump's response. That should cover all the essential parts concisely.

SUMMARY: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has addressed Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s use of vulgar language when discussing impeaching President Trump, calling it a free speech issue. Tlaib, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, used the expletive during a victory speech at a MoveOn event, saying, “we’re gonna go in there, and we’re gonna impeach the motherfucker.” Pelosi stated she doesn’t censor colleagues, though she personally dislikes such language. She compared it to Trump’s own controversial remarks, noting his comments can impact people’s lives, while Tlaib’s don’t. Pelosi believes the comment might energize Trump’s base but won’t affect House proceedings. Trump responded on Twitter, attributing the impeachment push to Democrats’ fear of losing in 2020. END OF SUMMARY.
