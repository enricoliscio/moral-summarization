SUMMARY:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's controversial comment about impeaching President Donald Trump, calling it a "free speech" issue. Tlaib vowed to "impeach that motherfucker" in a speech, using an expletive that sparked cheers from the crowd. Pelosi acknowledged that she personally dislikes the language, but refused to censor Tlaib, citing Trump's own history of insults and offensive comments, such as bragging about grabbing women "by the pussy" and referring to certain nations as "shithole countries". Pelosi argued that while Trump's comments have the power to "impact people's lives", Tlaib's comment does not. Trump responded on Twitter, claiming that Democrats only want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020. Pelosi downplayed the controversy, saying it concerns the "freedom of speech of an individual member", not the stance of the Democratic caucus.

END OF SUMMARY.
