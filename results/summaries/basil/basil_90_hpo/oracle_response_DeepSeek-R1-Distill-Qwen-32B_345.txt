Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Nancy Pelosi's reaction to Rashida Tlaib's comment about impeaching Trump. The user also specified that I should keep the morally framed words like "leaked," "referred," "insults," "expletive," and "freedom." 

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. Pelosi isn't upset about Tlaib's vulgar comment, referring to it as a free speech issue. She doesn't censor her colleagues and compares it to Trump's own comments, like grabbing women and calling countries "shithole." Tlaib used the expletive in a victory speech, and Pelosi thinks it might energize Trump's base but doesn't affect House business. Trump responded on Twitter, suggesting the impeachment is because they can't win in 2020.

Now, I need to craft a summary that's concise, under 200 words, and includes those moral words. I should make sure to mention Pelosi's stance on free speech, Tlaib's use of the expletive, Trump's leaked tape and insults, and the comparison Pelosi made. Also, include Trump's response.

I'll start by introducing Pelosi's reaction, then mention Tlaib's comment and the words used. Then, explain Pelosi's reasoning, referencing Trump's own language. Highlight the comparison between Tlaib's comment and Trump's impact. Finally, note Trump's Twitter response and Pelosi's view on it not affecting House business.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without being too lengthy. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within the limit. Also, make sure the morally framed words are included naturally in the context.

Let me structure it: Start with Pelosi's reaction, mention Tlaib's expletive, Pelosi's stance on free speech, comparison to Trump's language, the impact difference, Trump's response, and Pelosi's view on the controversy. That should cover all necessary points concisely.

SUMMARY: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed concerns over Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s vulgar comment about impeaching President Trump, calling it a free speech issue. Tlaib, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, used the expletive "motherfucker" while celebrating her victory, stating, "we’re gonna go in there, and we’re gonna impeach the motherfucker." Pelosi noted she doesn’t censor colleagues and compared Tlaib’s language to Trump’s own infamous remarks, such as bragging about grabbing women "by the pussy" and calling certain nations "shithole countries." While Trump’s comments can impact people’s lives, Pelosi argued Tlaib’s remark doesn’t hold the same weight. Trump responded on Twitter, claiming the impeachment push is due to Democrats’ inability to win in 2020. Pelosi emphasized the controversy revolves around the freedom of speech of individual members, not the Democratic caucus. END OF SUMMARY.
