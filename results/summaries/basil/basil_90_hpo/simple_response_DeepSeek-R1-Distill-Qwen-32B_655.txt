Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about Nancy Pelosi's reaction to Rashida Tlaib's vulgar comment during her swearing-in. Tlaib said she'd "impeach that motherfucker" referring to Trump. Pelosi mentions it's a free speech issue and doesn't censor her colleagues. She doesn't like the language but compares it to Trump's own vulgar comments. Trump responded on Twitter, saying they want to impeach him because they can't win in 2020.

I should focus on the moral aspects: free speech, comparison to Trump's language, and the political implications. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include Pelosi's stance, Tlaib's comment, and Trump's response. I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing by showing how Pelosi defends free speech but also contrasts it with Trump's impact on people's lives. Also, mention that the controversy is about individual speech, not the party's stance. Trump's response adds another layer of political tension.

I'll structure the summary to first state Tlaib's comment, then Pelosi's reaction, her comparison to Trump, the context of free speech, and finally Trump's tweet. Keep it clear and within the word limit. Make sure to end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s use of vulgar language when vowing to impeach President Donald Trump, calling it a free speech issue. Tlaib, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, used the expletive during a victory speech, saying, “we’re gonna go in there, and we’re gonna impeach the motherfucker.” Pelosi stated she doesn’t censor colleagues, though she personally disapproves of the language. She compared it to Trump’s own vulgar remarks, noting his comments can impact people’s lives, while Tlaib’s do not. Pelosi emphasized that the controversy centers on individual free speech, not the Democratic caucus’s stance. Trump responded on Twitter, claiming the impeachment push stems from Democrats’ inability to win in 2020. END OF SUMMARY.
