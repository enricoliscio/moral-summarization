Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Nancy Pelosi's reaction to Rashida Tlaib's comment. Let me read through the article first.

The article says that Pelosi isn't upset about Tlaib's vulgar comment about impeaching Trump. Tlaib used the phrase "impeach that motherfucker" during a speech. Pelosi mentioned it's a free speech issue and she doesn't censor her colleagues. She doesn't like the language but thinks it's not worse than what Trump has said before, like his "grab them by the pussy" remarks or calling countries "shithole." She also noted that Trump's comments can affect people's lives more than Tlaib's. Tlaib, a new Muslim congresswoman, made the comment at a MoveOn event, and the crowd cheered. Pelosi thinks it might energize Trump's base but doesn't affect House business. Trump responded on Twitter, saying they only want to impeach him because they can't win in 2020.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Pelosi's stance on free speech, the context of Tlaib's comment, Pelosi's comparison to Trump's remarks, and Trump's response. I'll make sure to mention Tlaib's background as a Muslim congresswoman and the crowd's reaction. Also, note Pelosi's point about the impact of Trump's comments versus Tlaib's.

Let me structure this: start with Pelosi's reaction, mention Tlaib's comment, Pelosi's free speech stance, comparison to Trump, Tlaib's background, crowd reaction, Pelosi's view on the impact, and Trump's response.

I should avoid any unnecessary details and keep it concise. Make sure the summary flows logically and covers all key points without being too wordy.
