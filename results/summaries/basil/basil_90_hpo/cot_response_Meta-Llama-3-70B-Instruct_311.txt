SUMMARY:
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's "vulgar" comment on impeaching President Donald Trump, calling it a "free speech" issue. Pelosi said she doesn't like the "colorful language" but wouldn't censor it, noting that Trump has made similar comments, such as bragging about grabbing women "by the pussy" and referring to certain nations as "shithole countries". Pelosi argued that Trump's comments have the power to "impact people's lives", whereas Tlaib's comment does not. Tlaib, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, made the comment at an event hosted by MoveOn, saying "we're gonna go in there, and we're gonna impeach the motherfucker". Trump responded on Twitter, claiming Democrats only want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020. Pelosi downplayed the controversy, saying it's about the "freedom of speech of an individual member", not the stance of the Democratic caucus. END OF SUMMARY.
