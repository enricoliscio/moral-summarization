SUMMARY:
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's "vulgar" comment on impeaching President Donald Trump, calling it a "free speech" issue. Tlaib vowed to "impeach that motherfucker" in a speech, which Pelosi acknowledged was not language she would use, but noted that Trump's own comments have been "infamously" offensive, including bragging about grabbing women and referring to certain nations as "shithole countries". Pelosi argued that while Trump's comments have the power to "impact people's lives", Tlaib's comments do not. The House Speaker also downplayed the controversy, saying it concerns the "freedom of speech of an individual member", not the stance of the Democratic caucus. Trump responded on Twitter, claiming that Democrats only want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020. END OF SUMMARY.
