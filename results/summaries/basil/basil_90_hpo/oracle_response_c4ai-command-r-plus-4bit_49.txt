SUMMARY: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is not upset by Representative Rashida Tlaib's use of vulgar language in calling for President Donald Trump's impeachment. Pelosi framed the issue as one of free speech, saying she wouldn't use such language herself but also wouldn't censor others. Pelosi drew a moral contrast between Tlaib's words and Trump's past comments, arguing that the president's leaked remarks about grabbing women and his insults toward other nations carry more weight and have a greater impact on people's lives. Tlaib's comment, an expletive-laden promise to "impeach the motherfucker," fired up Trump's base but had little effect on House business, Pelosi argued. She emphasized the freedom of speech of individual members, drawing a distinction between personal comments and the official stance of the Democratic caucus. Trump responded on Twitter, implying that impeachment efforts were driven by fear of his re-election.
END OF SUMMARY.
