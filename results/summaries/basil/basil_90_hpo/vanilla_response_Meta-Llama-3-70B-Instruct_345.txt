SUMMARY:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's vulgar comment about impeaching President Donald Trump, calling it a free speech issue. Tlaib had said "we're gonna impeach the motherfucker" during an event hosted by MoveOn. Pelosi stated that while she doesn't like the language, she wouldn't censor her colleagues and noted that Trump has made similar offensive comments in the past. Pelosi also downplayed the impact of Tlaib's comment, saying it wouldn't affect House business and might even fire up Trump's base. Trump responded to Tlaib's comment on Twitter, claiming that Democrats want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020. Pelosi's stance suggests that Democrats are not planning to take disciplinary action against Tlaib for her comment.

END OF SUMMARY.
