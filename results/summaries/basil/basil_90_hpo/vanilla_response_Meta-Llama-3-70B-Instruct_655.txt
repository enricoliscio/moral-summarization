SUMMARY:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has downplayed Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's vulgar comment about impeaching President Donald Trump, saying it's a free speech issue. Tlaib, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, vowed to "impeach that motherfucker" during an event hosted by MoveOn. Pelosi, in a town hall interview, said she doesn't like the language but wouldn't censor her colleagues. She noted that Trump has made similar controversial comments in the past. Pelosi believes Tlaib's comment might fire up Trump's base but won't affect House business. Trump responded to Tlaib on Twitter, claiming Democrats want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020.

END OF SUMMARY.
