SUMMARY:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has defended Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib's controversial comment about impeaching President Donald Trump, calling it a "free speech" issue. Tlaib had vowed to "impeach that motherfucker" in a speech, using an expletive that sparked cheers from the crowd. Pelosi, while disapproving of the language, drew parallels with Trump's own history of insults and leaked tapes, including his infamous bragging about grabbing women "by the pussy". Pelosi noted that Trump's comments have the power to "impact people's lives", whereas Tlaib's comments do not. Trump responded on Twitter, claiming that Democrats only want to impeach him because they know they can't win in 2020. Pelosi downplayed the controversy, saying it concerns the "freedom of speech of an individual member", not the stance of the Democratic caucus.

END OF SUMMARY.
