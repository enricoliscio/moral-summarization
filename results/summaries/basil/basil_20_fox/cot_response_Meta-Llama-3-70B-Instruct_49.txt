SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum clarified that his "phony theology" comment was not questioning President Obama's Christianity, but rather challenging his environmental policies that prioritize the Earth's welfare over human well-being. Santorum believes in being a good steward of the Earth, but not serving it, as he thinks "radical environmentalists" have it "upside down." The Obama campaign responded forcefully, calling the remark a "personal affront" and "wrong" and "destructive." They accused Santorum of fueling a Republican primary campaign with "distortions, ugliness, and searing pessimism and negativity." Santorum maintained that he was referring to a "world view that elevates the Earth above man," which he believes is not scientifically proven and an attempt to centralize power. The exchange highlights the "nasty" and "divisive" tone of the GOP primary. END OF SUMMARY.
