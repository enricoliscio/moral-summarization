Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum's comments on President Obama's policies. The user wants a concise summary, so I'll focus on the main points. 

First, Santorum criticized Obama's environmental policies, calling them a "phony theology." He clarified he wasn't questioning Obama's Christianity but rather his policies that prioritize the Earth over people. 

Next, the Obama campaign responded, calling his remarks an affront and urging a focus on policy debates instead of personal attacks. Santorum also tied the policies to government overreach, mentioning global warming as an example. 

I should make sure the summary is under 200 words, so I'll include the key points: Santorum's criticism, his clarification on Obama's faith, the campaign's response, and the mention of government power. I'll structure it clearly, starting with Santorum's statement, then the clarification, followed by the Obama campaign's reaction, and ending with Santorum's broader criticism. 

I need to keep it objective and avoid any personal opinions. Also, ensure it's within the word limit and properly formatted with the tokens. Let me draft it now, keeping each sentence focused and concise.

SUMMARY: Rick Santorum clarified that his recent criticism of President Obama's "phony theology" was not aimed at questioning Obama's Christianity but rather challenging policies that prioritize environmental stewardship over human welfare. Santorum argued that the idea of man serving the Earth is a flawed worldview, emphasizing that humans should use resources wisely without serving the planet. The Obama campaign strongly condemned Santorum's remarks, calling them a personal affront and urging a focus on policy debates rather than character attacks. Santorum also criticized the politicization of environmental issues, such as global warming, as attempts to centralize government power. While he reaffirmed Obama's Christian faith, he accused the president's worldview of being disconnected from most Americans' values. The Obama campaign accused the GOP primary of descending into negativity and divisiveness. END OF SUMMARY.
