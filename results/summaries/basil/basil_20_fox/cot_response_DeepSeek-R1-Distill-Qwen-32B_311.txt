Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Rick Santorum criticized President Obama's environmental policies, calling them "phony theology." He argued that Obama's approach puts the Earth's stewardship above people's welfare, which he sees as a radical environmentalist view. Santorum believes man should use Earth's resources wisely, not serve the Earth.

The article mentions that Santorum clarified he wasn't questioning Obama's Christianity but his policies. However, the Obama campaign responded strongly, saying his remarks were an affront and a distraction from policy debates. They emphasized the importance of discussing political positions without attacking character or faith.

I need to identify the morally framed words first. Let me go through the article again. Words like "phony theology," "radical environmentalist," "stewardship," "serving the Earth," "objective," "centralize power," "nastiness," "divisiveness," "ugliness," and "distortions" stand out as having moral connotations.

Now, for the summary, I should include these words to maintain the moral framing. I'll start by stating Santorum's criticism of Obama's policies, using "phony theology" and "radical environmentalist." Then, I'll explain Santorum's view on resource use versus serving the Earth. Next, I'll mention the Obama campaign's response, highlighting the affront and the need to focus on policies without attacking faith. I'll also include the criticism of the GOP race as "nasty" and "divisive."

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to flow logically: Santorum's criticism, his clarification, the Obama campaign's response, and the broader implications of the GOP race. I'll make sure to use the identified moral terms to preserve the original framing.

Let me draft it: Santorum criticized Obama's policies as "phony theology," arguing against radical environmentalism. He believes in using resources wisely, not serving the Earth. The Obama campaign called his remarks an affront, urging focus on policies without attacking faith. The GOP race is seen as negative and divisive.

I think that covers all the key points and preserves the moral framing. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within limits. Looks good. Time to put it all together.

He accused radical environmentalists of misplacing priorities, emphasizing that humans should use resources wisely rather than serve the Earth. Santorum clarified he wasn't questioning Obama's Christianity but his worldview, which he claims elevates the Earth above humanity. The Obama campaign strongly condemned Santorum's remarks as a personal affront, urging a focus on policy debates without attacking faith or character. They described the Republican primary as a "race to the bottom," marked by nastiness, divisiveness, and negativity, contrasting it with Obama's focus on job creation and economic security. Santorum defended his comments, linking them to a broader critique of government overreach and unproven scientific claims, such as those in the global warming debate. END OF SUMMARY.
