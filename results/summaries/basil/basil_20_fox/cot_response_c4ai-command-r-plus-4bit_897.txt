SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum has denied questioning President Obama's Christianity, despite referring to his "phony theology." Santorum clarified that he was criticizing the President's environmental policies, which he believes prioritize the Earth over human welfare. He accused Obama of promoting a "phony ideal" and a "different theology," suggesting that the President's worldview elevates the Earth above man and centralizes power in the government. While Santorum insisted he accepted Obama as a Christian, his remarks sparked strong reactions from Obama's campaign, who called them "destructive" and "over the line." The comment was labeled as part of the "ugliness" and "distortions" of the Republican primary campaign, a "race to the bottom." Robert Gibbs, the former press secretary, urged for a more respectful debate focused on political positions rather than personal character and faith. Ben Labolt, Obama's deputy press secretary, also condemned Santorum's remarks, contrasting them with the President's focus on job creation and middle-class economic security. Santorum defended his use of the word "theology," attributing it to a worldview that misplaces priorities and misrepresents scientific facts.
