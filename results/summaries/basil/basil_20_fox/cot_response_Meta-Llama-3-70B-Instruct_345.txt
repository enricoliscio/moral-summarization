SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum clarified that his "phony theology" comment was not questioning President Obama's Christianity, but rather challenging his environmental policies that prioritize the Earth's welfare over human well-being. Santorum believes in being a good steward of the Earth, but not serving it, as he thinks "man is the objective." The Obama campaign responded strongly, calling the remark a "personal affront" and "wrong." They argued that it's time to focus on debating political positions, not questioning each other's character and faith. Santorum's comment was seen as part of a "race to the bottom" in the GOP primary, marked by "nastiness," "divisiveness," and "distortions." END OF SUMMARY.
