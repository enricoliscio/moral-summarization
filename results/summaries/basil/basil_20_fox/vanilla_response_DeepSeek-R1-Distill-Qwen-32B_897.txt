Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. The user provided a detailed article about Rick Santorum's comments regarding President Obama's policies and theology. My task is to condense this into a concise summary of no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Santorum criticized Obama's environmental policies, calling them a "phony theology" that prioritizes the Earth over people. He clarified that he wasn't questioning Obama's Christianity but rather the administration's approach. The Obama campaign responded, calling the remarks an affront and urging a focus on policy instead of personal attacks.

I should include the key elements: Santorum's criticism, his clarification about not targeting Obama's faith, the Obama campaign's reaction, and the context of the Republican primary race. I need to ensure the summary is clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary details while capturing the essence of the article.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Santorum's criticism, then his clarification, followed by the Obama campaign's response, and conclude with the implications for the primary race. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll need to be succinct with each point.

Let me draft it: Start with Santorum's comments on environmental policies, clarify his stance on Obama's faith, mention the campaign's criticism, and note the contrast in the primary race. Make sure each sentence flows logically and covers all necessary points without exceeding the word limit.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together in a coherent summary.

He clarified he wasn't questioning Obama's Christianity but rather the administration's approach to energy and environmental stewardship. Santorum argued that the focus should be on using resources wisely, not serving the Earth. The Obama campaign strongly condemned the remarks, calling them a personal affront and urging a focus on policy rather than character attacks. Santorum emphasized that his criticism was about Obama's worldview, not his faith, while the Obama campaign accused the GOP race of descending into negativity and divisiveness. END OF SUMMARY.
