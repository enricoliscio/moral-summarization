SUMMARY: Rick Santorum, the new front-runner in the GOP race, accused President Obama of having a "phony theology" that prioritizes the Earth over human welfare. Santorum clarified that he wasn't questioning Obama's Christian faith but was challenging his environmental policies, which he believes are based on a "world view that elevates the Earth above man." Obama's campaign team responded strongly, calling Santorum's remarks "destructive" and a "personal affront." Robert Gibbs, the president's former press secretary, said it was time to focus on political positions rather than questioning each other's character and faith. Ben Labolt, Obama campaign deputy press secretary, called Santorum's comments "the latest low in a Republican primary campaign fueled by distortions, ugliness, and pessimism." Santorum defended his use of the word "theology," stating that he was referring to a worldview that prioritizes centralizing power and government control over scientific evidence. He maintained that he accepted Obama as a Christian but disagreed with his approach to problems. Gibbs criticized the GOP primary as a "race to the bottom" filled with nastiness and divisiveness.
