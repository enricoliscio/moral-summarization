SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum has come under fire for comments he made about President Obama's "phony theology," which he claims was a criticism of the president's environmental policies and not a question of his Christian faith. Santorum clarified that he believes Obama is a Christian but takes issue with what he sees as a radical environmentalist agenda that prioritizes the Earth over human welfare. The Obama campaign, however, has strongly criticized Santorum's remarks as a personal affront and a destructive distortion. Robert Gibbs, the president's former press secretary, called for an end to such remarks, saying that the GOP primary has been a race to the bottom filled with ugliness and divisiveness. Santorum defended his use of the word "theology," arguing that he was referring to a worldview that elevates the Earth above man and that Obama's approach to problems is different from most Americans'. This incident highlights the tense and often contentious nature of the Republican primary campaign, with accusations of negativity and character attacks being leveled at candidates. END OF SUMMARY.
