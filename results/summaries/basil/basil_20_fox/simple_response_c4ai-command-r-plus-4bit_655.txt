SUMMARY: Rick Santorum, the new frontrunner in the GOP race, sparked controversy by referring to President Obama's "phony theology" in a recent speech. Santorum clarified that he was not questioning the President's Christian faith but was instead challenging his environmental policies, which Santorum believes prioritize the Earth over human welfare. He accused the President of having a "world view that elevates the Earth above man" and using unproven scientific claims to centralize power and expand government control. The Obama campaign strongly condemned Santorum's remarks as destructive and offensive, arguing that they crossed a line by questioning the President's character and faith. Robert Gibbs, the former press secretary, called for a more respectful debate focused on political positions rather than personal attacks. Santorum defended his comments, insisting that he accepted the President as a Christian but disagreed with his approach to environmental issues and the global warming debate. END OF SUMMARY.
