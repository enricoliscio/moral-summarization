SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum clarified his recent comment about President Obama's "phony theology," saying he was not questioning the President's Christianity, but rather challenging his environmental policies. Santorum believes that Obama's policies prioritize the Earth's welfare over human well-being, which he thinks is a "radical environmentalist" view. He argues that humans should use the Earth's resources wisely, but not serve the Earth. The Obama campaign responded strongly, calling Santorum's remark a personal affront and an attack on the President's character and faith. They accused Santorum of engaging in a "race to the bottom" with his divisive and ugly comments. Santorum maintained that he was only criticizing the President's worldview and approach to problems, not his faith. He reiterated that he believes Obama is a Christian.
