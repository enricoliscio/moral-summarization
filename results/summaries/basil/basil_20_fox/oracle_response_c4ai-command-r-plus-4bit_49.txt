SUMMARY: Rick Santorum, the new frontrunner in the GOP race, made controversial remarks about President Obama's "phony theology," referring to his environmental policies that prioritize the Earth over human welfare. Santorum clarified that he was not questioning the president's Christian faith but rather challenging his worldview. Obama's campaign team strongly criticized Santorum's comments as destructive and negative, calling for a more respectful debate focused on political positions rather than personal character and faith. They highlighted the president's positive approach to creating jobs and restoring economic security for the middle class, in stark contrast to the GOP primary, which has been marred by pessimism and negativity. Santorum defended his use of the word "theology," attributing it to a worldview that elevates the Earth above man and centralizes power in the government. He accused the president of politicizing issues like global warming and attempting to discredit opponents through distortions and ugliness. This exchange showcases the moral framing of both sides, with Santorum emphasizing his beliefs about environmental stewardship and the role of government, while the Obama campaign focuses on the negative tone and potential harm caused by Santorum's remarks.
END OF SUMMARY.
