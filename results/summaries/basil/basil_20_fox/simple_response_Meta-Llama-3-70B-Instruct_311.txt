SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum clarified that his "phony theology" comment was not questioning President Obama's Christianity, but rather challenging his environmental policies that prioritize the Earth's welfare over human well-being. Santorum believes humans should use the Earth's resources wisely, but not serve the Earth as the primary objective. He accused Obama of having a "radical environmentalist" worldview that elevates the Earth above human needs. The Obama campaign responded strongly, calling Santorum's remark a personal affront and an example of the GOP primary's "nastiness, divisiveness, and ugliness." Santorum maintained that he was not questioning Obama's faith, but rather his approach to governance, which he believes is misguided and seeks to centralize power.

END OF SUMMARY.
