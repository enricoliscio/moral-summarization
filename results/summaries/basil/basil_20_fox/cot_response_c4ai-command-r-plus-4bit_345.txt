SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum has come under fire for comments he made about President Obama's "phony theology," which he claims was a critique of the president's environmental policies and not a questioning of his Christian faith. Santorum clarified that he accepts Obama as a Christian but takes issue with what he sees as a "radical environmentalist" agenda that puts the Earth above human welfare. The Obama campaign has strongly criticized Santorum's remarks as "destructive," "ugliness," and "divisiveness," arguing that they are a personal attack on the president's character and faith. Santorum defended his use of the word "theology," stating that he was referring to a worldview that elevates the Earth over man and that his comments were about policy differences, not religious beliefs. This exchange highlights the increasingly negative tone of the GOP primary race, with accusations of distortions and character attacks. END OF SUMMARY.
