SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum defended his comments about President Obama's "phony theology," claiming he was not questioning the President's Christianity, but rather challenging his environmental policies that prioritize the Earth's welfare over human well-being. Santorum believes that humans should use the Earth's resources wisely, but not serve the Earth as the primary objective. He accuses "radical environmentalists" of having it "upside down." The Obama campaign responded strongly, calling Santorum's remarks a personal affront and an attack on the President's character and faith. They argued that it's time to focus on debating political positions, not questioning each other's faith. Santorum maintains that he was referring to the President's "world view" that elevates the Earth above humans, which he believes is misguided and aims to centralize power. The exchange highlights the divisive and negative tone of the GOP primary.
