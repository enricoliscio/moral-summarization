Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

Rick Santorum made a statement about President Obama's "phony theology," but he clarified it wasn't about Obama's faith. Instead, he was criticizing Obama's environmental policies, arguing that they prioritize the Earth over people. Santorum believes that people should use resources wisely but not serve the Earth. He also mentioned global warming as an example, saying it's based on unproven claims.

The Obama campaign responded strongly, calling Santorum's remarks a personal attack and inappropriate. They emphasized that the debate should focus on policies, not personal character or faith.

Santorum's comments were part of the Republican primary, where he's leading against Romney. The article also mentions that the primary has been negative and divisive.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral elements intact. The key points are Santorum's criticism of Obama's environmental policies, his clarification about not questioning Obama's faith, the Obama campaign's response about it being a personal attack, and the context of the negative primary race.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral framing, showing Santorum's stance on environmental stewardship versus Obama's policies, and the campaign's reaction to the personal nature of the attack.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements without getting too detailed. Also, I should use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as specified.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and covers all necessary points succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
Rick Santorum clarified that his recent criticism of President Obama's "phony theology" was not aimed at questioning Obama's Christian faith but rather challenging policies that prioritize environmental stewardship over human welfare. Santorum argued that the Earth is not the objective, but rather man should use resources wisely without serving the Earth. He criticized radical environmentalism and the politicization of global warming, linking it to government overreach. However, the Obama campaign condemned Santorum's remarks as a personal affront, calling them destructive and inappropriate. Robert Gibbs, a former Obama press secretary, emphasized that debates should focus on policies, not character or faith. Santorum reiterated that he respects Obama's faith but disagrees with his worldview, which he claims prioritizes the Earth over people. The Obama campaign accused the Republican primary of being negative and divisive, contrasting it with Obama's focus on jobs and economic security.  
END OF SUMMARY.
