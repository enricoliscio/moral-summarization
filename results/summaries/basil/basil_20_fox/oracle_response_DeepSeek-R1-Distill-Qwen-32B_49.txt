Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the context.

Rick Santorum is talking about President Obama's policies, specifically referring to "phony theology." He clarifies that he's not questioning Obama's Christianity but is challenging the environmental policies that prioritize the Earth over people. He mentions radical environmentalists and the idea that man should serve the Earth, which he finds phony. Santorum argues that man should use Earth's resources wisely, not serve the Earth.

The Obama campaign responds, calling Santorum's remarks a personal affront. They say it's wrong and destructive, urging a focus on political positions rather than attacking character and faith. They describe Santorum's comments as part of a campaign fueled by distortions, pessimism, and negativity, contrasting with Obama's focus on jobs and economic security.

Santorum explains that when he used "theology," he meant a worldview elevating Earth above man, citing unproven claims like global warming politicization. He believes this is an attempt to centralize power. He maintains he's not questioning Obama's faith but his approach to problems, which he says differs from most Americans'.

The article uses words like "remarks," "pessimism," "negativity," "focused," "creating," "restoring," "politicization," "attempt," "centralize," "give," "approaches," "nastiness," "divisiveness," "ugliness," "distortions." I need to include as many as possible in the summary.

I'll structure the summary by mentioning Santorum's challenge to Obama's policies, his clarification on not questioning faith, the Obama campaign's criticism, and the moral framing words. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include the key points and the moral terms.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring I include all necessary elements and the specified moral words.

Rick Santorum recently criticized President Obama's policies, describing them as driven by a "phony theology" that prioritizes the Earth over people. Santorum clarified he wasn't questioning Obama's Christianity but rather a radical environmentalist worldview that he believes places Earth stewardship above human welfare. He argued that man should use resources wisely, not serve the Earth, calling this perspective "upside down." The Obama campaign sharply condemned Santorum's remarks as a personal affront, labeling them as "wrong" and "destructive." They emphasized the importance of focusing on political issues rather than attacking character or faith. Santorum's comments were described as part of a Republican primary campaign marked by "pessimism," "negativity," "nastiness," "divisiveness," and "ugliness." He defended his stance, stating his criticism was about Obama's "worldview" and "approaches" to governance, which he claimed differ from mainstream American values. Santorum also criticized the politicization of global warming, suggesting it's an attempt to "centralize power" and "give" more control to the government. The Obama campaign contrasted Santorum's remarks with their focus on "creating" jobs and "restoring" economic security.
