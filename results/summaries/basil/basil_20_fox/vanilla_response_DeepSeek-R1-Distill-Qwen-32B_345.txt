Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum's comments regarding President Obama. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, Santorum made a statement about Obama's "phony theology," which he later clarified wasn't about Obama's Christianity but about his environmental policies. He argues that Obama's approach puts Earth stewardship above people's welfare, which he sees as a flawed worldview. He criticized the idea that man should serve the Earth, instead believing resources should be used wisely for human benefit. He also linked this to government overreach and the global warming debate.

The Obama campaign responded strongly, calling his remarks a personal affront and unnecessary attacks on character and faith. They emphasized the need for policy debate without attacking personal beliefs. Santorum, leading in polls, insists he wasn't questioning Obama's faith, only his policies and worldview.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Santorum's clarification, his criticism of Obama's environmental policies, the Obama campaign's reaction, and the context of the Republican primary.

Make sure to include key points: Santorum's clarification, his argument about stewardship, the Obama campaign's criticism, and the political context. Keep it concise and clear.
