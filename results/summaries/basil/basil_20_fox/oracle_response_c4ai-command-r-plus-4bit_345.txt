SUMMARY: Rick Santorum, the new frontrunner in the GOP race, made comments about President Obama's "phony theology," referring to his environmental policies that prioritize the Earth over human welfare. Santorum clarified that he wasn't questioning the president's Christian faith but rather challenging his worldview. The Obama campaign, through former press secretary Robert Gibbs and deputy press secretary Ben Labolt, strongly condemned Santorum's remarks as destructive and negative, emphasizing that the focus should be on creating jobs and restoring economic security for the middle class. They characterized Santorum's comment as a distortion and a personal affront. Santorum defended his use of the word "theology," saying it referred to a worldview that elevates the Earth above man. He criticized the politicization of the global warming debate and accused the president of trying to centralize power. Gibbs lamented the nastiness, divisiveness, and distortions prevalent in the GOP primary campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
