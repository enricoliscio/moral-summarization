Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing provided by the author. The article is about Rick Santorum's comments on President Obama's policies and the reactions from the Obama campaign. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally framed words as possible from the list provided.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Santorum criticized Obama's environmental policies, calling them a "phony theology," which he later clarified was about a worldview that prioritizes the Earth over people. He emphasized that man should be the objective, not the Earth. The Obama campaign, through Gibbs and Labolt, responded by saying Santorum's remarks were over the line, personal, and destructive, suggesting the campaign is focused on creating jobs and restoring economic security. They criticized the Republican primary as being negative and divisive.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words in the article. The user provided a list: remarks, pessimism, negativity, focused, creating, restoring, politicization, attempt, centralize, give, approaches, nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness, distortions. I should incorporate as many of these as possible into the summary without making it too long (under 200 words).

I'll start by outlining the key points: Santorum's criticism of Obama's policies, his clarification, the Obama campaign's response, and the broader implications of the GOP race. I'll use words like "remarks," "negative," "creating," "restoring," "approaches," "nastiness," "divisiveness," "ugliness," "distortions," and "centralize."

I should ensure that the summary flows naturally while including these terms. I'll make sure to mention Santorum's comments on the "phony theology" as a critique of a worldview, the Obama campaign's focus on job creation and economic security, and the criticism of the GOP race as being marked by negativity and divisiveness.

I'll structure the summary to first present Santorum's argument, then the Obama campaign's response, and finally the broader context of the GOP race. This should cover all the main points while integrating the morally framed words.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. I'll write a concise summary, making sure each sentence adds value and includes the necessary terms without being redundant.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the moral framing intended by the author.

SUMMARY: Rick Santorum criticized President Obama's environmental policies, calling them a "phony theology," though he clarified he was not questioning Obama's Christianity but rather a worldview that prioritizes the Earth over humanity. Santorum argued that man should be the objective, not the Earth, and accused radical environmentalists of "politicizing" issues like global warming to "centralize power" and "give" more control to the government. The Obama campaign strongly condemned Santorum's remarks as a "personal affront," describing them as "wrong" and "destructive." They emphasized the president's focus on "creating jobs" and "restoring economic security" for the middle class, while criticizing the GOP primary for its "nastiness," "divisiveness," and "ugliness." Santorum denied targeting Obama's faith, insisting he was addressing the president's "approaches" to policy, which he claimed differ from those of most Americans. The campaign also accused the GOP race of being fueled by "distortions" and "pessimism," highlighting the contrast with Obama's priorities. END OF SUMMARY.
