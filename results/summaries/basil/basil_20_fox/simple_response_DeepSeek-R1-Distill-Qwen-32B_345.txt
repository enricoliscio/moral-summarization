Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand what's going on.

Rick Santorum is talking about President Obama's policies, specifically referring to "phony theology." He clarifies that he's not questioning Obama's Christianity but rather the environmental policies that prioritize the Earth over people. Santorum argues that the Earth shouldn't be the focus but rather man's use of resources wisely. He mentions radical environmentalists and the politicization of global warming, suggesting it's about centralizing power.

On the other hand, the Obama campaign is upset, saying Santorum's comments are an affront, questioning character and faith, which is destructive. They want the focus to be on policies, not personal attacks.

I need to summarize this, keeping the moral elements. The key points are Santorum's criticism of Obama's environmental policies, his clarification on not targeting Obama's faith, and the Obama campaign's response about the attacks being personal and harmful.

I should make sure to include the moral framing, like Santorum's view on stewardship vs. serving the Earth, and the Obama campaign's stance against personal attacks in politics.

Let me structure this into a concise summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and captures the moral aspects as the author presented them.

SUMMARY:  
Rick Santorum clarified that his recent criticism of President Obama's "phony theology" was not aimed at questioning Obama's Christianity but rather challenging policies that prioritize environmental stewardship over human welfare. Santorum argued that the Earth is not the objective, and man should use resources wisely without serving the planet. He accused radical environmentalists of distorting the role of humanity and linked their views to unproven claims, such as global warming politicization, to centralize power.  

The Obama campaign strongly condemned Santorum's remarks, calling them a personal affront and a destructive attack on the president's character and faith. They urged a focus on policy debates rather than personal attacks. Santorum, leading in Republican polls, maintained he was criticizing Obama's worldview, not his faith, and accused the GOP race of descending into negativity.  

END OF SUMMARY.
