SUMMARY: Rick Santorum, the new frontrunner in the GOP race, found himself in hot water after referring to President Obama's "phony theology" in a speech. Santorum later clarified that he was not questioning the president's Christian faith but was instead challenging his environmental policies, which Santorum believes place the Earth above human welfare. He accused the president of being influenced by "radical environmentalists" who want to centralize power and give more control to the government. The Obama campaign hit back hard, with former press secretary Robert Gibbs calling the remarks "well over the line" and "destructive." Gibbs and Obama campaign deputy press secretary Ben LaBolt characterized Santorum's comments as a personal attack on the president's character and faith. They contrasted the negativity of the GOP primary campaign with the president's positive focus on job creation and middle-class economic security. Santorum defended his use of the word "theology," saying it referred to a worldview that elevates the Earth above man. He denied questioning the president's faith and said he accepted Obama as a Christian. Gibbs lamented the "race to the bottom" nature of the GOP primary, which he said has been marked by ugliness and divisiveness.
END OF SUMMARY.
