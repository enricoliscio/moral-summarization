Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed words in the article and then write a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to get the gist. It's about Rick Santorum criticizing President Obama's environmental policies, using terms like "phony theology" and "radical environmentalists." The article also mentions the Obama campaign's response, calling Santorum's remarks an affront and destructive.

For step one, I need to find all the single words that carry moral connotations. Words like "questioning," "challenging," "phony," "welfare," "stewardship," "serving," "objective," "resources," "wisely," "care," "steward," "upside down," "affront," "destructive," "distortions," "ugliness," "pessimism," "negativity," "centralize," "power," "qualify," "nastiness," "divisiveness," "distortions," "records." These words seem to carry moral weight because they imply judgment or evaluation of actions and policies.

Next, I'll summarize the article, making sure to include these moral terms. I need to keep it under 200 words. I'll start by stating Santorum's criticism of Obama's policies, using "phony theology" and "radical environmentalists." Then, I'll mention the Obama campaign's reaction, highlighting "affront" and "destructive." I'll also include the contrast between the two worldviews and the campaign's criticism of Santorum's approach as "nastiness" and "divisiveness."

I should ensure the summary flows naturally and accurately reflects the article's content while preserving the moral framing. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Let me put it all together, making sure each point is clear and concise.

**SUMMARY:**  
Rick Santorum criticized President Obama's environmental policies, describing them as based on a "phony theology" that prioritizes the Earth over human welfare. He argued that Obama's approach, which he called "radical environmentalism," incorrectly places the Earth's needs above humanity's. Santorum emphasized that humans should use resources wisely but not serve the Earth, calling this worldview "upside down." The Obama campaign strongly condemned Santorum's remarks, labeling them as a "personal affront" and "destructive." Campaign spokesperson Robert Gibbs accused Santorum of crossing the line, stating that the focus should be on policy debates rather than attacking character or faith. Santorum denied questioning Obama's Christianity, clarifying his criticism was about Obama's "worldview" and policies, which he accused of being based on unproven claims, such as those related to global warming. The Obama campaign further criticized Santorum's comments as part of a "race to the bottom" in the GOP primary, marked by "nastiness" and "divisiveness."
