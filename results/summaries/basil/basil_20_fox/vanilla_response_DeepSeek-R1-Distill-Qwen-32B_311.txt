Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum's comments regarding President Obama. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, Santorum is talking about Obama's policies, specifically referring to them as "phony theology." He clarifies that he's not questioning Obama's Christianity but is instead criticizing the environmental policies that prioritize the Earth over people. He mentions that the Earth isn't the objective, and man should use resources wisely without serving the Earth. 

Then, the Obama campaign responds, calling his remarks a personal affront. They argue that the focus should be on policies, not attacking character or faith. Santorum later explains that by "theology," he meant a worldview that puts the Earth above humans, citing issues like global warming and government overreach.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Santorum's main points, his clarification, the Obama campaign's response, and the context of the GOP race. Make sure to mention the key terms like "phony theology," environmental policies, and the political implications.

Let me structure it: start with Santorum's statement, his clarification, the campaign's reaction, and the broader implications of the comments in the Republican race. Keep it concise and clear.

I should also ensure that the summary flows well and covers all essential points without getting too detailed. Maybe mention Santorum's position in the polls as it adds context to why this is significant.

Alright, putting it all together now.
