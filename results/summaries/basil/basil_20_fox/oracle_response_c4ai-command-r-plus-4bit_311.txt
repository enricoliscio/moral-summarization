SUMMARY: Rick Santorum denied questioning President Obama's Christian faith after referring to his "phony theology" in a recent speech. Santorum clarified that he was criticizing the President's environmental policies, which he believes prioritize the Earth over human welfare. He accused Obama of having a "world view that elevates the Earth above man," and suggested that the President's agenda is about "centralizing power" and "giving more power to the government." The Obama campaign responded strongly, calling Santorum's remarks "destructive" and "over the line." Robert Gibbs, the former press secretary, said it was time to focus on a debate about political positions rather than questioning each other's character and faith. He criticized the Republican primary campaign as being fueled by pessimism, negativity, and distortions. Santorum defended his use of the word "theology," arguing that he was referring to a worldview that approaches problems from a perspective different from most Americans. Gibbs called for an end to the "nastiness, divisiveness, and ugliness" of the GOP primary race, urging a more respectful and policy-focused dialogue. END OF SUMMARY.
