SUMMARY: Rick Santorum, the new frontrunner in the GOP race, referred to President Obama's "phony theology" in a recent comment, sparking backlash from the Obama campaign. Santorum clarified that he was not questioning the president's Christian faith but was challenging his environmental policies, which Santorum believes place the Earth above human welfare. He accused Obama of having a "world view that elevates the Earth above man" and centralizing power in the government under the guise of environmental protection. The Obama campaign, through Robert Gibbs and Ben Labolt, denounced Santorum's remarks as destructive and a personal affront, calling for a debate focused on political positions rather than character attacks. Santorum defended his use of the word "theology," arguing that he was referring to a worldview and not the president's faith. Gibbs expressed disappointment in the divisive and negative tone of the GOP primary campaign. Santorum's comments highlight the tension between environmental protection and human welfare, with Santorum prioritizing the latter.
