SUMMARY: 
Former Senator Rick Santorum sparked controversy by accusing President Obama of espousing a "phony theology" that prioritizes environmental stewardship over human welfare. Santorum later clarified that he was not questioning Obama's Christian faith but rather challenging his environmental policies, which Santorum believes are "upside down" and based on unproven scientific claims. Obama's campaign team strongly condemned Santorum's remarks as "destructive" and "over the line," arguing that they reflect the "ugliness" and "distortions" prevalent in the Republican primary campaign. Santorum defended his use of the word "theology," stating that he was referring to a worldview that elevates the Earth above man, and accused the President of centralizing power and politicizing issues like global warming. Despite his initial comments, Santorum affirmed that he accepts Obama as a Christian but disagrees with his approach to governance. The exchange highlights the increasingly negative tone of the GOP primary race, with accusations of "divisiveness" and a "race to the bottom."
END OF SUMMARY.
