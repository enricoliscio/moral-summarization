SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum defended his comments about President Obama's "phony theology," claiming he was not questioning the President's Christianity, but rather challenging his environmental policies that prioritize the Earth's welfare over human well-being. Santorum believes that humans should use the Earth's resources wisely, but not serve the Earth as their primary objective. He accused Obama of having a "radical environmentalist" worldview that elevates the Earth above human needs. The Obama campaign responded strongly, calling Santorum's remarks a personal affront and an attempt to disqualify the President's faith. Santorum maintained that he was not questioning Obama's faith, but rather his approach to governance, which he believes is misguided and driven by a desire to centralize power.

END OF SUMMARY.
