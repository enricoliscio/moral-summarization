SUMMARY: Rick Santorum, the new frontrunner in the GOP race, referred to President Obama's "phony theology" over the weekend, sparking backlash from the Obama campaign. Santorum clarified that he was not questioning the President's Christian faith but was instead challenging his environmental policies, which Santorum believes prioritize the Earth over human welfare. He accused the President of having a "world view that elevates the Earth above man" and using the global warming debate to centralize power. The Obama campaign, through former press secretary Robert Gibbs and deputy press secretary Ben Labolt, called Santorum's remarks "destructive" and "over the line," urging for a more respectful debate focused on political positions rather than personal attacks. Gibbs also criticized the GOP primary for its "nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness, and distortions." Santorum reiterated his belief in the President's Christianity while defending his own comments as a critique of Obama's approach to environmental issues. END OF SUMMARY.
