SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum clarified that his comment about President Obama's "phony theology" was not questioning the president's Christianity, but rather challenging his environmental policies that prioritize the Earth over human welfare. Santorum believes that humans should be good stewards of the Earth, but not serve it, and that Obama's "radical environmentalist" views are misguided. The Obama campaign responded strongly, calling Santorum's remark a "personal affront" and "wrong" and "destructive". They accused Santorum of engaging in "nastiness", "divisiveness", and "ugliness" in the GOP primary. Santorum maintained that he was criticizing Obama's "world view" that elevates the Earth above man, which he believes is based on unproven scientific claims and is an attempt to centralize power. The exchange highlights the "stark contrast" between Obama's focus on job creation and Santorum's pessimistic views.
