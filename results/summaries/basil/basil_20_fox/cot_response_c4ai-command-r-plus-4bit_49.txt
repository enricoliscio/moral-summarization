SUMMARY: Rick Santorum, the new frontrunner in the GOP race, sparked controversy by referring to President Obama's "phony theology" and suggesting that the President prioritizes the Earth over people. Santorum later clarified that he was not questioning Obama's Christianity but challenging his environmental policies and worldview, which Santorum believes place the Earth above human welfare. The Obama campaign forcefully responded, calling Santorum's remarks "destructive" and "over the line." They accused Santorum of engaging in "ugliness" and "distortions" and of questioning the President's character and faith. Santorum defended his use of the word "theology," stating that he was referring to a worldview that "elevates the Earth above man." He accused the President of centralizing power and politicizing issues like global warming. Santorum reiterated that he believes Obama is a Christian but disagrees with his approach to problems. The exchange highlights the divisive and negative tone of the GOP primary, with accusations of "nastiness" and "divisiveness" from both sides.
