SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum clarified his recent comment about President Obama's "phony theology," stating that he was not questioning the President's Christianity, but rather challenging his environmental policies that prioritize the Earth's welfare over human well-being. Santorum argued that this "radical environmentalist" view is misguided, as humans are meant to be good stewards of the Earth, not serve it. The Obama campaign responded strongly, calling Santorum's remark a personal affront and an attempt to disqualify the President's faith. However, Santorum maintained that he was targeting the President's "world view" that elevates the Earth above human needs, citing the politicization of global warming as an example. The exchange highlights the divisive and negative tone of the GOP primary race, with some arguing that it's time to focus on policy debates rather than personal attacks.

END OF SUMMARY.
