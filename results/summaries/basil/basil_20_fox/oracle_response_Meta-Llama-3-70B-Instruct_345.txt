SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum clarified that his "phony theology" comment was not questioning President Obama's Christianity, but rather challenging his environmental policies that prioritize the Earth's welfare over human well-being. Santorum believes in being a good steward of the Earth, but not serving it, as he thinks radical environmentalists have it "upside down." The Obama campaign responded forcefully, calling the remark a personal affront and an example of the GOP primary's "nastiness, divisiveness, and ugliness." They argued that it's time to focus on debating political positions, not questioning each other's character and faith. Santorum maintained that he was referring to a "world view that elevates the Earth above man," which he believes is driven by an attempt to "centralize power and give more power to the government." The exchange highlights the pessimism and negativity that has characterized the GOP primary, with both sides accusing each other of distortions and politicization.

END OF SUMMARY.
