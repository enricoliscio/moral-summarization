SUMMARY: Rick Santorum, the new frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, made comments about President Obama's "phony theology," suggesting that the President places the Earth's well-being above that of its inhabitants. Santorum clarified that he was not questioning the President's Christian faith but rather challenging his environmental policies. He believes that the President's worldview elevates the Earth above man and that this is not based on scientifically proven claims. The Obama campaign responded strongly, with Robert Gibbs, the former press secretary, calling the remarks "well over the line" and destructive. Ben Labolt, the deputy press secretary, also issued a statement criticizing the Republican primary campaign for its negativity and distortions. Gibbs expressed concern about the nastiness and divisiveness of the GOP primary and the tendency to disqualify each other over disagreements. Santorum reiterated his belief that the President is a Christian but criticized his approach to environmental issues.
