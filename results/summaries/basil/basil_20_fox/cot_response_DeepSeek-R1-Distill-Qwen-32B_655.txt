Okay, so I need to summarize this news article where Rick Santorum is talking about President Obama's policies. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words and then write a summary preserving those moral terms.

First, I'll read through the article again to spot the morally charged words. Santorum mentions "phony theology," which is a strong term against Obama's environmental policies. He also talks about "radical environmentalists" and their "phony ideal." He criticizes the idea of serving the Earth over people, calling it "upside down" and "wrong." The Obama campaign responds, calling Santorum's remarks "wrong," "destructive," and part of a "race to the bottom" with "nastiness" and "divisiveness." They also mention "distortions" and "searing pessimism." So, I'll list all these words as morally framed.

Next, I'll write a concise summary. I need to include Santorum's criticism of Obama's environmental policies, his use of "phony theology," and the Obama campaign's strong response. I should keep the moral terms like "phony," "radical," "wrong," "destructive," etc., to maintain the original framing. I'll make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally.

I think I have all the key points: Santorum's critique, the moral terms used, and the Obama campaign's reaction. Time to put it all together clearly and succinctly.

**SUMMARY:**
Rick Santorum criticized President Obama's environmental policies, calling them a "phony theology" that prioritizes the Earth over people. He argued that Obama's approach, which he described as a "world view that elevates the Earth above man," is misguided and not based on science. Santorum emphasized that man should use resources wisely and be stewards of the Earth, not serve it. However, the Obama campaign strongly condemned Santorum's remarks, calling them a personal affront and "wrong" and "destructive." They accused the Republican primary race of descending into "nastiness, divisiveness, and searing pessimism." Santorum denied questioning Obama's faith, stating he was targeting Obama's policies, which he believes prioritize the environment over people's well-being. The campaign accused Santorum of distorting facts and centralizing power, while Santorum defended his stance as a contrast to Obama's focus on job creation and economic security.
