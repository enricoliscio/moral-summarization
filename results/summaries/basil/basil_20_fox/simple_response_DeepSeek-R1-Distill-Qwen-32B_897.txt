Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rick Santorum's comments regarding President Obama's policies and theology. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author provided. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Santorum criticized Obama's environmental policies, calling them a "phony theology" that puts Earth stewardship above people's welfare. He clarified he wasn't questioning Obama's Christianity but rather his worldview. The Obama campaign responded by calling the remarks an affront and criticized the negativity in the GOP race.

I should focus on Santorum's main arguments: his critique of environmental policies as prioritizing Earth over people, his clarification on not questioning Obama's faith, and the campaign's strong response. Also, note the mention of global warming and centralizing power as part of his critique.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it reflects the moral aspects, like the clash between environmentalism and human welfare, and the political attack on Obama's policies and character.

I'll structure the summary to first state Santorum's criticism, then his clarification, followed by the Obama campaign's reaction, and end with the implications of the debate. I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing by emphasizing the values and priorities at stake.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit, capturing all essential points without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY:  
Rick Santorum criticized President Obama's environmental policies, describing them as a "phony theology" that prioritizes Earth stewardship over human welfare. He clarified he wasn't questioning Obama's Christianity but rather his worldview, which he argued elevates the Earth above humanity. Santorum accused radical environmentalists of misusing resources and politicizing issues like global warming to centralize power. The Obama campaign strongly condemned Santorum's remarks, calling them a personal affront and a distraction from policy debates. Santorum maintained his focus was on Obama's approach to problems, not his faith, but the campaign accused the GOP race of descending into negativity and divisiveness. The debate highlights a clash over values, with Santorum emphasizing human-centric resource use and the Obama campaign defending a focus on job creation and economic security.  
END OF SUMMARY.
