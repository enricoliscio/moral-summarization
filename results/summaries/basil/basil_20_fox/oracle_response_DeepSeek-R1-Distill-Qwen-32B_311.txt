Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Rick Santorum criticizing President Obama's environmental policies, using terms like "phony theology." The author used specific morally charged words, so I should include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Santorum is challenging Obama's policies, arguing that they prioritize the Earth over people. He uses the term "phony theology" to describe this view, which he contrasts with a Christian stewardship perspective. The Obama campaign responds by saying Santorum's remarks are an affront, attacking Obama's character and faith.

I need to highlight the moral terms like "remarks," "pessimism," "negativity," "creating," "restoring," "politicization," "attempt," "centralize," "give," "approaches," "nastiness," "divisiveness," "ugliness," and "distortions." These words convey the negative tone of the article towards Santorum's comments.

I'll structure the summary to include Santorum's arguments, the Obama campaign's response, and the moral framing. I'll make sure to mention the key points: Santorum's criticism of Obama's environmental policies, his use of "phony theology," the Obama campaign calling his remarks an affront, and the overall negative tone of the GOP race.

I should keep the summary concise, around 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while including the required moral terms. I'll avoid adding my own opinions and stick to the facts presented in the article, maintaining the author's moral perspective.

SUMMARY:  
Rick Santorum criticized President Obama's environmental policies, calling them a "phony theology" that prioritizes the Earth over human welfare. He argued that Obama's approach, which he described as a "world view that elevates the Earth above man," is misguided and not rooted in Christian stewardship. Santorum accused radical environmentalists of politicizing issues like global warming and centralizing power in the government, claiming their views are scientifically unproven. While he stated he accepts Obama as a Christian, he emphasized that Obama's "approaches" to policy differ from mainstream American values.  

The Obama campaign strongly condemned Santorum's remarks, calling them a "personal affront" and a "distortion" of Obama's record. Robert Gibbs, Obama's former press secretary, accused the GOP race of being "nasty," "divisive," and "ugly," urging a focus on policy debates rather than attacking character and faith. Santorum's comments were described as part of a "race to the bottom" in the Republican primary, marked by "pessimism" and "negativity."  

Santorum defended his remarks, clarifying he was targeting Obama's "world view," not his faith. However, the Obama campaign argued that Santorum's "politicization" of environmental issues and "attempt" to centralize power reflect a broader pattern of "distortions" and "ugliness" in the GOP race.  

END OF SUMMARY.
