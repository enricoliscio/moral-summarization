SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum clarified his statement about President Obama's "phony theology," saying he wasn't questioning the President's Christianity, but rather challenging his environmental policies that prioritize the Earth's welfare over human well-being. Santorum believes humans should use the Earth's resources wisely, but not serve the Earth. He called this ideal "radical environmentalism" and accused Obama of having a "world view that elevates the Earth above man." The Obama campaign responded forcefully, calling Santorum's remarks a "personal affront" and "destructive." They accused Santorum of fueling the Republican primary campaign with "distortions, ugliness, and searing pessimism and negativity." Santorum denied questioning Obama's faith, but said his approach to problems is different from most Americans. The exchange highlights the "nastiness, divisiveness, and ugliness" of the GOP primary, with both sides accusing each other of politicizing issues and distorting records.

END OF SUMMARY.
