Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so they probably want the summary to reflect the ethical implications and the perspectives presented in the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rick Santorum is talking about President Obama's policies, specifically regarding environmental stewardship. He uses the term "phony theology" to criticize the idea that man should serve the Earth rather than use its resources wisely. Santorum argues that man is the objective, not the Earth, and that Obama's policies are part of a radical environmentalist worldview that's not based on science or the Bible.

On the other hand, the Obama campaign responds by saying Santorum's comments are a personal affront and attack on Obama's character and faith. They want the debate to focus on policies, not personal attacks. Santorum clarifies that he's not questioning Obama's Christianity but rather his policies. However, the Obama campaign sees this as part of a trend in the GOP race towards negativity and divisiveness.

I need to make sure the summary captures both Santorum's critique of environmental policies and the Obama campaign's response about the personal attacks. Also, highlighting the moral framing: Santorum's argument about man's role versus the environment, and the campaign's concern about the tone of the race.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it's a balanced summary that includes both perspectives. I'll structure it by first stating Santorum's position, then the Obama campaign's response, and conclude with the implications on the political debate's tone.

Let me start drafting: Santorum criticizes Obama's policies as prioritizing Earth over people, calling it a false theology. He argues man should use resources wisely, not serve the Earth. The Obama campaign says his comments are an attack on Obama's faith and character, urging focus on policies instead of personal attacks. Santorum insists he's targeting Obama's worldview, not his faith, but the campaign sees this as part of a negative trend in the GOP race. The summary should reflect the ethical debate over environmental policy and the criticism of personal attacks in politics.

I think that's a good start. I'll make sure it's clear and concise, sticking to the key points without adding extra details.

Rick Santorum criticized President Obama's environmental policies, describing them as prioritizing the Earth over human welfare, and accused them of being based on a "phony theology." He argued that man should use Earth's resources wisely rather than serve the planet, calling this radical environmentalism "upside down." Santorum clarified he wasn't questioning Obama's Christianity but rather his worldview, which he claimed prioritizes the Earth over people. However, the Obama campaign condemned Santorum's remarks as a personal affront, stating they were "wrong and destructive" and urged the focus to remain on policy debates rather than attacking character or faith. Santorum defended his comments, emphasizing his critique of Obama's policies, but the campaign accused the GOP race of descending into negativity and divisiveness.  
END OF SUMMARY.
