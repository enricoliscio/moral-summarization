Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Rick Santorum's comments regarding President Obama's policies and theology. Santorum claims he's not questioning Obama's Christianity but rather his environmental policies. The Obama campaign responds by calling his remarks a personal affront.

Next, I need to identify all the morally framed single words. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "questioning," "phony," "challenging," "place," "stewardship," "welfare," "serving," "husband," "resources," "good," "ideal," "wise," "care," "steward," "objective," "man," "upside down," "personal affront," "wrong," "destructive," "distortions," "ugliness," "pessimism," "negativity," "stark contrast," "focused," "creating," "restoring," "security," "mindset," "disqualify," "nastiness," "divisiveness," "distortions," "opponents," "centralize," "power," "government."

Now, I have to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words. I'll make sure the summary captures Santorum's points, the Obama campaign's response, and the context of the Republican primary.

I'll start by stating Santorum's clarification, then his views on environmental policies, the Obama campaign's reaction, and the broader implications of the GOP race. I'll ensure the moral terms are included to reflect the original framing.

Finally, I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit and that the summary flows naturally while preserving the moral elements.

**SUMMARY:**  
Rick Santorum clarified that he was not questioning President Obama's Christianity but rather challenging Obama's "phony theology" regarding environmental policies that prioritize the Earth over human welfare. Santorum argued that the idea of man serving the Earth is misguided, stating that humans should use resources wisely as stewards, not serve the planet. He criticized radical environmentalists for prioritizing the Earth over people and accused them of using unproven claims, like global warming, to centralize power. The Obama campaign strongly condemned Santorum's remarks as a personal affront, calling them wrong and destructive. They emphasized the need to focus on political issues rather than attacking character or faith. Santorum's comments were seen as part of a GOP primary race marked by ugliness and negativity, contrasting with Obama's focus on job creation and economic security. END OF SUMMARY.
