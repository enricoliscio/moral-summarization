SUMMARY: Former Senator Rick Santorum, the new frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, made comments over the weekend referring to President Obama's "phony theology," suggesting that the President prioritizes the environment over human welfare. Santorum clarified that he was not questioning the President's Christian faith but rather challenging his environmental policies. He accused radical environmentalists of prioritizing the Earth over human needs and criticized the politicization of the global warming debate. The Obama campaign, through former press secretary Robert Gibbs and deputy press secretary Ben Labolt, strongly condemned Santorum's remarks as offensive and destructive, calling for a more respectful debate focused on policy differences rather than personal attacks. They characterized Santorum's comments as part of a negative and divisive Republican primary campaign, contrasting it with the President's focus on job creation and middle-class economic security. Santorum defended his use of the word "theology," referring to a worldview that elevates the Earth above man, while reiterating his belief in the President's Christian faith. Gibbs expressed concern about the negative tone of the Republican primary, urging a shift towards respectful disagreement. Santorum and Gibbs made their comments on separate Sunday morning talk shows.
