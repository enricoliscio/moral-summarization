SUMMARY: Rick Santorum, the new frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, made controversial remarks about President Obama's "phony theology," which he later clarified as referring to the President's environmental policies and worldview. Santorum claimed that Obama prioritizes the Earth over human welfare, which he deemed as "upside down." He also questioned the scientific validity of global warming claims, suggesting they are used to centralize power. Despite Santorum's insistence that he accepts Obama as a Christian, the Obama campaign and its surrogates strongly condemned the remarks as offensive and destructive, calling for a more respectful debate focused on political positions. Robert Gibbs, the former press secretary, characterized the Republican primary as a "race to the bottom" marred by negativity and distortions. The incident highlights the increasingly negative tone of the campaign and the challenge of maintaining respectful discourse while engaging in political discourse. 

END OF SUMMARY.
