SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum clarified his recent comment about President Obama's "phony theology," saying it wasn't a question of the president's Christianity, but rather a challenge to his environmental policies. Santorum believes that Obama's approach prioritizes the Earth's welfare over human well-being, which he considers a "radical environmentalist" view. He argues that humans should use the Earth's resources wisely, but not serve the Earth itself. The Obama campaign responded strongly, calling the remark a personal affront and an attempt to disqualify the president's faith. Santorum maintains that he was referring to Obama's "world view" and not his faith, which he accepts as Christian. The exchange highlights the divisive tone of the GOP primary, with Santorum's critics accusing him of ugliness and negativity.

END OF SUMMARY.
