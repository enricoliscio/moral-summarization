SUMMARY: Rick Santorum, the new frontrunner in the GOP race, made comments over the weekend referring to President Obama's "phony theology," which has sparked backlash from the Obama campaign. Santorum clarified that he was not questioning the President's Christian faith but was instead challenging his environmental policies, which Santorum believes place the Earth above human welfare. Santorum accused Obama of having a "world view that elevates the Earth above man," and suggested that the President's agenda is about "centralizing power and giving more power to the government." The Obama campaign, through Robert Gibbs and Ben Labolt, strongly condemned Santorum's remarks as destructive and divisive, calling them "a stark contrast with the president who is focused everyday on creating jobs and restoring economic security for the middle class." Santorum defended his use of the word "theology," but denied questioning Obama's character or faith. The exchange highlights the negative and pessimistic tone of the Republican primary campaign, with accusations of distortions and ugliness.
END OF SUMMARY.
