SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum clarified his comments about President Obama's "phony theology," stating that he was not questioning the President's Christianity, but rather challenging his environmental policies that prioritize the Earth's welfare over human well-being. Santorum believes that humans are meant to use the Earth's resources wisely, not serve the Earth. He accused Obama's campaign of promoting a "radical environmentalist" agenda that is "destructive" and "wrong." The Obama campaign responded forcefully, calling Santorum's remarks a "personal affront" and a "low" in the Republican primary campaign, which has been marked by "distortions, ugliness, and searing pessimism and negativity." Santorum's comments were seen as an attempt to "centralize power" and "give more power to the government." The exchange highlights the "nastiness, divisiveness, and ugliness" of the GOP primary, which has been fueled by a "mindset that if we disagree, we have to disqualify each other."

END OF SUMMARY.
