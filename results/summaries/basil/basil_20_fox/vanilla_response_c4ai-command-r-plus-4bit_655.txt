SUMMARY: Rick Santorum, the new frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, sparked controversy by referring to President Obama's "phony theology" and suggesting that the President prioritizes the environment over people. Santorum clarified that he wasn't questioning Obama's Christian faith but rather challenging his environmental policies, which Santorum believes place the Earth above human welfare. He accused Obama of having a "world view that elevates the Earth above man" and using global warming claims to centralize power. Obama's campaign staff strongly criticized Santorum's comments as destructive and divisive, arguing that they reflect a negative and pessimistic tone prevalent in the Republican primary campaign. Robert Gibbs, the president's former press secretary, called for an end to such rhetoric and a focus on policy debates instead. Santorum, however, stood by his remarks, insisting that he was critiquing the President's approach to environmental issues and not his faith. END OF SUMMARY.
