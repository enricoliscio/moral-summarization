SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum clarified his statement about President Obama's "phony theology", saying he was not questioning the President's Christianity, but rather challenging his environmental policies. Santorum believes that Obama's policies prioritize the Earth's welfare over human well-being, which he considers a "radical environmentalist" view. He argued that humans should use the Earth's resources wisely, but not serve the Earth. The Obama campaign responded strongly, calling Santorum's remark a personal affront and an attack on the President's character and faith. They claimed it was part of a pattern of negativity and ugliness in the Republican primary campaign. Santorum maintained that he was only criticizing Obama's worldview, not his faith, and that he believes Obama is a Christian. The exchange highlights the increasingly heated rhetoric in the presidential campaign.
