SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum clarified his statement about President Obama's "phony theology," saying he wasn't questioning the president's Christianity, but rather challenging his environmental policies. Santorum believes that Obama's views prioritize the Earth's welfare over human well-being, which he considers a "radical environmentalist" perspective. The Obama campaign responded strongly, calling Santorum's remark a personal affront and an attack on the president's character and faith. Santorum maintained that he was referring to Obama's "world view" that elevates the Earth above human needs, citing the politicization of global warming as an example. He reiterated that he accepts Obama as a Christian, but disagrees with his approach to problems. The exchange highlights the divisive tone of the GOP primary, with Obama's campaign accusing Santorum of nastiness and distortions.
