SUMMARY: Rick Santorum has come under fire for his recent comments about President Obama's "phony theology," with the Obama campaign calling his remarks "destructive" and "over the line." Santorum has denied questioning the president's Christian faith, instead attributing his comments to a disagreement with Obama's environmental policies, which he believes place the Earth above human welfare. The former senator from Pennsylvania claimed that Obama's worldview is not based on the Bible and that the president is focused on centralizing power and politicizing issues like global warming. Robert Gibbs, a former press secretary for Obama, criticized Santorum's remarks as a "race to the bottom," highlighting the divisiveness and negativity that has characterized the Republican primary campaign. Santorum's comments come at a time when he has pulled ahead of Mitt Romney in polling for the 2012 Republican presidential primary nod.
END OF SUMMARY.
