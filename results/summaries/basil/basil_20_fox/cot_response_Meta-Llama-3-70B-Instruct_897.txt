SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum clarified that his comment about President Obama's "phony theology" was not questioning the President's Christianity, but rather challenging his environmental policies that prioritize the Earth over human welfare. Santorum believes that humans should use the Earth's resources wisely, but not serve the Earth. He accused Obama of having a "radical environmentalist" worldview that elevates the Earth above man, which he thinks is "wrong" and "destructive". The Obama campaign responded strongly, calling Santorum's remark a "personal affront" and saying it's time to focus on policy debates rather than questioning each other's character and faith. Santorum's comment was seen as part of a larger trend of "nastiness", "divisiveness", and "ugliness" in the GOP primary. END OF SUMMARY.
