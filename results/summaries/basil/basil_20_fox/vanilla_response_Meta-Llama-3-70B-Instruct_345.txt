SUMMARY:

Rick Santorum clarified his comment about President Obama's "phony theology", stating that he was not questioning the President's Christianity, but rather challenging his environmental policies. Santorum believes that Obama's approach prioritizes the Earth's welfare over human well-being, which he disagrees with. He argues that humans should use the Earth's resources wisely, but not serve the Earth. The Obama campaign responded strongly, calling Santorum's remark a personal affront and an attack on the President's character and faith. Santorum maintained that he was referring to Obama's "world view" that elevates the Earth above human needs, and not questioning his faith. The exchange highlights the increasing negativity and divisiveness in the GOP primary race.

END OF SUMMARY.
