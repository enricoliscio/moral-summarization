SUMMARY: Rick Santorum, the new frontrunner in the GOP race, made controversial remarks about President Obama's "phony theology," suggesting that the President prioritizes the environment over people's welfare. Santorum clarified that he was not questioning Obama's Christian faith but was challenging his environmental policies, which he believes place the Earth above human welfare. He accused Obama of centralizing power and giving more control to the government under the guise of environmental stewardship. The Obama campaign, through former press secretary Robert Gibbs and deputy press secretary Ben Labolt, strongly condemned Santorum's remarks as destructive and offensive, calling for a more respectful and issue-based campaign. Santorum defended his use of the word "theology," referring to a worldview that elevates the Earth above man, and reiterated his belief that Obama is a Christian. Gibbs expressed disappointment in the GOP primary campaign's negative tone and divisiveness. Santorum's comments highlight the tension between environmental concerns and economic priorities, with Santorum accusing Obama of neglecting the latter.
END OF SUMMARY.
