SUMMARY:
Rick Santorum clarified that he wasn't questioning President Obama's Christianity when he referred to his "phony theology." Instead, Santorum was challenging policies that prioritize the stewardship of the Earth over human welfare. He believes that man is meant to use the Earth's resources wisely, not serve the Earth. Santorum called this "radical environmentalist" view "phony" and "wrong." The Obama campaign responded forcefully, calling the remark a "personal affront" and "destructive." They accused Santorum of engaging in "ugliness" and "negativity" and said it's time to focus on policy debates, not personal attacks. Santorum maintained that he was targeting Obama's "world view" that elevates the Earth above man, which he believes is "not scientifically proven." The exchange highlights the "nastiness" and "divisiveness" of the GOP primary. END OF SUMMARY.
