Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the House Intelligence Committee Republicans calling for Adam Schiff to resign as chairman because of his comments on the Russia investigation. Schiff believes there was collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, even though the Mueller report didn't directly implicate Trump. The Republicans accused him of promoting a false narrative and linked him to leaks. Trump also tweeted about Schiff lying and leaking info, suggesting he should be forced out. The Mueller report didn't exonerate Trump, and Democrats are pushing for its release. Schiff defended his stance, saying it's unethical and unpatriotic not to question the investigation.

Okay, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should start by mentioning the nine Republicans urging Schiff's resignation. Highlight Schiff's belief in collusion despite Mueller's findings. Then, the accusations from the GOP, including promoting a false narrative and leaking info. Mention Trump's tweet supporting their call. Note that Mueller's report didn't clear Trump, and Democrats want the report released. Finally, Schiff's response, emphasizing the importance of questioning the findings.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, captures all key points, and stays within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each important detail is included without being too verbose.
