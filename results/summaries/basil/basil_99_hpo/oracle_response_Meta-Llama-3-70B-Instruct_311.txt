SUMMARY:

The nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are demanding Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman, accusing him of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" about the Trump campaign's collusion with Russia. Despite the Mueller report's findings, Schiff maintains that there was "undoubtedly" collusion and plans to continue investigating counterintelligence issues. The GOP members claim Schiff's actions are "incompatible" with his duty as chairman, citing his "willingness" to promote a false narrative and accusing him of "lying" and "leaking" information. Trump himself called for Schiff's resignation, labeling his actions "unlawfully lying and leaking." Schiff fired back, calling the president's behavior "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic," and evidence of "corrupt" collusion. The Democrats are uniformly calling for the full Mueller report to be released publicly, as questions about its findings remain.

END OF SUMMARY.
