Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points and the underlying tone.

The article is about nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign. They're upset because Schiff believes there was collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, despite the Mueller report not directly implicating Trump. Schiff is standing firm, stating that collusion is undeniable and that there are still counterintelligence issues to investigate.

The Republicans are accusing Schiff of promoting a false narrative, even linking him to leaked information. They argue his actions are incompatible with his role as chairman. Trump also weighed in, calling Schiff a liar and suggesting he should be forced out of Congress. Meanwhile, the Mueller report neither exonerates Trump nor finds him guilty, leaving Democrats wanting the full report released.

I need to capture the moral elements here. Schiff is portrayed as someone who's sticking to his beliefs despite the report's findings, which could be seen as principled but also as ignoring the facts. The Republicans and Trump are framing Schiff's actions as unethical and misleading, which adds a moral judgment to the situation.

I should structure the summary to include all these points concisely, making sure to highlight the moral framing from both sides. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows well, ending with the summary token as specified.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and captures the essence without losing the moral aspects. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and make sure the key points are all included.
