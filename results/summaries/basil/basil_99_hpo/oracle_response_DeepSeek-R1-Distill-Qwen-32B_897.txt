Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman. They're upset because Schiff keeps saying there was collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, even though Mueller's report didn't find that. 

The author used several morally charged words like collusion, investigate, compromised, leaked, lying, unethical, etc. I need to make sure my summary includes as many of these as possible without making it too long, just under 200 words.

First, I'll outline the main points: Republicans want Schiff to resign because he's promoting the idea of collusion despite Mueller's findings. They accused him of being part of a media campaign and leaking info. Schiff defended his stance, calling it immoral and unethical. The Mueller report didn't exonerate Trump but also didn't find a crime. Democrats want the full report released. The Republicans argue Schiff's actions are incompatible with his role as chairman.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these points, using the moral terms. I'll start by stating the Republicans' demand for Schiff's resignation over his comments. Then mention their accusations of a media campaign and leaking. Next, include Schiff's defense using words like immoral, unethical, etc. Then, note the Mueller report's findings and the Democrats' call for the report's release. Finally, the Republicans' argument about Schiff's incompatibility as chairman.

I need to make sure each sentence flows and includes the necessary moral terms without making it sound forced. Let me check the word count as I go to stay under 200 words. I'll also ensure that the summary captures the essence of the conflict and the moral framing used by the author.

SUMMARY: All nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have demanded Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) resign as chairman, accusing him of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" about collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Despite the Mueller investigation not finding evidence of collusion, Schiff insists there was "undoubtedly" collusion and continues to investigate whether the president or his associates were compromised by a foreign power. The GOP members claim Schiff is part of a media campaign and have linked him to leaked information, calling his actions "alarming." Trump also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "unlawfully lying and leaking." The Republicans argue that Mueller's findings "conclusively refute" Schiff's assertions, though the report neither exonerated Trump nor found him guilty of a crime. Schiff, however, maintains his stance, labeling his critics' actions as "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," and "corrupt." Democrats are pushing for the full Mueller report to be released. The Republicans argue Schiff's actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman, emphasizing the need for effective oversight of the intelligence community. END OF SUMMARY.
