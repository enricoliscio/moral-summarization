SUMMARY:
House Intelligence Committee Republicans are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman over his comments about the Russia investigation. Schiff has maintained his belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, despite the investigation finding no evidence of conspiracy. The Republicans accuse Schiff of promoting a *false narrative*, suggesting he is *immoral*, *unethical*, *unpatriotic*, and *corrupt*. They claim his actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman and call for his resignation from Congress. Schiff, however, defends his position, arguing that the actions of the Trump campaign are *immoral*, *unethical*, *unpatriotic*, and evidence of *collusion*. The dispute highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the Mueller report and the question of potential foreign influence on the Trump administration.
