SUMMARY:

Nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman, accusing him of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" about the Trump campaign's collusion with Russia. Despite the Mueller report's findings, Schiff maintains that there was "undoubtedly" collusion and plans to continue investigating counterintelligence issues. The GOP members claim Schiff's actions are "incompatible" with his duty as chairman, citing his "willingness to continue to promote" a false narrative and accusing him of "lying" and "leaking" information. They argue that Schiff's actions are "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." Trump himself has joined the chorus, calling on Schiff to resign and accusing him of "unlawfully lying and leaking" information. Schiff has doubled down on his criticism, calling the president's actions "corrupt" and "evidence of collusion." The dispute highlights the ongoing controversy over the Russia investigation and the role of the Intelligence Committee in providing oversight of the intelligence community.
