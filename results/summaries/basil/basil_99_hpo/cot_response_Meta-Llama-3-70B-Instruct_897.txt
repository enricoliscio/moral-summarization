SUMMARY:
Nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to resign as chairman due to his continued claims of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite the Mueller investigation's findings. Schiff maintains that there is "undoubtedly" collusion and plans to continue investigating counterintelligence issues. The GOP committee members accuse Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" and engaging in "unlawfully lying and leaking" information. They argue that his actions are "incompatible" with his duty as chairman and are "alarming." Schiff responds by calling the investigation's outcome "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," and "corrupt," and evidence of collusion. The controversy highlights the deepening partisan divide over the Russia investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
