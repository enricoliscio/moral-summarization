SUMMARY:
The House Intelligence Committee's Republican members are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman due to his persistent belief in collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia despite the conclusion of the Mueller investigation. They accuse Schiff of leading a "well-orchestrated media campaign" and contributing to leaks about the investigation. In response, Schiff stands firm, calling the situation "immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt," indicative of "collusion." The dispute highlights the stark divide between Republican and Democratic interpretations of Mueller's findings, with Republicans demanding Schiff's resignation and Democrats seeking the report's public release. The Republicans' letter condemns Schiff's actions as incompatible with his duty as chairman, responsible for overseeing the US intelligence community. END OF SUMMARY.
