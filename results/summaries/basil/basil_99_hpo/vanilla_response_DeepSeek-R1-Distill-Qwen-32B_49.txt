Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the House Intelligence Committee members calling for Adam Schiff to resign. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

The article starts by saying all nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are asking Schiff to resign because of his comments on the Russia investigation. Schiff believes there was collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, even though Mueller's report didn't directly implicate Trump. The Republicans accuse him of promoting a false narrative and being part of a media campaign. They also linked him to leaked information. Trump himself tweeted, calling Schiff a liar and saying he should be forced out.

Schiff's response was to defend his stance, saying it's immoral and unethical to not investigate further. The article also mentions that Mueller's report didn't clear Trump but didn't find a crime. Democrats want the full report released.

So, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: the Republicans' demand for Schiff's resignation, his stance on collusion, their accusations, Trump's tweet, Schiff's defense, and the implications of Mueller's report.

I need to make sure it's concise and covers all main aspects without getting too detailed. Maybe start with the Republicans' action, then Schiff's position, their accusations, Trump's involvement, Schiff's response, and the outcome of the Mueller report.

I should also note that Democrats are pushing for the full report's release. That's an important point because it shows the ongoing divide and the next steps in the issue.

Let me structure it step by step:

1. Introduction: Republicans call for Schiff's resignation.
2. Reason: Schiff's comments on Russia investigation despite Mueller's findings.
3. Schiff's stance: Believes in collusion, continues investigation.
4. Republicans' accusations: False narrative, media campaign, leaking info.
5. Trump's involvement: Tweets about Schiff lying and leaking.
6. Schiff's response: Defends his position, calls it immoral not to investigate.
7. Mueller's report: Doesn't exonerate Trump, doesn't find a crime.
8. Democrats' stance: Want full report released.

Now, I'll try to put this together in a concise manner, making sure each point is covered without exceeding the word limit.
