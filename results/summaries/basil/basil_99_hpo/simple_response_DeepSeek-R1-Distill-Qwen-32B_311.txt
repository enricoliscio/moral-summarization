Okay, I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave. So first, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the underlying moral perspectives.

The article is about nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman. Their reason is his public comments about the Russia investigation, which didn't find that Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. Schiff believes there was collusion, and he's continuing to investigate counterintelligence issues. The Republicans are accusing him of promoting a false narrative and linking him to leaked information. They also mention Mueller's report, which didn't exonerate Trump but didn't find a crime either. Schiff is doubling down, calling the situation immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt.

I need to capture the conflict between Schiff's stance and the Republicans' accusations. The moral framing here is about truthfulness, integrity, and duty. Schiff is portrayed as committed to uncovering the truth, while the Republicans are seen as trying to suppress it or protect Trump. The summary should reflect this tension.

I should also include that the Republicans argue Schiff's actions are incompatible with his role as chairman. Trump himself has weighed in, calling for Schiff's resignation. Democrats, on the other hand, are pushing for the full Mueller report's release.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: the Republicans' call for Schiff's resignation, their accusations, Schiff's response, Mueller's findings, and the broader implications regarding the investigation and political divides.

I should structure it to first state the Republicans' demand, their reasons, Schiff's counterarguments, and the context of Mueller's report. Then, mention the political implications and the ongoing debate.

I need to ensure the summary is concise but includes all key elements without losing the moral perspective. Avoiding any personal bias, just presenting the facts as they are framed in the article.

Now, putting it all together, I'll start with the Republicans' demand, mention their accusations, include Schiff's strong statements, reference Mueller's report, and conclude with the political divide and ongoing calls for transparency.

Schiff has maintained his belief in collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite the Mueller report not directly implicating Trump. The Republicans argue Schiff's actions are incompatible with his role as chairman, linking him to leaked information and media campaigns. Schiff counters that the situation is "immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt," emphasizing the need for transparency. Mueller's report neither exonerated Trump nor found a crime, leaving questions unresolved. Democrats call for the full report's release, highlighting the ongoing political divide over the investigation's implications. END OF SUMMARY.
