Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The article is about nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman. They're upset because Schiff continues to assert that there was collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, even though the Mueller report didn't find direct evidence of that. 

Schiff maintains his belief, saying there's undoubtedly collusion and that they'll continue investigating. The Republicans accuse him of promoting a false narrative and link him to leaked information. They argue that Mueller's findings refute Schiff's claims, but Mueller's report actually doesn't exonerate Trump either. Democrats are pushing for the full report's release. Schiff responds by doubling down, calling the situation immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic, and pointing out that Mueller indicted several people close to Trump.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these points: Schiff's stance, the Republicans' accusations, Mueller's findings, the Democrats' call for the report's release, and Schiff's strong response. Also, I should keep the moral framing intact, highlighting the accusations of lying, promoting a false narrative, and Schiff's own moral condemnations.

Let me structure this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start with the Republicans' call for Schiff's resignation, mention his comments, the Mueller report's findings, the Republicans' accusations, Mueller's stance, Democrats' actions, and Schiff's response. I need to make sure each point is clear and the moral elements are emphasized.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented in the article. Also, I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all key aspects without being too detailed. Let me check the word count to make sure it's within the limit.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure it's accurate and captures the moral framing as intended. I'll make sure the summary starts with the Republicans' demand, explains Schiff's position, the Republicans' accusations, Mueller's findings, the Democrats' stance, and Schiff's response. That should cover all necessary points succinctly.
