SUMMARY:

Nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are demanding Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman, accusing him of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" about the Trump-Russia connection. Despite the Mueller report's findings, Schiff maintains that there was "undoubtedly" collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The GOP members claim Schiff's "willingness to continue to promote" this narrative is "alarming" and "misleadingly" ignores the report's conclusions. They accuse him of "lying and leaking" information and being "compromised" by his own biases. Trump himself called for Schiff's resignation, labeling him "corrupt" and "unpatriotic." Schiff, however, remains committed to investigating the "counterintelligence issues" and ensuring the president is not compromised by a "hostile foreign power." He deems it "immoral" and "unethical" to ignore these concerns. The moral divide between Schiff and his critics could not be clearer.

END OF SUMMARY.
