Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. They provided a list of morally charged words that should be included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee demanding Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation because of his comments on the Russia investigation. Schiff believes there was collusion, but the Mueller report didn't find direct evidence. The Republicans are accusing him of promoting a false narrative and leaking information, calling his actions unethical and unpatriotic.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral words intact. I should make sure to include terms like collusion, investigate, compromised, leaked, promote, narrative, lying, unethical, etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflict between Schiff and the Republicans, their accusations, and the implications of their actions.

I also need to keep it under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll ensure that the summary flows logically, covering Schiff's stance, the Republicans' accusations, and the moral terms used by both sides.

SUMMARY: Nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have called for Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to resign as chairman, accusing him of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" about collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Schiff, who maintains that collusion occurred, has criticized the Mueller report for not addressing whether the president or his associates were compromised by a foreign power. The GOP members claim Schiff is at the center of a media campaign and has leaked information, labeling his actions as "alarming" and incompatible with his duty as chairman. They argue Mueller's findings "conclusively refute" Schiff's assertions, though Mueller neither exonerated Trump nor concluded he committed a crime. Schiff, in response, accused the committee of being unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt, emphasizing the need to investigate the counterintelligence issues further. The Republicans' letter also criticized Schiff for failing to provide proper oversight, while Democrats advocate for the full Mueller report to be released. Schiff has doubled down on his claims, calling the situation "immoral" and "unethical." END OF SUMMARY.
