SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Republicans are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman over his public statements about the Russia investigation. Schiff has repeatedly expressed his belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, despite the recent conclusion of the Mueller investigation, which did not find evidence of conspiracy. Schiff maintains that there is still collusion and that Trump or his associates may be compromised by a hostile foreign power. The Republicans accuse Schiff of promoting a false narrative and being part of a media campaign to spread misinformation. They claim that his actions are immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. Schiff, however, stands by his position, arguing that the actions of Trump and his associates are immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt. He vows to continue investigating the counterintelligence issues surrounding the Trump campaign and potential Russian involvement.
END OF SUMMARY.
