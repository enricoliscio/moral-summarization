SUMMARY:

Nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman, accusing him of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" about the Trump campaign's collusion with Russia. Despite the Mueller report's findings, Schiff maintains that there was "undoubtedly" collusion and plans to continue investigating counterintelligence issues. The GOP members claim Schiff is at the center of a "well-orchestrated media campaign" and has a "willingness" to promote a false narrative, which they find "alarming". They also accuse him of "lying" and "leaking" information. Trump himself has called for Schiff's resignation, saying he should be "forced" to step down from Congress. Schiff has doubled down on his questions about the investigation, calling it "immoral", "unethical", "unpatriotic", and "corrupt". The GOP members argue that Schiff's actions are "incompatible" with his duty as chairman, which includes providing "effective oversight" of the intelligence community.
