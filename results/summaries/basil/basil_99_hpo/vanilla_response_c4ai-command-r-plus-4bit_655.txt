SUMMARY: Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee's Democratic chairman, to resign over his comments about the Russia investigation. Schiff has repeatedly expressed his belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, despite the investigation concluding without finding evidence of conspiracy. In a letter, the GOP committee members accused Schiff of promoting false narratives and being connected to leaked information. They claim that Mueller's findings refute Schiff's assertions, although the report does not fully exonerate the President. Schiff has defended his stance, stating that the actions of the Trump campaign are "immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt." Trump himself has also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of lying and leaking information.
END OF SUMMARY.
