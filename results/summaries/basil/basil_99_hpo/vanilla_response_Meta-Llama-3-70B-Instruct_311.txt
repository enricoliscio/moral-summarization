SUMMARY:

Nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to resign as chairman due to his continued claims of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite the Mueller report's findings. Schiff maintains that there is "undoubtedly" collusion and plans to continue investigating counterintelligence issues. The GOP committee members accuse Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" and linking him to leaked information about the investigation. President Trump also demanded Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "unlawfully lying and leaking" information. Schiff responded by doubling down on his questions about the investigation, calling it "immoral," "unethical," and "corrupt." The controversy surrounds the release of the full Mueller report, with Democrats calling for its public release.

END OF SUMMARY.
