Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand what's going on.

The article is about nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee calling for Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman, to resign. They're upset because Schiff has been saying that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, even though the Mueller investigation didn't find direct evidence of that. The Republicans are accusing Schiff of promoting a false narrative and even link him to leaked information. They also mention Trump himself tweeting that Schiff should resign, calling him a liar and a leaker.

The article notes that Mueller's report didn't find Trump guilty but also didn't exonerate him. Democrats are still pushing for the full report to be released. Schiff, in response, stands by his claims, calling the situation immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic.

So, the moral framing here is about truthfulness, integrity, and duty. The Republicans are accusing Schiff of spreading false information, which they see as unethical. Schiff, on the other hand, is framing their actions as corrupt and unethical.

I need to make sure the summary captures this conflict, highlighting both sides' accusations and the underlying moral arguments. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and focus on the key points: the Republicans' demand for Schiff's resignation, their accusations, Schiff's response, and the broader context of the Mueller report.

I should also mention that the Republicans are tying Schiff to a media campaign and leaking, while Schiff is accusing them of corruption. It's important to note the moral language used by both sides to emphasize the framing.

Let me structure the summary: start with the Republicans' demand, their reasons, then Schiff's response, including his moral stance. Mention the Mueller report's findings and the Democrats' call for the full report release. Keep each part brief but informative.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the Republicans' action, their accusations, Schiff's defense and moral arguments, and the implications of the Mueller report. I should avoid getting bogged down in too many details, just hit the main points.

Also, make sure to use the correct titles and positions, like "House Intelligence Committee chairman" and "special counsel Robert Mueller." Keep the language clear and straightforward, preserving the moral elements without bias.

Alright, I think I have a good outline. Time to put it all together in a concise summary.

SUMMARY: Nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have demanded that Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) resign, accusing him of promoting a "false narrative" about collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Schiff, who has consistently maintained that collusion occurred, despite the Mueller investigation not directly implicating Trump, has faced criticism from Republicans, who claim his actions are incompatible with his role as chairman. The GOP members also linked Schiff to leaked information, calling his behavior "alarming" and urging his removal. President Trump joined the call, tweeting that Schiff should be "forced" to step down, accusing him of "lying and leaking." Meanwhile, Schiff defended his stance, labeling the situation "immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic," and emphasizing the need for continued oversight. The Mueller report neither exonerated nor found Trump guilty, leaving questions unresolved, with Democrats pushing for its full release. The conflict highlights competing claims of integrity and duty in the context of the Russia investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
