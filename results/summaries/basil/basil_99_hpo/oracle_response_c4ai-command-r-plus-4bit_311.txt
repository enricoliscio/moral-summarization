SUMMARY: Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are demanding that Rep. Adam Schiff resign as chairman over his comments on the Russia investigation. Schiff has maintained his belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, despite the probe finding no direct evidence of conspiracy. The Republicans accuse Schiff of promoting a false narrative and being linked to leaked information. They claim his actions are immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. Schiff, however, stands by his position, questioning the ethics of the Trump campaign's actions and highlighting the importance of continuing to investigate potential counterintelligence issues and compromised individuals. The special counsel's report neither concludes that the President committed a crime nor exonerates him, leaving Democrats seeking a public release of the full report. The Republicans conclude that Schiff's actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman, responsible for oversight of the intelligence community.
END OF SUMMARY.
