SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Republicans are calling for Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" about Trump-Russia collusion. Despite the Mueller report's findings, Schiff maintains that "undoubtedly there is collusion" and vows to continue investigating counterintelligence issues. Republicans claim Schiff's actions are "incompatible with his duty" as chairman, citing his "willingness to continue to promote" a false narrative and accusing him of "lying and leaking" information. Trump himself tweeted that Schiff should be "forced" to resign from Congress. Schiff responded, calling the Republicans' actions "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic," and arguing that it's corrupt to ignore the investigation's findings. The dispute centers on the report's conclusions, with Republicans claiming it "conclusively refutes" Schiff's assertions, while Democrats argue it "does not exonerate" Trump.

END OF SUMMARY.
