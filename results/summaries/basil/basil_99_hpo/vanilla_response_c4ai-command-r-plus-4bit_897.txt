SUMMARY: All nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have called for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman due to his public comments about the Russia investigation. Schiff has maintained his belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, despite the investigation concluding no direct evidence of collusion. The Republicans accuse Schiff of promoting false narratives and being part of a media campaign to spread misinformation. They also allege that he has leaked information about the investigation. In response, Schiff has doubled down on his concerns about the ethics and patriotism of those involved in the investigation, stating that their actions are immoral and unpatriotic. The committee members' letter concludes that Schiff's actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman, while Democrats push for the Justice Department to release the full Mueller report publicly.
END OF SUMMARY.
