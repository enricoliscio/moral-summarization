SUMMARY:

The nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman, accusing him of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" about the Trump campaign's collusion with Russia. Despite the Mueller report's findings, Schiff maintains that there was undoubtedly collusion and that the president or those around him may be compromised by a hostile foreign power. The GOP committee members claim that Schiff's comments are incompatible with his duty as chairman, and Trump himself has called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "unlawfully lying and leaking" information. Schiff, however, has doubled down on his concerns, calling the investigation's outcome "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," and "corrupt." The moral framing of this issue is clear: Schiff's commitment to uncovering the truth and holding those in power accountable is being attacked by those who seek to obscure the facts and protect the president.

END OF SUMMARY.
