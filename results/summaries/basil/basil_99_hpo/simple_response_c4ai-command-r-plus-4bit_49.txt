SUMMARY: All nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman due to his persistent belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election, despite the recent conclusion of the Mueller investigation finding no evidence of such collusion. Schiff has maintained his stance, citing the indictment of individuals close to Trump and expressing concern about potential compromise by a hostile foreign power. The Republicans accuse Schiff of promoting false narratives and being linked to leaked information. They view his actions as incompatible with his duty as chairman, which involves overseeing the US intelligence community. Schiff, in response, characterizes the situation as immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic, reflecting his strong stance on the matter.

END OF SUMMARY.
