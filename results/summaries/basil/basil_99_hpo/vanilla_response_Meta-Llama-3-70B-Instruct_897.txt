SUMMARY:

All nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to resign as chairman due to his public comments about the Russia investigation. Despite the Mueller report not finding direct evidence of Trump's campaign colluding with Russia, Schiff maintains that there was collusion. The GOP committee members accuse Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" and linking him to leaked information about the investigation. President Trump also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "unlawfully lying and leaking" information. Schiff responded by doubling down on his questions about the investigation, calling it "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," and "corrupt." The GOP committee members argue that Schiff's actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman, while Democrats are calling for the full Mueller report to be released publicly.

END OF SUMMARY.
