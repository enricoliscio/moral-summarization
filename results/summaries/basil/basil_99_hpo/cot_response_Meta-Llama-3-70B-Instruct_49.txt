SUMMARY:
The nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to resign as chairman due to his public comments about the Russia investigation. Schiff maintains that there was "undoubtedly" collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite the Mueller report's findings. The GOP committee members accuse Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" and engaging in "unlawful lying and leaking" of information. They claim his actions are "incompatible" with his duty as chairman. Schiff responds by doubling down on his questions about the investigation, calling the president's actions "immoral", "unethical", "unpatriotic", and "corrupt". The controversy highlights the ongoing debate over the Russia investigation and the release of the full Mueller report. Schiff's critics demand his ouster, while he remains committed to uncovering the truth. END OF SUMMARY.
