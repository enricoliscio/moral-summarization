Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify all the morally charged words. Let me read through the article again.

The article talks about Rep. Schiff and the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. The key points are Schiff's comments about collusion, the Republicans accusing him of promoting a false narrative, and Trump's tweet about him lying and leaking. Schiff's response includes words like "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," "corrupt," and "collusion."

So, the morally framed words I identified are: "collusion," "false narrative," "alarming," "unlawfully lying," "leaking," "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," "corrupt," and "evidence of collusion."

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise. I'll start by stating the main action: the nine Republicans are calling for Schiff's resignation. Then, mention Schiff's belief in collusion despite Mueller's report. Highlight the Republicans' accusations about the false narrative and leaking. Include Trump's tweet about lying and leaking. Then, note Schiff's strong response using the moral terms. Finally, mention the Democrats' stance on releasing the full Mueller report.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays under 200 words. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each moral term is included where appropriate.

**SUMMARY:**
All nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have demanded Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman, citing his insistence on the existence of "collusion" between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite the Mueller report not directly implicating President Trump. The Republicans accused Schiff of promoting a "false narrative" and linked him to leaked information, calling his actions "alarming." President Trump also tweeted that Schiff was "unlawfully lying and leaking" and should be forced out of Congress. Schiff defended his stance, describing the situation as "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," and "corrupt," emphasizing the need to investigate further. Democrats are pushing for the full Mueller report's release. END OF SUMMARY.
