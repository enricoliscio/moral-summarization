SUMMARY: All nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman over his comments on the Russia investigation. Schiff has maintained his belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, despite the investigation finding no evidence of conspiracy. The Republicans accuse Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" and being part of a media campaign to smear the President. They claim his actions are "immoral", "unethical", and "unpatriotic", and that he is "compromised" and "corrupt". Schiff, however, stands by his questions about the probe, which indicted over 30 individuals close to Trump. He believes that the President's actions are a threat to national security and that his refusal to acknowledge any wrongdoing is evidence of collusion. 

END OF SUMMARY.
