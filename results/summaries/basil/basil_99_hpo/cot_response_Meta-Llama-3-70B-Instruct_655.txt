SUMMARY:
Nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to resign as chairman due to his continued claims of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite the Mueller report's findings. Schiff maintains that there is "undoubtedly" collusion and vows to continue investigating counterintelligence issues. The GOP committee members accuse Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" and engaging in "unlawful lying and leaking" of information. They claim his actions are "incompatible" with his duty as chairman. Schiff responds, calling the investigation's outcome "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," and "corrupt," and evidence of collusion. The dispute highlights the ongoing partisan divide over the Russia investigation and its findings. END OF SUMMARY.
