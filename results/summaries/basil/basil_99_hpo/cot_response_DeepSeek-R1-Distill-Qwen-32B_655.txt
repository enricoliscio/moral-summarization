Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided a detailed article about the conflict between Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee and Rep. Adam Schiff regarding the Russia investigation.

First, I have to identify all the morally framed words. These are words that carry a strong ethical or moral connotation. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "collusion," "counterintelligence," "false," "alarming," "unlawfully lying," "leaking," "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," "corrupt," and "evidence of collusion." These words are crucial because they reflect the moral stance each side is taking.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these moral terms as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the essence of the conflict. I'll start by stating that nine Republicans are demanding Schiff's resignation over his comments about the Russia investigation. I'll mention his belief in collusion despite Mueller's report not implicating Trump. Then, I'll include the Republicans' accusations about promoting a false narrative and leaking information. I'll also note Trump's tweet about Schiff lying and leaking, and the Democrats' call for the full Mueller report's release. Finally, I'll highlight Schiff's defense, emphasizing his moral concerns about the investigation.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, connecting each point without being too verbose. I'll also ensure that the moral framing words are included to reflect the original article's tone. Let me piece this together step by step, keeping an eye on the word count to stay within the limit.
