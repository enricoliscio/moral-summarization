SUMMARY:

All 9 Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to resign as chairman due to his public comments about the Russia investigation. Schiff maintains that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite the Mueller report not finding direct evidence. The GOP committee members accuse Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" and linking him to leaked information. President Trump also demanded Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "unlawfully lying and leaking" information. Schiff refuses to back down, calling the Trump campaign's actions "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," and "corrupt." Democrats are pushing for the full Mueller report to be released publicly, as questions remain about its findings.

END OF SUMMARY.
