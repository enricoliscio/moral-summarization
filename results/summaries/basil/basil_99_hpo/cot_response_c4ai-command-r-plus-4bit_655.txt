SUMMARY: 
The Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have called for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman over his public statements regarding the Russia investigation. Schiff has consistently expressed his belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia despite the investigation's conclusion that there was no evidence of conspiracy. The Republicans accuse Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" and allege that he has unlawfully leaked information to the media. They argue that Mueller's findings refute Schiff's assertions and claim that his actions are immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. Schiff, however, defends his position, questioning the morality, ethics, and patriotism of the Trump campaign's actions, which he believes constitute collusion and corruption. The dispute highlights the ongoing partisan divide over the investigation's conclusions, with Democrats demanding the full release of Mueller's report to address lingering concerns. The Republicans' letter concludes that Schiff's conduct is incompatible with his duty as chairman, responsible for overseeing the U.S. intelligence community.
