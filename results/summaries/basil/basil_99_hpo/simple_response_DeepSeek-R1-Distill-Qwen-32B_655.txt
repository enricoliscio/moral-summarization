Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

The article talks about nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman. They're upset because Schiff made public comments about the Russia investigation, which didn't find that Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. Schiff believes there was collusion and continues to investigate counterintelligence issues. The Republicans accuse him of promoting a false narrative and link him to leaked information. Trump also tweeted, calling Schiff a liar and suggesting he should be forced out of Congress. The article mentions Mueller's report didn't exonerate Trump but also didn't find him guilty. Democrats want the full report released. Schiff defends his stance, calling the situation immoral and unethical.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects. I should highlight the Republicans' accusations, Schiff's stance, Trump's involvement, and the implications of the Mueller report. I'll make sure to include the moral terms like "immoral," "unethical," and "corrupt" as Schiff used them. Also, note the political divide and the call for the report's release.

Let me structure the summary: Start with the Republicans' demand for Schiff's resignation, mention his belief in collusion despite Mueller's findings, the accusations from the GOP, Trump's tweet, the Mueller report's conclusions, Democrats' call for the report's release, and Schiff's defense with moral language.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll combine sentences where possible without losing the moral framing. Make sure to include all key elements without exceeding the word limit.

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) resign as chairman, accusing him of promoting a "false narrative" about the Russia investigation. Schiff, who believes the Trump campaign colluded with Russia despite the probe not implicating Trump, has faced criticism for his continued assertions. The GOP members claim Schiff is part of a media campaign and linked to leaked information, calling his actions "alarming" and incompatible with his role. President Trump also tweeted, accusing Schiff of "lying and leaking" and suggesting he be forced out of Congress. While Mueller's report did not find Trump guilty, it also did not exonerate him, leaving questions unresolved. Democrats call for the full report's release.
