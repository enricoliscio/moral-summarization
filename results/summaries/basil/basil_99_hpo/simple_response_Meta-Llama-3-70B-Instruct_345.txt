SUMMARY:

Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman, accusing him of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" about Trump-Russia collusion. Despite the Mueller report's findings, Schiff maintains that there was collusion and plans to continue investigating counterintelligence issues. The GOP committee members claim that Schiff's actions are "incompatible" with his duty as chairman, and Trump has also demanded his resignation, accusing him of "unlawfully lying and leaking" information. Schiff, however, has doubled down on his concerns, calling it "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," and "corrupt" to ignore the investigation's findings. The moral framing of the article suggests that Schiff's pursuit of truth and accountability is being unfairly maligned by Republicans, who are trying to silence him and cover up the truth.
