SUMMARY: Nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman due to his public statements about the Russia investigation. Schiff has repeatedly expressed his belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, despite the investigation finding no evidence of conspiracy. Schiff maintains that there is still collusion and that Trump or his associates may be compromised by a hostile foreign power. The Republican committee members accuse Schiff of promoting a false narrative and being linked to leaked information. They argue that his actions are immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic, and that he is unfit to oversee the intelligence community. Schiff, however, stands by his position, questioning the ethics and legality of Trump's actions and calling for further investigation into potential wrongdoing. 

END OF SUMMARY.
