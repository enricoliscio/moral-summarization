Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the House Intelligence Committee. All nine Republican members are asking Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman, to resign. The reason is his public comments about the Russia investigation. The investigation didn't find that Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia, but Schiff still believes there was collusion.

Schiff told The Washington Post that there was definitely collusion and that they'll keep looking into counterintelligence issues, like whether Trump or his associates were compromised by a foreign power. He pointed out that Mueller's report didn't address that.

The Republicans wrote a letter saying Schiff is part of a media campaign promoting a false narrative about Trump and Russia. They even linked him to leaked information. They called his actions alarming and incompatible with his role as chairman. Trump also tweeted, accusing Schiff of lying and leaking, and said he should resign.

The article mentions that Mueller's report didn't find Trump guilty but also didn't exonerate him. Democrats want the full report released. Schiff defended his stance, saying it's immoral and unethical not to question the investigation, especially since it indicted people close to Trump.

So, the summary needs to capture the conflict between Schiff and the Republicans, their reasons, and the broader implications. I'll make sure to include key points: Schiff's belief in collusion despite Mueller's findings, the Republicans' accusations, Trump's tweet, Mueller's ambiguous conclusions, and Schiff's defense.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. Let me put it all together.
