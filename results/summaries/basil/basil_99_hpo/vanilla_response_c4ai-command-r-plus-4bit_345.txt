SUMMARY: Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman due to his public comments expressing strong belief in collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite the conclusion of the Mueller investigation finding no evidence of conspiracy. Schiff has stated that he believes there was collusion and that Trump or those around him may be compromised by a hostile foreign power. The Republicans accuse Schiff of promoting false narratives and being involved in leaking information, demanding his resignation from Congress. They argue that his actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman of the committee responsible for overseeing the intelligence community. Schiff has defended his position, stating that he finds Trump's actions immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic.
