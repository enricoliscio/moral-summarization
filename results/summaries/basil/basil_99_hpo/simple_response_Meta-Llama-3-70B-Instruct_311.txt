SUMMARY:

The nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman due to his continued claims of Trump-Russia collusion despite the Mueller report's findings. Schiff maintains that there was undoubtedly collusion and plans to continue investigating counterintelligence issues. The GOP committee members accuse Schiff of promoting a false narrative and leaking information, which they deem "alarming" and "unlawful". Trump has also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "unlawfully lying and leaking" information. However, Schiff stands by his assertions, calling it "immoral", "unethical", "unpatriotic", and "corrupt" to dismiss the investigation's findings. The Democrats are uniformly demanding the release of the full report, as questions about its contents remain unanswered.

END OF SUMMARY.
