SUMMARY: Nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have called for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman due to his unwavering belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election, despite the conclusion of the Mueller investigation finding no evidence of conspiracy. Schiff has faced backlash for his public comments, with his critics accusing him of promoting a false narrative and unlawfully leaking information. In response, Schiff has defended his stance by questioning the ethics and morality of the situation, stating that he finds the actions immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt. The Intelligence Committee Republicans' letter concluded that Schiff's actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman, which is to provide effective oversight of the U.S. intelligence community. This controversy highlights the ongoing political divide and the continued investigation into possible Trump-Russia connections.
END OF SUMMARY.
