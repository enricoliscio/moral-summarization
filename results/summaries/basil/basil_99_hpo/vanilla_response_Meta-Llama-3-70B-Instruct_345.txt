SUMMARY:

Nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to resign as chairman, citing his public comments about the Russia investigation. Schiff maintains that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite the Mueller report's findings. The GOP committee members accuse Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" and linking him to leaked information about the investigation. President Trump also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "unlawfully lying and leaking" information. Schiff has doubled down on his questions about the investigation, calling it "immoral," "unethical," and "corrupt." The controversy surrounds Schiff's continued assertions of collusion despite the Mueller report's findings, which did not directly implicate President Trump.

END OF SUMMARY.
