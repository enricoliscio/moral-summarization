SUMMARY:

The moral fabric of our nation is at stake as Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) refuses to back down from his claims of Trump-Russia collusion, despite the Mueller report's findings. The House Intelligence Committee's nine Republican members have called for Schiff's resignation as chairman, citing his "demonstrably false narrative" and "unlawful lying and leaking" of information. Even President Trump has joined the chorus, demanding Schiff's ouster from Congress. Schiff's stubborn insistence on promoting a discredited theory is "alarming" and "incompatible" with his duty as chairman. His actions are "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic," and his refusal to accept the report's conclusions is a stark example of corruption and collusion. The American people deserve better from their leaders. Schiff must be held accountable for his actions and step down from his position.

END OF SUMMARY.
