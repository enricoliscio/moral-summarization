SUMMARY: Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have called for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman due to his public comments about the Russia investigation. Schiff has maintained his belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, despite the investigation concluding no direct evidence of collusion. The Republicans accuse Schiff of promoting false narratives and being linked to leaked information. They state that Mueller's findings refute Schiff's assertions and that his actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman. Schiff has defended his position, stating that he finds the situation immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. The president has also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of unlawfully lying and leaking information.
