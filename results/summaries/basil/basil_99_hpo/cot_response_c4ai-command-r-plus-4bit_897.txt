SUMMARY: 
The House Intelligence Committee's Republican members are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as their chairman, accusing him of spreading misinformation about the Trump-Russia investigation. They claim that Schiff's persistent belief in collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, despite Mueller's report, is "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." Schiff, however, remains steadfast in his stance, questioning the ethics of Trump's circle and asserting his belief in their "corrupt" and "collusive" behavior. The GOP members, backed by Trump, demand Schiff's ouster from Congress, alleging that his actions undermine his duty as chairman to provide effective oversight of the intelligence community. Schiff, undeterred, emphasizes his concerns about the morality and patriotism of those implicated in the investigation, highlighting the indictments of individuals close to Trump. The controversy revolves around differing interpretations of Mueller's report, with Republicans claiming it refutes Schiff's assertions and Democrats seeking its full disclosure.
