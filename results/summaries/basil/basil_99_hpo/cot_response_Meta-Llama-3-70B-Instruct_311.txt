SUMMARY:
House Intelligence Committee Republicans are calling for Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" about the Trump-Russia connection. Schiff, however, remains adamant that there was "undoubtedly" collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. He believes it's "immoral", "unethical", and "unpatriotic" to ignore the investigation's findings, which indicted over 30 people, including those close to Trump. Schiff's critics argue that Mueller's report "conclusively refutes" his assertions, but Schiff counters that the report "does not exonerate" the President. The GOP committee members' letter states that Schiff's actions are "incompatible" with his duty as Chairman, while Trump himself demands Schiff's ouster, accusing him of "unlawfully lying and leaking" information. Schiff refuses to back down, calling for the release of the full report to uncover the truth. END OF SUMMARY.
