Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee demanding Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation. They're upset because Schiff continues to believe there was collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, even though Mueller's report didn't find direct evidence. 

I should start by identifying the key points: the Republicans are accusing Schiff of promoting a false narrative, leaking information, and being unethical. Schiff counters by saying their actions are corrupt and unethical. The author used specific moral terms like collusion, investigate, compromised, leaking, unethical, etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to mention Schiff's belief in collusion, the Republicans' accusations, their letter's contents, Trump's tweet, and Schiff's response. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include as many of the moral terms as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me draft it: 

Nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are urging Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman due to his public statements about the Russia investigation. Schiff maintains that there was collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, despite Mueller's report not finding direct evidence. The Republicans accuse Schiff of promoting a false narrative, leaking information, and acting unethically. They claim his actions are incompatible with his role as chairman. Trump also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of lying and leaking. Schiff counters by stating the Republicans' actions are corrupt and unethical.

Wait, I should include more details about the letter and Mueller's findings. Also, mention that Mueller's report doesn't exonerate Trump. Maybe add that Schiff is continuing to investigate counterintelligence issues.

Revised draft:

Nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are demanding Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman, accusing him of promoting a false narrative about collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Despite Mueller's report not finding direct evidence, Schiff insists on continuing to investigate potential compromises by Trump or his associates. The Republicans argue Schiff's actions are unethical and incompatible with his role, linking him to leaked information. Trump also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of lying and leaking. Schiff counters, labeling the Republicans' actions as corrupt and unethical, emphasizing the need for transparency in the investigation.

That's concise and includes the moral terms. Let me check the word count. It's under 200 words. I think this captures the essence while preserving the moral framing.
