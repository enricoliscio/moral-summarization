SUMMARY: All nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman over his comments on the Russia investigation. Schiff has expressed his strong belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, despite the investigation finding no evidence of conspiracy. The Republicans accuse Schiff of promoting a false narrative and being part of a media campaign to spread misinformation about President Trump. They claim that Mueller's findings refute Schiff's assertions, although the report does not fully exonerate the President. Schiff, however, remains steadfast, questioning the ethics and morality of the situation and asserting his belief in the existence of collusion and corruption. 

END OF SUMMARY.
