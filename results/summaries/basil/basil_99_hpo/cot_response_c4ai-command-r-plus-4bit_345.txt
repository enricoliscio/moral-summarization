SUMMARY:
Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman over his comments on the Russia investigation. Schiff has expressed his strong belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia despite the investigation's conclusion. He has stated that he finds the situation *immoral*, *unethical*, *unpatriotic*, and *corrupt*, indicating *collusion*. The Republicans accuse Schiff of promoting false narratives and being part of a media campaign, with some even linking him to leaked information. They argue that his actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman. Schiff, however, stands firm, questioning the ethics of the situation and emphasizing his concerns about potential counterintelligence issues involving the president. The dispute highlights the ongoing political divide and differing interpretations of Mueller's report.
