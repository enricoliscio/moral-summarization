SUMMARY: Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman due to his persistent belief in collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite the conclusion of the Mueller investigation finding no evidence of conspiracy. They accuse Schiff of promoting false narratives and being part of a media campaign to spread misinformation. However, Schiff stands by his concerns, believing that the actions of the Trump campaign are immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. He continues to question the integrity of those involved with Trump, suggesting they may be compromised by a hostile foreign power. The Republicans' letter concludes that Schiff's actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman, yet Democrats are demanding the release of the full Mueller report to ensure transparency and maintain trust in the intelligence community's oversight.

END OF SUMMARY.
