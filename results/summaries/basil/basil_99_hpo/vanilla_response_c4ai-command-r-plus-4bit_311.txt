SUMMARY: Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have called for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman over his public comments expressing belief in collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia despite the conclusion of the Mueller investigation. They accuse Schiff of promoting a false narrative and engaging in "unlawfully lying and leaking." Trump himself has also called for Schiff's resignation, suggesting he should be forced to step down from Congress. The Republicans' letter states that Mueller's findings refute Schiff's assertions, though the report does not exonerate Trump. Schiff has defended his stance, stating that he believes the actions of the Trump campaign to be immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. 

END OF SUMMARY.
