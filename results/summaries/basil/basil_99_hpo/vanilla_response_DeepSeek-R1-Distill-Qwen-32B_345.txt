Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about the House Intelligence Committee's Republican members asking Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman. They're upset with his comments about the Russia investigation. 

Schiff believes there was collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, even though the Mueller report didn't find direct evidence of that. The Republicans in the committee sent a letter accusing Schiff of promoting a false narrative and being part of a media campaign. They even linked him to leaked information. They think his actions are incompatible with his role as chairman.

Trump also weighed in, calling for Schiff's resignation and accusing him of lying and leaking information. Schiff, on the other hand, maintains his stance, saying it's unethical and unpatriotic to not investigate further. The Mueller report didn't exonerate Trump but also didn't find him guilty of a crime, so Democrats are pushing for the full report's release.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main point: nine Republicans want Schiff to resign. Then explain whyâ€”they disagree with his statements about collusion despite the Mueller findings. Mention the letter's accusations and Trump's tweet. Also, include Schiff's response and the Democrats' stance on releasing the full report.

I should make sure to include key details: Schiff's belief in collusion, Mueller's inconclusive findings, the Republicans' accusations, Trump's call for resignation, Schiff's defense, and the ongoing debate over the report's release.

Let me structure it step by step to cover all these points concisely. Make sure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit. I'll avoid getting too deep into each point but ensure all main elements are covered.
