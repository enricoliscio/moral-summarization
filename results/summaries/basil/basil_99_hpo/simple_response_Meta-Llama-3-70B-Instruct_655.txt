SUMMARY:

The moral fabric of our nation is at stake as Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) is being called out for his unethical and unpatriotic behavior. Despite the Mueller report's findings, Schiff continues to spread false narratives about Trump-Russia collusion, demonstrating a blatant disregard for the truth. The nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are demanding his resignation as chairman, citing his "demonstrably false narrative" and "alarming" willingness to promote it. Even President Trump has joined the chorus, accusing Schiff of "unlawfully lying and leaking" information. Schiff's refusal to accept the report's conclusions and his continued pursuit of a partisan agenda are incompatible with his duty to provide effective oversight of the U.S. intelligence community. His actions are a stark reminder of the importance of integrity and accountability in our political leaders.

END OF SUMMARY.
