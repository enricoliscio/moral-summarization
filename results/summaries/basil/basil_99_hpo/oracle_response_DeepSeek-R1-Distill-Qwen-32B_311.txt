Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee asking Adam Schiff to resign because of his comments on the Russia investigation. Schiff believes there was collusion, but Mueller's report didn't find direct evidence. The Republicans accuse Schiff of promoting a false narrative and leaking information, calling his actions unethical and unpatriotic.

I should start by identifying the key events: Schiff's comments, the Republicans' accusations, and the moral terms used. I'll need to include words like collusion, investigate, compromised, leaking, narrative, lying, unethical, corrupt, etc.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Schiff's stance, then the Republicans' accusations, and finally the implications. I'll ensure each sentence includes the moral framing words where appropriate.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. I'll also make sure to mention Mueller's findings and the Democrats' call for the report's release, as that adds context to the moral debate.

Let me draft the summary, checking each sentence to include the necessary terms without making it sound forced. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it clear and straightforward, sticking to the user's instructions.

After writing, I'll review to ensure all key points are covered and that the moral words are preserved. I'll also make sure the summary flows logically from Schiff's position to the Republicans' accusations and the broader implications.

SUMMARY: Nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have demanded Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) resign as chairman, accusing him of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" about the Russia investigation. Schiff has maintained his belief in collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite the Mueller report not directly implicating President Trump. The GOP members claim Schiff is part of a "well-orchestrated media campaign" and have linked him to leaked information, calling his actions "alarming." They argue his statements are "incompatible" with his duty as chairman, emphasizing the committee's role in providing oversight. Trump also weighed in, accusing Schiff of "unlawfully lying and leaking" and demanding his resignation. Schiff, however, has doubled down, calling the situation "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," and "corrupt," while insisting on the need to investigate whether Trump or his associates were compromised by a foreign power. The Democrats, meanwhile, are calling for the full Mueller report to be released publicly. END OF SUMMARY.
