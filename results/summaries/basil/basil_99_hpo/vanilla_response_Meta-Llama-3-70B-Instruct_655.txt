SUMMARY:

The nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to resign as chairman due to his continued claims of Trump-Russia collusion despite the Mueller report's findings. Schiff maintains that there was "undoubtedly" collusion, and the committee will continue to investigate counterintelligence issues. The Republicans accuse Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" and linking him to leaked information. President Trump also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "unlawfully lying and leaking" information. Schiff responded by doubling down on his questions about the investigation, calling it "immoral," "unethical," and "corrupt." The Democrats are uniformly calling for the Justice Department to release the full Mueller report publicly. The Republicans argue that Schiff's actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman, and he should step down.
