SUMMARY: Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have called for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as chairman over his comments on the Russia investigation. Schiff has expressed his strong belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, despite the investigation finding no direct evidence of conspiracy. The Republicans accused Schiff of promoting false narratives and being part of a media campaign to link Trump to Russia. They also suggested that he was involved in leaking information. In response, Schiff doubled down on his position, stating that Trump's actions were immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. The Republicans' letter concluded that Schiff's actions were incompatible with his duty as chairman of the committee responsible for oversight of the intelligence community. This incident highlights the ethical dilemmas and political tensions surrounding the investigation and raises questions about the appropriate use of power and the responsibility of elected officials to uphold the truth.
