Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. The main points are that nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are asking Rep. Adam Schiff to resign because of his comments on the Russia investigation. Schiff believes there was collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, but the Mueller report didn't directly implicate Trump. The Republicans are accusing Schiff of promoting a false narrative and even linking him to leaks. Trump also tweeted about Schiff lying and leaking, suggesting he should resign. Schiff counters by saying the report doesn't exonerate Trump and that not releasing it is immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all the morally framed single words. Let me go through the article again. Words like "resign," "false," "alarming," "unlawfully lying," "leaking," "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," "corrupt," "collusion." These all carry moral connotations.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words. I should structure it to include the main actors, their actions, and the moral terms used. I'll start by stating the Republicans' demand for Schiff's resignation due to his comments. Then mention the Mueller report's findings and Schiff's belief in collusion. The Republicans accuse him of promoting a false narrative and leaking info. Trump adds his own accusations. Schiff defends his stance, using strong moral terms. Finally, note the Democrats' call for the report's release.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points while preserving the moral language. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each sentence covers a main point and incorporates the moral words appropriately.
