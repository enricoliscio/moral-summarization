Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main issue is that nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling for Adam Schiff to resign as chairman. They're upset because Schiff believes there was collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, even though Mueller's report didn't directly implicate Trump. 

The author uses several morally charged words like "collusion," "investigate," "compromised," and "unpatriotic." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. 

I should start by stating the Republicans' demand for Schiff's resignation. Then, explain Schiff's stance and the Mueller report's findings. Next, mention the accusations from the Republicans about Schiff promoting a false narrative and leaking information. It's important to highlight the moral terms they used against him, like "unlawfully lying" and "unpatriotic." 

Also, I should include Schiff's response, where he accuses the Republicans of being corrupt and unethical. Finally, note that Democrats want the full Mueller report released. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it flows logically, preserving the moral language throughout. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each key point is covered concisely.

SUMMARY: Nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have demanded Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) resign as chairman, accusing him of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" about collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Schiff has maintained his belief in collusion despite the Mueller report not implicating President Trump. The Republicans allege Schiff is part of a media campaign and accuses him of leaking information, calling his actions "alarming" and "unpatriotic." They claim Mueller's findings "conclusively refute" Schiff's assertions, though Mueller neither exonerated nor accused Trump of a crime. Schiff, in response, doubled down on his stance, calling the GOP's actions "immoral," "unethical," and "corrupt." Democrats, meanwhile, continue to push for the full Mueller report's release. END OF SUMMARY.
