SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Republicans are calling for Rep. Adam Schiff's resignation as chairman over his comments on the Russia investigation. Schiff has expressed strong belief in Trump-Russia collusion despite the probe's conclusion. Republicans accuse Schiff of promoting a false narrative and being linked to leaked information. They claim his actions are "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." Schiff, however, questions the probe's scope, believing it to be "compromised," and calls for further investigation, citing counterintelligence concerns. He stands by his position, deeming the matter "corrupt" and indicative of "collusion." The dispute highlights ongoing partisan divides and differing interpretations of Mueller's findings, with Democrats pushing for the report's public release.
END OF SUMMARY.
