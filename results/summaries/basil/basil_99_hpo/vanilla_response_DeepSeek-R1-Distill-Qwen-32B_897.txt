Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee asking Rep. Adam Schiff to resign. They're upset because Schiff believes there was collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, even though the Mueller report didn't find direct evidence. Schiff maintains his stance, saying collusion happened. The Republicans accuse him of promoting a false narrative and even link him to leaks. Trump also tweeted, calling for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of lying and leaking. The Mueller report didn't exonerate Trump but also didn't find a crime. Democrats want the full report released. Schiff defends his position, saying it's immoral and unethical not to question the findings.

So, the key points are: Republicans want Schiff to step down because of his comments on Russia collusion, despite Mueller's findings. They say he's part of a media campaign and promoting false info. Trump supports this. Democrats are pushing for the full Mueller report. Schiff insists collusion happened and the investigation isn't over.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with the Republicans' demand, mention Schiff's beliefs, the Mueller report's conclusions, the accusations against Schiff, Trump's involvement, and the Democrats' stance. I should make sure it's clear and concise, covering all main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: All nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee have demanded Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) resign as chairman, citing his persistent claims of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite the Mueller report finding no direct evidence. Schiff maintains his belief in collusion and continues to investigate counterintelligence issues, asserting that Mueller’s report did not address whether the president or his associates were compromised by a foreign power. The GOP members accused Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" and linked him to leaked information, arguing his actions conflict with his duties as chairman. President Trump also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "unlawfully lying and leaking." Mueller’s report concluded Trump did not commit a crime but did not exonerate him. Democrats are urging the release of the full Mueller report. Schiff defended his stance, calling it immoral and unethical to ignore the findings, which indicted over 30 individuals tied to Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
