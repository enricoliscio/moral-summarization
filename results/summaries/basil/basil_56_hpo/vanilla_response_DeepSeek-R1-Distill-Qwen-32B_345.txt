Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. Let me read through the article first to get the main points. 

Rubio is a U.S. Senator from Florida and a GOP presidential candidate. He spoke at the Council on Foreign Relations, invoking JFK's policies. He's pushing for a stronger military budget and more assertive U.S. presence globally. He believes American strength prevents war, unlike Obama's approach, which he thinks is too passive. 

He's laying out his "Rubio Doctrine" based on three principles: American strength, protecting the economy, and moral clarity on values. He's been opposing Obama's policies, like the Cuba rapprochement, Iran negotiations, Syria rebels support, and aid to Ukraine. He criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as ineffective. 

When asked about JFK, he said the principles are timeless. He also mentioned he wouldn't have supported the Iraq invasion if he knew there were no WMDs, unlike Jeb Bush who did support it.

So, the summary needs to capture Rubio's vision, his principles, his criticism of Obama and Clinton, and his stance on Iraq. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to include key points without getting too detailed. Also, structure it logically, starting with his speech, then his principles, criticisms, and the Iraq comment. 

I think that's all. Let me put it together in a clear, concise manner.
