Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, Rubio spoke at the Council on Foreign Relations, pushing for a stronger U.S. military and more assertive foreign policy. He compared himself to JFK, emphasizing that American strength prevents war. He criticized Obama for being too passive and not leading enough, which he thinks makes the world less safe.

He outlined three principles: American strength, protecting the economy, and moral clarity. He's been opposing Obama on several fronts, like normalizing Cuba relations, Iran talks, Syria rebels, and Ukraine aid.

He also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, calling it ineffective. When asked about JFK and appearing outdated, Rubio said the principles are timeless. He also commented on the Iraq invasion, saying he wouldn't have supported it if he knew there were no WMDs, unlike Jeb Bush who did.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention Rubio's main points, his criticism of Obama and Clinton, his principles, and the Iraq comment. Keep it concise but cover all key aspects without getting too detailed.
