SUMMARY:

Senator Marco Rubio presented a foreign policy vision that emphasizes American strength and moral clarity. He invoked President John F. Kennedy's assertive approach to project American power abroad, arguing that a stronger U.S. military and more aggressive global engagement would lead to a safer world. Rubio criticized President Obama's approach, saying that weakness invites danger and that America's global influence is a benevolent force. He outlined the "Rubio Doctrine," guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy, and moral clarity regarding America's core values. Rubio also took aim at Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, calling her tenure as secretary of state "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." He distanced himself from the 2003 invasion of Iraq, saying he would not have authorized it if he knew Saddam Hussein didn't have weapons of mass destruction. Rubio's vision emphasizes American leadership and strength as essential to maintaining peace and preventing war.

END OF SUMMARY.
