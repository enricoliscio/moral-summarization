Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, Rubio is talking about increasing the military budget and being more assertive globally. He compares himself to JFK, saying that American strength prevents war, not promotes it. He criticizes Obama for believing the U.S. was too engaged and that stepping back would make the world better. He mentions his three principles: American strength, protecting the economy, and moral clarity on values. He's opposed Obama's policies on Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine. He also criticizes Hillary Clinton's tenure as ineffective. Rubio claims he wouldn't have supported the Iraq invasion if he knew there were no WMDs, unlike Jeb Bush.

Now, I need to include as many of the morally framed words as possible: threats, understood, preventing, promoting, weakness, danger, enemy, disagrees, believing, building, ceding, protection, clarity, help, negligent, trapped, destruction, favor.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Rubio's vision, his criticism of Obama, his principles, and his stance on various policies. I'll make sure to use the moral words where appropriate without making it sound forced.

Let me draft it:

"Sen. Marco Rubio presented a foreign policy vision emphasizing American strength to prevent global threats, contrasting with President Obama's approach. He argued that weakness invites danger and criticized Obama for believing the U.S. was over-engaged, advocating instead for a more assertive role. Rubio's principles include protecting the economy and promoting moral clarity. He opposes Obama's policies on Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine, and labels Hillary Clinton's tenure as ineffective. Rubio also stated he would not have favored the Iraq invasion if no WMDs were present, differing from Jeb Bush's stance."

That should cover the main points and include the moral terms effectively.
