SUMMARY: Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) presented his foreign policy vision, dubbed the "Rubio Doctrine," in a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations. Rubio's doctrine is based on three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy in a globalized world, and moral clarity regarding America's core values. He criticized President Obama's foreign policy, arguing that the world would be safer with a larger U.S. military presence and more aggressive American leadership. Rubio also took aim at Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, calling it negligent. In a subsequent interview, Rubio distanced himself from Jeb Bush's comments on the Iraq War, stating that he would not have authorized the invasion knowing that Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction. Rubio's foreign policy stance emphasizes a more interventionist and assertive approach to global affairs.
END OF SUMMARY.
