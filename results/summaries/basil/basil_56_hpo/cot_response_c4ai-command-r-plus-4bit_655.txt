SUMMARY: U.S. Senator Marco Rubio shared his foreign policy vision, invoking President John F. Kennedy's principles of American strength and its role in preventing war. Rubio criticized President Obama for his perceived belief that America is too hard on its adversaries and too engaged globally. Rubio's doctrine emphasizes American strength, protection of economic interests, and moral clarity on core values. He has taken positions opposing normalization with Cuba, negotiations with Iran, and the Iraq War, while advocating for more support of Syrian rebels and aid to Ukraine. Rubio's vision, guided by principles of strength, leadership, and moral clarity, contrasts with Obama's approach and aims to project American power and influence abroad. Rubio believes that by asserting American strength and leadership, the world will be safer and peace can be maintained, all while avoiding the dangers of weakness and negligence.
