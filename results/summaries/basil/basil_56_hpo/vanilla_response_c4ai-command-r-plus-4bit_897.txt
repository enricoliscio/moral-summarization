SUMMARY: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio presented his foreign policy vision, dubbed the "Rubio Doctrine," during a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations. Rubio's doctrine is based on three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy in a globalized world, and moral clarity regarding America's core values. He criticized President Obama for his approach to foreign policy, arguing that the U.S. should project its power more aggressively and increase military spending. Rubio also took a swipe at Hillary Clinton, calling her tenure as secretary of state "ineffective." In the speech, Rubio invoked President John F. Kennedy's belief in American strength as a means of preventing war. He later clarified that his reference to Kennedy was not outdated but rather represented timeless truths. Additionally, Rubio stated that he would not have authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq, differing from fellow GOP contender Jeb Bush. Rubio has been an active voice in foreign policy debates, opposing the Obama administration's efforts to normalize relations with Cuba and negotiate with Iran.
END OF SUMMARY.
