SUMMARY:

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio presented a foreign policy vision, invoking President John F. Kennedy, emphasizing the need for American strength to prevent war and promote peace. Rubio believes that America's global influence is a benevolent force, and that weakness is a friend of danger and the enemy of peace. He disagrees with President Obama, who Rubio thinks believes that America was too hard on its adversaries and should take a step back, ceding leadership to other countries. Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy, and moral clarity regarding America's core values. Rubio has consistently challenged Obama's foreign policy efforts, opposing normalization with Cuba, Iran nuclear negotiations, and advocating for more support to Ukraine. He also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state as "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." Rubio emphasized that American strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it, and that weakness is a threat to peace.

END OF SUMMARY.
