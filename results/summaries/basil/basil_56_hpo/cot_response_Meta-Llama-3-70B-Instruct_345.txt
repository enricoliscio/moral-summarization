SUMMARY:
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio presented a foreign policy vision that emphasizes the importance of American strength and moral clarity in maintaining global peace and security. He invoked President John F. Kennedy's legacy, arguing that American power is a benevolent force that prevents war and promotes peace. Rubio criticized President Obama's approach, saying that weakness is a friend of danger and an enemy of peace. He outlined the "Rubio Doctrine," guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy, and moral clarity regarding America's core values. Rubio also took a swipe at Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, calling her tenure as secretary of state "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." He emphasized that his vision is based on timeless truths, not backward-looking policies. END OF SUMMARY.
