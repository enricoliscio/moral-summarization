SUMMARY:

Senator Marco Rubio delivered a foreign policy speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, outlining his vision for a more assertive American presence globally. He invoked President John F. Kennedy, arguing that American strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it. Rubio criticized President Obama's approach, saying that weakness is the friend of danger and the enemy of peace. He outlined his "Rubio Doctrine," guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy, and moral clarity regarding America's core values. Rubio also took a swipe at Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, calling it "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." He distanced himself from the 2003 invasion of Iraq, saying he would not have authorized it if he knew Saddam Hussein didn't have weapons of mass destruction. Rubio's speech emphasized the importance of American leadership and strength in maintaining global peace and security.
