Rubio believes that a powerful U.S. military and assertive global leadership are necessary to maintain world peace and safety. He criticized President Obama for his perceived belief that America is too engaged globally and that a step back would benefit the nation. Rubio's doctrine is guided by principles of American strength, protection of economic interests, and moral clarity. Rubio has taken positions contrary to the Obama administration on issues like Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine. He accused Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State of being "ineffective" and "negligent."
