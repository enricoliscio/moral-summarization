SUMMARY: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio presented a foreign policy vision invoking President John F. Kennedy's assertion of American power abroad. Rubio's comments, delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, emphasized the need for a stronger U.S. military presence and a more aggressive assertion of American influence globally. He believes that American strength prevents war and weakness fosters danger. Rubio criticized President Obama for his perceived belief that America is too engaged in global affairs and that a step back would benefit the country. Rubio's doctrine is guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy in a globalized world, and moral clarity regarding America's core values. He has taken positions counter to the Obama administration on issues like Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine. Rubio also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. In a subsequent interview, Rubio emphasized the "timelessness" of Kennedy's beliefs and clarified that he would not have supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. END OF SUMMARY.
