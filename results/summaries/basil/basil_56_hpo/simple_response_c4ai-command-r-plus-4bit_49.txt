SUMMARY: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) presented a foreign policy vision that calls for a stronger U.S. military presence and a more aggressive assertion of American power globally. Rubio's comments, delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, were guided by three principles: "American strength," "protection of the American economy," and "moral clarity regarding America's core values." Rubio criticized President Obama for his perceived belief that America is too hard on its adversaries and too engaged globally, arguing that American strength prevents war while weakness is the friend of danger. Rubio's stance on foreign policy directly counters the Obama administration's efforts, including normalizing relations with Cuba and negotiating with Iran. Rubio also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state and stated that he would not have authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Rubio's foreign policy vision, dubbed the "Rubio Doctrine," emphasizes the projection of American power and influence as a force for good in the world. END OF SUMMARY.
