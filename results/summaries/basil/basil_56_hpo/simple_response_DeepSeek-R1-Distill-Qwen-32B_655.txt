Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to get the main points.

Rubio is a Republican senator and a GOP presidential candidate. He's presenting his foreign policy vision, calling it the "Rubio Doctrine." He's comparing himself to JFK, emphasizing American strength as a way to prevent war, not promote it. He's criticizing Obama's approach, saying Obama thinks the US is too engaged and that stepping back would make the world better. Rubio's principles are American strength, protecting the economy, and moral clarity on values.

He's opposed to Obama's policies towards Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine. He criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. He also mentioned not supporting the Iraq invasion if he knew there were no WMDs, contrasting with Jeb Bush's support.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects, like Rubio's emphasis on strength preventing war and his criticism of Obama's policies as weak. Also, highlighting his opposition to specific Obama initiatives and his stance on Iraq.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll condense each point without losing the essence. Make sure to include Rubio's principles, his criticism of Obama and Clinton, and the contrast with Jeb Bush on Iraq.

Let me structure it: start with Rubio's speech and doctrine, mention JFK comparison, his principles, opposition to Obama's policies, criticism of Clinton, and the Iraq stance. Make sure it's concise and flows well.
