SUMMARY:
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio outlined his foreign policy vision, invoking President John F. Kennedy's assertive approach to project American power abroad. Rubio believes that American strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it, and that weakness is the friend of danger and the enemy of peace. He criticized President Obama's approach, saying it is sadly misguided and lacks moral clarity. Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy, and moral clarity regarding America's core values. He also took a swipe at Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, calling her tenure as secretary of state "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." Rubio's vision is rooted in timeless truths, and he believes that America's global influence remains a benevolent force. END OF SUMMARY.
