SUMMARY:

Senator Marco Rubio presented a foreign policy vision that emphasizes American strength and assertiveness abroad, invoking President John F. Kennedy's ideals. Rubio believes that a stronger US military and more aggressive global engagement would lead to a safer world. He criticized President Obama's approach, saying that weakness invites danger and undermines peace. Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: American strength, economic protection, and moral clarity. He has consistently opposed Obama's policies, including normalizing relations with Cuba and negotiating with Iran. Rubio also took a swipe at Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, calling it "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." When questioned about invoking Kennedy and the Cold War, Rubio argued that these principles are timeless truths. Rubio also stated that he would not have authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq if he knew Saddam Hussein didn't have weapons of mass destruction.

END OF SUMMARY.
