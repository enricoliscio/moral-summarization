Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

Rubio is a U.S. Senator from Florida and a Republican candidate for president. He spoke at the Council on Foreign Relations, talking about his foreign policy vision. He compared himself to President Kennedy, emphasizing American strength and military budget increases. He believes that a stronger military and more assertive U.S. presence would make the world safer. He criticized Obama's approach, saying Obama thought the U.S. was too engaged and should step back, which Rubio disagrees with.

He outlined three principles: American strength, protecting the economy, and moral clarity. He's been opposing Obama's policies, like the Cuba rapprochement, Iran nuclear talks, Syria rebels support, and aid to Ukraine. He also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, calling it ineffective or negligent. When asked about appearing backward-looking by invoking Kennedy, he said the principles were timeless. He also commented on the Iraq invasion, saying he wouldn't have supported it if he knew there were no WMDs, unlike Jeb Bush who did.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Rubio's main points: his foreign policy vision, comparison to Kennedy, criticism of Obama, three principles, opposition to Obama's policies, criticism of Clinton, and stance on Iraq. Make sure it's concise and captures all key elements without being too detailed.
