SUMMARY: In a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, Republican Senator Marco Rubio presented his vision for US foreign policy, dubbed the "Rubio Doctrine." Rubio's doctrine emphasizes American strength, protection of the US economy in a globalized world, and moral clarity on American values. Rubio criticized President Obama for his approach to foreign policy, claiming that Obama believes the US is "too engaged in too many places." Rubio also opposed the normalization of relations with Cuba and the negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. He took a swipe at Hillary Clinton, calling her tenure as Secretary of State "ineffective." Rubio's speech invoked President John F. Kennedy and his belief in American strength as a means of preventing war. Rubio stated that he would not have authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq, unlike his rival Jeb Bush who has stated he would have. Rubio's foreign policy positions highlight his assertiveness and willingness to project American power abroad.
