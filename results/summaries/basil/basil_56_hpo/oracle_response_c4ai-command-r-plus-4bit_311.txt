SUMMARY: Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), in a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, presented a foreign policy vision invoking President John F. Kennedy and emphasizing American strength and global influence as a force for peace. Rubio's comments, known as the "Rubio Doctrine," were guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy in a globalized world, and moral clarity regarding America's core values. He believes that a stronger U.S. military and a more aggressive assertion of power are key to making the world safer. Rubio disagrees with President Obama's approach, believing that the president sees America as a promoter of war rather than a force for peace. The senator also criticized the Obama administration's policies toward Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine, and accused Democratic rival Hillary Clinton of negligence during her tenure as secretary of state. In response to a question about the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Rubio stated that he would not have authorized it, unlike his rival Jeb Bush, who has since retracted his initial support. Rubio's speech portrayed a forward-thinking vision while drawing on timeless truths espoused by Kennedy. END OF SUMMARY.
