SUMMARY: U.S. Senator Marco Rubio presented his foreign policy vision, the "Rubio Doctrine," guided by the principles of "American strength," protection of economic interests, and "moral clarity." Rubio advocated for a stronger U.S. military presence and more assertive global leadership, contrasting himself with President Obama, whom he accused of projecting weakness and misunderstanding the benevolent nature of American power. Rubio criticized Obama's approach to Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine, suggesting that these policies lacked moral clarity and endangered peace by emboldening adversaries. He also took aim at Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, labeling it as ineffective and dangerously negligent. In response to a question about the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Rubio stated he would not have supported it had he known Saddam Hussein did not possess weapons of mass destruction, demonstrating a commitment to moral clarity and avoiding dangerous negligence. Rubio's speech and subsequent comments emphasized the timelessness of strong American leadership and the need to project strength and protect American values on the global stage. END OF SUMMARY.
