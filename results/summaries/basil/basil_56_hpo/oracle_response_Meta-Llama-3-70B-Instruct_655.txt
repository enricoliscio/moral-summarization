SUMMARY:

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio outlined his foreign policy vision, emphasizing the need for a stronger U.S. military presence globally to prevent war and promote peace. He invoked President John F. Kennedy's philosophy, stating that American strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it, and that weakness is a friend of danger and an enemy of peace. Rubio criticized President Obama's approach, saying he often disagrees with this "simple truth" and instead believes that America should take a step back and cede leadership to other countries. Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy, and moral clarity regarding America's core values. He also took a swipe at Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, calling her tenure as secretary of state "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." Rubio emphasized that his approach is not backward-looking, but rather based on timeless truths.
