SUMMARY: Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican presidential hopeful, laid out his foreign policy vision, invoking President John F. Kennedy's belief in American strength as a force for peace. Rubio criticized President Obama for retreating on the world stage and argued that a robust U.S. military presence and assertive global leadership are necessary to prevent war and protect American interests. Guided by principles of strength, economic protectionism, and moral clarity, Rubio outlined a hawkish "Rubio Doctrine," including opposition to Obama's policies on Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine. He also criticized Hillary Clinton's record as secretary of state. In a Q&A, Rubio distanced himself from Jeb Bush's comments supporting the Iraq War, stating he would not have authorized the invasion knowing the absence of WMDs. Rubio's speech emphasized a proactive and muscular U.S. foreign policy, reflecting his belief in America's benevolent global influence.
