SUMMARY:

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio outlined his foreign policy vision, invoking President John F. Kennedy's ideals of projecting American power abroad. Rubio emphasized that American strength is key to preventing war and promoting peace, whereas weakness invites danger. He criticized President Obama's approach, accusing him of believing that America is too aggressive and needs to cede leadership to other countries. Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: American strength, protecting the economy, and moral clarity on core values. He has consistently opposed Obama's policies, including normalizing relations with Cuba and negotiating with Iran. Rubio also took a swipe at Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, calling it "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." When questioned about invoking Kennedy, Rubio defended his stance, saying that the principles are timeless truths. Rubio also stated that he would not have authorized the 2003 Iraq invasion if he knew Saddam Hussein didn't have WMDs.
