Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. Let me read through it carefully. 

The article starts by mentioning that Rubio, a Republican Senator from Florida, presented his foreign policy vision at the Council on Foreign Relations. He compared himself to President Kennedy, emphasizing the importance of American strength to prevent war. He criticized Obama for being too passive and not engaging enough, which he believes makes the world less safe.

Rubio outlined three main principles: American strength, protecting the economy, and moral clarity. He's been opposing Obama's policies, like the Cuba and Iran negotiations, supporting rebels in Syria, and aiding Ukraine against Russia. He also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, calling it ineffective.

He addressed the Iraq invasion, saying he wouldn't have supported it if he knew there were no WMDs, which contrasts with Jeb Bush's support. The summary needs to capture all these points concisely, under 200 words, and include key elements like Rubio's principles, his criticism of Obama and Clinton, and his stance on Iraq.

I should structure the summary to first mention Rubio's speech, his invocation of Kennedy, the three principles, his opposition to Obama's policies, his criticism of Clinton, and his stance on Iraq. Make sure it's clear and within the word limit.
