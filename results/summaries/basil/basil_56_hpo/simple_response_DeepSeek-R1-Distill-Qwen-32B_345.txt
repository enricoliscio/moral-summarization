Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

Rubio is talking about his vision for foreign policy, comparing it to JFK's approach. He's advocating for a stronger military budget and more assertive U.S. involvement globally. He believes this strength prevents war, unlike weakness which he says leads to danger. He's critical of Obama's approach, saying Obama thought the U.S. was too involved and that stepping back would help. Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" has three principles: American strength, protecting the economy, and moral clarity on values.

He's been opposing Obama's policies, like the Cuba normalization, Iran negotiations, Syria rebels, and Ukraine aid. He also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. When asked about JFK and appearing outdated, Rubio says the principles are timeless. He also mentions he wouldn't have supported the Iraq invasion if he knew there were no WMDs, differing from Jeb Bush's stance.

I need to make sure the summary captures Rubio's main arguments, his criticisms of Obama and Clinton, and his stance on specific policies. Also, highlighting the moral framing, like strength preventing war and weakness being dangerous. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

Let me start drafting the summary, ensuring all key points are included without going over the word limit. I'll make sure to mention his principles, his opposition to Obama's policies, the criticism of Clinton, and his stance on Iraq. I'll also include the timeless aspect of JFK's principles as he mentioned. 

I think that's all the main points. Now, I'll put it together in a clear, concise manner, preserving the moral aspects as the author presented them.

SUMMARY: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) outlined his foreign policy vision, drawing parallels to President John F. Kennedy, emphasizing the importance of American strength to prevent war and deter global threats. Rubio criticized President Obama's approach, arguing that Obama's belief in reducing U.S. engagement and focusing on "nation-building at home" weakened America's influence. Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: American strength, protecting the economy in a globalized world, and moral clarity on core values. He opposes Obama's policies, including normalization with Cuba, nuclear negotiations with Iran, and support for Ukraine against Russian influence. Rubio also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, calling it "ineffective" and "negligent." When questioned about appearing outdated by invoking Kennedy, Rubio defended the principles as "timeless." He distanced himself from the Iraq invasion, stating he would not have supported it if he knew Saddam Hussein lacked weapons of mass destruction, contrasting with Jeb Bush's support. END OF SUMMARY.
