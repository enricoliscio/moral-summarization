Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what the article is about. It's about Senator Marco Rubio outlining his foreign policy vision, comparing it to JFK's, and criticizing Obama and Clinton.

The user wants a summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. The list includes words like threats, understood, preventing, weakness, danger, enemy, disagrees, building, ceding, protection, clarity, help, negligent, trapped, destruction, favor.

I need to make sure these words are included without making the summary too long. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by identifying the key points: Rubio's call for a stronger military, his criticism of Obama's approach, the three principles, and his stance on specific issues like Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine.

I should also mention his criticism of Hillary Clinton and the Iraq invasion. I'll need to weave in the moral terms naturally. For example, "weakness is the friend of danger" and "Obama's policies ceding leadership."

I have to ensure the summary flows well and covers all the main points without omitting any crucial information. I'll check each sentence to see if it includes the moral framing words and adjust as needed to keep it concise.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." and stays within the word limit. I'll read through it to ensure it captures Rubio's stance and the moral elements effectively.

SUMMARY: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) presented a foreign policy vision emphasizing American strength and global influence, drawing parallels to President John F. Kennedy. He argued that American power prevents war and that weakness fosters danger, criticizing President Obama for believing the U.S. should reduce its global involvement. Rubio’s "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: American strength, protecting the economy, and moral clarity on core values. He opposes Obama’s policies, including normalization with Cuba, nuclear talks with Iran, and support for Ukraine against Russia. Rubio also criticized Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, calling it "ineffective" and "negligent." He rejected the 2003 Iraq invasion, stating he would not have favored it if Saddam Hussein lacked weapons of mass destruction. Rubio defended his vision as timeless, countering claims it is outdated. END OF SUMMARY.
