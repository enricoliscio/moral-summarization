Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by saying Rubio presented a foreign policy vision at the Council on Foreign Relations. He invoked JFK, emphasizing American strength as a way to prevent war, not promote it. He contrasts this with Obama's approach, which he believes was too passive.

Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" has three principles: American strength, protecting the economy, and moral clarity. He's been opposing Obama on several fronts, like Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine. He criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as ineffective.

He also addressed Iraq, saying he wouldn't have supported the invasion if he knew there were no WMDs. His stance differs from Jeb Bush, who supported the invasion despite the lack of WMDs.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll highlight Rubio's main points: JFK reference, contrast with Obama, three principles, opposition to Obama's policies, criticism of Clinton, and his stance on Iraq compared to Jeb Bush.

Make sure to include key details without getting too wordy. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each main point is covered concisely.
