Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Hmm, okay. First, I'll read through the article to get the main points.

Rubio is a GOP presidential candidate, and he's laying out his foreign policy vision, calling it the "Rubio Doctrine." He's comparing himself to JFK, emphasizing American strength as a means to prevent war. He's criticizing Obama for not understanding this, saying Obama thought the U.S. was too engaged and needed to step back. Rubio's principles are American strength, protecting the economy, and moral clarity.

He's against Obama's policies like normalizing relations with Cuba and the Iran nuclear deal. He's also critical of Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. He mentions that he wouldn't have supported the Iraq invasion if he knew there were no WMDs, which is a contrast to Jeb Bush's stance.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points: Rubio's vision, his principles, his criticisms of Obama and Clinton, and his stance on Iraq. Also, the moral framing is important, so I should highlight how Rubio presents strength as a positive force for peace and how he contrasts that with Obama's approach.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. Let me structure it: start with Rubio's speech and his vision, then his principles, followed by his criticisms, and end with the Iraq comment. I need to use the right keywords and keep the tone consistent with the original article's framing.

Wait, the user also mentioned being a moral expert. So, in the summary, I should ensure that the moral aspects are clear, like how Rubio positions American strength as a benevolent force and contrasts it with Obama's policies as weakness leading to danger.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and captures all the key points with the correct moral framing.

SUMMARY: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) presented his foreign policy vision, drawing parallels to President John F. Kennedy, emphasizing American strength as a means to prevent war and promote peace. Rubio criticized President Obama for believing that reducing U.S. engagement abroad would improve global relations, arguing that such weakness fosters danger. His "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: American strength, protecting the economy in a globalized world, and moral clarity in upholding core values. Rubio opposes Obama's policies, including normalization with Cuba, nuclear negotiations with Iran, and support for Syrian rebels and Ukraine. He also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state as "ineffective" and "negligent." Rubio distanced himself from the Iraq invasion, stating he would not have supported it if Saddam Hussein lacked weapons of mass destruction, contrasting with Jeb Bush's stance. Rubio framed his vision as timeless, countering claims of being backward-looking. END OF SUMMARY.
