SUMMARY: U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida vying for the GOP presidential nomination, laid out his foreign policy vision, invoking President John F. Kennedy's assertion that American strength prevents war. Rubio believes in the benevolent nature of American global influence and advocates for a stronger U.S. military presence to assertively project power abroad. He criticizes President Barack Obama for his perceived weakness and retreat from global leadership, arguing that it endangers peace and emboldens adversaries. Rubio's doctrine emphasizes American strength, protection of economic interests, and moral clarity. The senator has taken strong stances on Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine, often directly countering the Obama administration's policies. He accuses former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of negligence in her duties. Rubio defends his invocation of Kennedy, stating that the principles of strength and leadership are timeless. Rubio also distances himself from the Iraq invasion decision, stating that he and President Bush would not have supported it knowing the absence of weapons of mass destruction. END OF SUMMARY.
