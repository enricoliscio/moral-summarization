SUMMARY:
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio presented a foreign policy vision, invoking President John F. Kennedy, that emphasizes the need for American strength and assertiveness globally. Rubio believes that a stronger U.S. military and more aggressive American influence would lead to a safer world, as "American strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it." He criticized President Obama's approach, saying it is based on a "simple truth" that "weakness is the friend of danger and the enemy of peace." Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: "American strength," protecting the economy, and "moral clarity" regarding America's core values. He also took a swipe at Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, calling it "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." Rubio's vision is rooted in "timeless" truths, emphasizing the importance of moral leadership in global affairs. END OF SUMMARY.
