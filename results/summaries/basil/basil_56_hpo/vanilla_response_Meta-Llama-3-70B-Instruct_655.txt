SUMMARY:

US Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) outlined his foreign policy vision, invoking President John F. Kennedy's approach to project American power abroad. Rubio called for a bigger US military budget and a more assertive global presence, arguing that American strength prevents war and weakness invites danger. He criticized President Obama's approach, saying it cedes leadership to other countries and prioritizes "nation building at home" over global engagement. Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: American strength, protecting the US economy, and moral clarity on core values. He also took a swipe at Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton, calling her tenure as secretary of state "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." Rubio stated that he would not have authorized the 2003 Iraq invasion if he knew Saddam Hussein didn't have WMDs, differing from Jeb Bush's stance.

END OF SUMMARY.
