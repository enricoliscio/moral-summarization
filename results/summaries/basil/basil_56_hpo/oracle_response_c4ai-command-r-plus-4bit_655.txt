SUMMARY: Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) presented a foreign policy vision invoking President John F. Kennedy and emphasizing American strength and global influence as a force for peace. Rubio's comments contrast with President Obama's approach, which Rubio characterizes as a misunderstanding of America's role in the world. Rubio believes that American strength prevents war, while weakness is the friend of danger. He criticized Obama for believing that America was too hard on its adversaries and too engaged globally, and for ceding leadership to other countries. Rubio outlined the "Rubio Doctrine," guided by principles of American strength, protection of the economy in a globalized world, and moral clarity on core values. Rubio has taken positions opposing Obama's policies on Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine. He also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. Rubio's invocation of Kennedy and his stance on the Iraq invasion highlight his belief in a strong, engaged America, which he sees as essential for global peace and safety. END OF SUMMARY.
