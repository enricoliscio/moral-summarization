SUMMARY:

US Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) outlined his foreign policy vision, invoking President John F. Kennedy's assertive approach to project American power globally. Rubio believes a stronger US military and more aggressive global presence would make the world safer. He criticized President Obama's approach, saying it promotes weakness and danger. Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: American strength, protecting the US economy, and moral clarity on core values. He has opposed Obama's efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, negotiate with Iran, and has advocated for more support to Ukraine and rebels in Syria. Rubio also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, calling it "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." When asked about invoking Kennedy, Rubio said the statements represented "timeless" truths. He also stated he would not have authorized the 2003 Iraq invasion if he knew Saddam Hussein didn't have WMDs.

END OF SUMMARY.
