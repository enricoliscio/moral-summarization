SUMMARY:

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) outlined his foreign policy vision, calling for a stronger U.S. military presence globally and asserting American power to prevent war and promote peace. Rubio invoked President John F. Kennedy, saying that American strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it. He criticized President Obama's approach, saying it has led to a perception of American weakness. Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy, and moral clarity on core values. He also took a swipe at Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, calling her tenure as secretary of state "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." Rubio said he would not have authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq if he knew Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction.

END OF SUMMARY.
