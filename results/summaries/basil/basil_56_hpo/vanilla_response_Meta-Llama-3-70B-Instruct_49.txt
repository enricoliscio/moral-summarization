SUMMARY:

US Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) outlined his foreign policy vision, invoking President John F. Kennedy's assertive approach to project American power globally. Rubio believes a stronger US military and more aggressive global presence would make the world safer. He criticized President Obama's approach, saying it promotes weakness and danger. Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: American strength, protecting the US economy, and moral clarity on core values. He has opposed Obama's policies on Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine. Rubio also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state as "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." When asked about invoking Kennedy and the Cold War, Rubio said the principles are "timeless" truths. He also stated that he would not have authorized the 2003 Iraq invasion if he knew Saddam Hussein didn't have WMDs.

END OF SUMMARY.
