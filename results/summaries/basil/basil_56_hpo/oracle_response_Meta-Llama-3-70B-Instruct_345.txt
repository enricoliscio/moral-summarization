SUMMARY: 

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio presented a foreign policy vision that emphasizes American strength and assertiveness abroad, citing President John F. Kennedy's approach as a model. Rubio believes that American power is a benevolent force that prevents war and promotes peace, whereas weakness is a friend of danger and an enemy of peace. He criticized President Obama's approach, suggesting that it is based on a misguided belief that America is too hard on its adversaries and should cede leadership to other countries. Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy, and moral clarity regarding America's core values. He also took a swipe at Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, calling her tenure as secretary of state "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." Rubio's approach is rooted in a sense of moral clarity, emphasizing the importance of taking a strong stance against threats and promoting American values.
