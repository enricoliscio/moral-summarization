SUMMARY: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio laid out a foreign policy vision invoking President John F. Kennedy and emphasizing American strength and global engagement. He argued that a robust U.S. military presence and assertive leadership are crucial for maintaining world peace and countering threats in the 21st century. Rubio criticized President Obama for his approach, accusing him of believing that American strength promotes war rather than prevents it. Rubio's doctrine is guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy, and moral clarity on core values. He has taken positions contrary to the Obama administration on issues such as Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine. Rubio also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. In a subsequent interview, Rubio stated that he would not have supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq if he knew Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction. Rubio's foreign policy vision emphasizes a strong and morally principled America, contrasting it with what he perceives as Obama's weak and misguided approach. END OF SUMMARY.
