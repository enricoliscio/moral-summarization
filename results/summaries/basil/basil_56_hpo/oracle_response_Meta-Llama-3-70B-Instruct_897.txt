SUMMARY:

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio outlined a foreign policy vision that emphasizes American strength and assertiveness, invoking President John F. Kennedy's legacy. Rubio believes that a stronger U.S. military budget and more aggressive global engagement would prevent war and promote peace. He criticized President Obama's approach, saying that weakness is a "friend of danger" and an "enemy of peace." Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy, and moral clarity regarding America's core values. He has consistently challenged Obama's policies, including normalizing relations with Cuba and negotiating with Iran. Rubio also took a swipe at Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, calling it "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." He emphasized that American strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it, and that weakness is a threat to global peace.
