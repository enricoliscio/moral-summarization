SUMMARY:
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio outlined his foreign policy vision, invoking President John F. Kennedy's assertive approach to project American power abroad. Rubio believes that American strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it, and that weakness is the friend of danger and the enemy of peace. He criticized President Obama's approach, saying that he often disagrees with this "simple truth." Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: American strength, protecting the American economy, and moral clarity regarding America's core values. He took a swipe at Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, calling her tenure as secretary of state "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." Rubio also stated that he would not have authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq if he knew Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction. END OF SUMMARY.
