SUMMARY:
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio presented a foreign policy vision that emphasizes American strength and moral clarity. He invoked President John F. Kennedy, stating that American power is a benevolent force that prevents war and promotes peace. Rubio criticized President Obama's approach, saying that weakness is a friend of danger and an enemy of peace. He outlined the "Rubio Doctrine," guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy, and moral clarity regarding America's core values. Rubio also took a swipe at Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, calling it "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." He emphasized that American strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it, and that weakness is a threat to peace. Rubio's vision is a call to assert American power abroad, with a focus on moral clarity and preventing war. END OF SUMMARY.
