Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the article is about Rubio setting forth his foreign policy vision, comparing it to JFK. He's emphasizing American strength and a bigger military budget. He's critical of Obama's approach, saying it's weak and leads to danger. He mentions three principles: American strength, protecting the economy, and moral clarity. He's also opposing Obama's policies on Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine.

He criticizes Hillary Clinton's tenure as ineffective. Also, he distances himself from the Iraq invasion, saying he wouldn't have supported it if WMDs weren't there, unlike Jeb Bush who did.

I need to capture all these points concisely, keeping the moral tone. The summary should highlight Rubio's stance on strength, his criticism of Obama, the principles, opposition to specific policies, and the Iraq comment.

I should structure it to first mention his speech invoking JFK, then his main points, followed by his criticisms of Obama and Clinton, and end with the Iraq comment. Make sure it's under 200 words and flows well.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is included without getting too wordy. Also, maintain the moral framing by emphasizing strength as a means to prevent war and his opposition to weakness.
