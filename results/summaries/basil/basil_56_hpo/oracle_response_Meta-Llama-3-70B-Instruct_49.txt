SUMMARY:

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio outlined his foreign policy vision, invoking President John F. Kennedy's assertive approach to project American power abroad. Rubio believes a stronger U.S. military budget and more aggressive global influence would prevent war and promote peace. He criticized President Obama's approach, saying it is based on a misguided belief that America is too hard on its adversaries and should cede leadership to other countries. Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: "American strength," protecting the economy, and "moral clarity" regarding America's core values. He has opposed Obama's efforts to normalize relations with Cuba and negotiate with Iran, and has advocated for more support to rebels in Syria and Ukraine. Rubio also took a swipe at Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, calling it "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." He emphasized that American strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it, and that weakness is the friend of danger and the enemy of peace.

END OF SUMMARY.
