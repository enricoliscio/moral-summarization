SUMMARY: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio shared his foreign policy vision, invoking President John F. Kennedy in support of a stronger American military presence and more aggressive assertion of power globally. Rubio believes that American strength prevents war, while weakness is the ally of danger. He criticized President Obama for his perceived belief that America is too hard on its adversaries and too engaged globally, instead favoring nation-building at home. Rubio's doctrine is guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy, and moral clarity. He has challenged the Obama administration's policies on Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine. Rubio accused Hillary Clinton of being negligent in her role as Secretary of State. When asked about the Iraq invasion, Rubio stated he would not have authorized it if he knew Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction. Rubio's foreign policy stance emphasizes the importance of American power and moral values in global affairs. END OF SUMMARY.
