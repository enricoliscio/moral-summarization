SUMMARY: Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican presidential candidate, presented his foreign policy vision, known as the "Rubio Doctrine," in a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations. Rubio advocated for a stronger U.S. military presence and a more aggressive assertion of American power globally, citing President John F. Kennedy's belief that American strength prevents war. He criticized President Obama's foreign policy approach, claiming that Obama believes America is too engaged in global affairs.

Rubio has been an active voice in foreign policy debates, opposing normalization of relations with Cuba, the Iran nuclear negotiations, and advocating for more support for Syrian rebels and Ukraine. He also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. When asked about the Iraq War, Rubio stated he would not have authorized the invasion if he knew Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction. Rubio's foreign policy vision emphasizes a more assertive and interventionist approach for the U.S.
