SUMMARY: Senator Marco Rubio lays out his foreign policy vision, invoking President John F. Kennedy's belief in American strength as a force for peace. Rubio accuses President Obama of disagreeing with this principle, believing that America is too hard on its adversaries and too engaged globally. Rubio's doctrine is guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy, and moral clarity. He has challenged the Obama administration's policies on Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine, advocating for a more aggressive assertion of American power. Rubio criticizes Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state and distances himself from Jeb Bush's comments on the Iraq invasion. He emphasizes the timelessness of Kennedy's beliefs, arguing that American strength prevents war and weakness empowers danger. Rubio believes that a stronger military budget and a more assertive America will make the world safer.
