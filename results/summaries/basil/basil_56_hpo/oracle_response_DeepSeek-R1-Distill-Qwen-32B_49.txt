Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too longâ€”under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rubio is outlining his foreign policy vision, comparing it to Kennedy's, emphasizing American strength and military budget. He's critical of Obama's approach, saying it leads to weakness and danger. He's also opposing Obama's policies on Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Ukraine. He criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure and mentioned his stance on the Iraq invasion.

Now, I need to identify the key moral words from the list: threats, understood, preventing, promoting, weakness, danger, enemy, disagrees, building, ceding, protection, clarity, help, negligent, trapped, destruction, favor. I'll incorporate these into the summary.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Rubio's main points, using the moral terms. Start with his vision, comparison to Kennedy, criticism of Obama's weakness leading to danger, his principles, opposition to Obama's policies, criticism of Clinton, and his stance on Iraq.

I should keep each sentence concise and make sure the flow is logical. Let me draft it, then check the word count and ensure all key points are included with the moral framing.

SUMMARY: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) presented a foreign policy vision, drawing parallels to President John F. Kennedy, emphasizing American strength as a means to prevent war and counter weakness, which he sees as a friend of danger and enemy of peace. He criticized President Obama for believing America was too engaged, advocating instead for a larger military budget and assertive global leadership. Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by principles of American strength, economic protection, and moral clarity. He opposes Obama's policies, including normalization with Cuba, nuclear talks with Iran, and support for Ukraine against Russia. Rubio also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state as ineffective or negligent. He rejected the 2003 Iraq invasion, stating he would not have favored it if Saddam Hussein lacked weapons of mass destruction. Rubio defended his approach as timeless, countering claims of being trapped in the past. END OF SUMMARY.
