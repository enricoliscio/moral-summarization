SUMMARY:

Senator Marco Rubio presented a foreign policy vision that emphasizes American strength and moral clarity, citing President John F. Kennedy as an inspiration. Rubio argued that a stronger US military and more assertive global presence would prevent war and promote peace. He criticized President Obama's approach, saying it is based on a false assumption that America's strength is a threat to peace, and that weakness invites danger. Rubio outlined his "Rubio Doctrine" based on three principles: American strength, economic protection, and moral clarity. He also took a swipe at Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, calling it "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." Rubio's vision is rooted in a moral framework that sees American power as a benevolent force, and weakness as a threat to global stability.

END OF SUMMARY.
