SUMMARY:

US Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) outlined his foreign policy vision, invoking President John F. Kennedy, and called for a stronger US military presence globally. Rubio believes that American strength prevents war, whereas weakness promotes danger. He criticized President Obama's approach, saying it has led to a decrease in American influence. Rubio's "Rubio Doctrine" is guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy, and moral clarity on core values. He has opposed Obama's efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, Iran nuclear negotiations, and has advocated for more support to Ukraine and Syria. Rubio also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state as "ineffective" and "negligent". When asked about invoking Kennedy, Rubio said the principles were "timeless" truths. He also stated that he would not have authorized the 2003 Iraq invasion if he knew Saddam Hussein didn't have WMDs.

END OF SUMMARY.
