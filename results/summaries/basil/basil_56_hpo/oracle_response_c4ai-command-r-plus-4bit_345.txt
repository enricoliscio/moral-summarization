SUMMARY: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio laid out his foreign policy vision, invoking President John F. Kennedy's assertion that American strength prevents war, not promotes it. Rubio criticized President Obama's approach, arguing that Obama believes American strength is a means of promoting war. Rubio's doctrine is guided by three principles: American strength, protection of the American economy, and moral clarity. He has challenged the Obama administration's efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, opposed negotiations with Iran, and advocated for more aggressive actions globally. Rubio believes that American influence is a benevolent force and that weakness is the friend of danger. He accused Obama of believing that America was too hard on its adversaries and too engaged globally, and that stepping back would make America better liked. Rubio also took a swipe at Hillary Clinton, calling her tenure as secretary of state negligent. In response to a question, Rubio stated that he would not have authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq, unlike Jeb Bush, who has faced criticism for a similar statement. Rubio's speech and doctrine emphasize the importance of American strength and assertiveness in global affairs while framing his position as a moral choice between strength and weakness, peace and danger.
END OF SUMMARY.
