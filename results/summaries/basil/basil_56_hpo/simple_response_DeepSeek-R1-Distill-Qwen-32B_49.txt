SUMMARY: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) outlined his foreign policy vision, drawing inspiration from President John F. Kennedy, emphasizing the need for American strength to prevent war and deter global threats. Rubio criticized President Obama's approach, arguing that reducing U.S. involvement abroad and focusing on "nation-building at home" weakens the country's influence and emboldens adversaries. He presented three guiding principles: American strength, protecting the economy in a globalized world, and moral clarity on core values. Rubio has opposed Obama's policies, including normalization with Cuba, nuclear negotiations with Iran, and support for Ukraine against Russian influence. He also criticized Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state as "ineffective" and "negligent." Rubio distanced himself from the Iraq invasion, stating he would not have supported it if Saddam Hussein lacked weapons of mass destruction, unlike Jeb Bush, who defended the decision despite its flaws. Rubio's speech aimed to present a "timeless" foreign policy framework, emphasizing American leadership and strength as a force for global stability. END OF SUMMARY.
