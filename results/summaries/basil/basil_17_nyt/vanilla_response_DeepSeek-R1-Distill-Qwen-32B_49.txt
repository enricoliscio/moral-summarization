Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Gov. Rick Perry's stance on immigration. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, the article starts by mentioning that Perry supports detaining and deporting every illegal alien caught. His aide clarifies it's not a roundup but deporting those found undocumented after an arrest. He criticizes Obama's "catch-and-release" policy as horrific. Supporters say this focuses on deporting serious criminals or threats.

Perry is trying to strengthen his immigration credentials ahead of the New Hampshire primary. He got an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for being tough on immigration. Arpaio praised Perry's efforts on the Texas-Mexico border.

But Perry faced criticism for supporting in-state tuition for some children of illegal immigrants. He apologized for calling opponents heartless. However, in New Hampshire, immigration isn't a top issue, and Arpaio is a polarizing figure due to a Justice Department lawsuit against him for possibly violating Hispanic rights.

The article also mentions Arizona's aggressive immigration laws leading to a recall of Sen. Pearce, who supported the controversial law. Perry says he wouldn't support suing states over such decisions if elected.

So, the summary should cover Perry's immigration policies, his endorsement by Arpaio, criticism over tuition, the New Hampshire primary context, Arpaio's controversial status, and Perry's stance on suing states.

I need to condense all this into a concise 200-word summary, highlighting key points without getting too detailed. Make sure to mention the main elements: Perry's deportation policy, the contrast with Obama, Arpaio's endorsement, the tuition issue, the primary context, Arpaio's lawsuit, and Perry's position on state lawsuits.

I should structure it to flow logically, starting with Perry's stance, then the endorsement, the criticism, the primary context, Arpaio's issues, and ending with Perry's legal stance. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has vowed to support a federal policy to detain and deport every undocumented immigrant apprehended, emphasizing an expedited hearing process. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, calling it "horrific," and sought to position himself as tough on immigration ahead of the New Hampshire primary. Perry received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his controversial immigration enforcement tactics. However, Perry faced criticism for previously supporting in-state tuition for some children of undocumented immigrants, an issue he apologized for. Despite Arpaio's polarizing reputation, Perry highlighted his efforts to strengthen border security. Immigration is not a top issue in New Hampshire, where Perry trails Mitt Romney in polls. Arpaio, who is embroiled in a Justice Department lawsuit over potential civil rights violations, remains a divisive figure. Perry also indicated he would not support federal lawsuits against states for their immigration policies. END OF SUMMARY.
