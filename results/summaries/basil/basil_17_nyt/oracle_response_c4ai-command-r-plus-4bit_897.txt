SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas made expansive comments about immigration policy, advocating for the detention and deportation of all illegal aliens apprehended, with expedited hearings. This stance aims to differentiate himself from the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy. He received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, known for his tough stance on immigration, but faces criticism for his support of in-state college tuition for children of illegal immigrants. Perry's comments come as he tries to shore up his credentials on immigration and win back Republican primary voters. The article also mentions the polarizing figure of Sheriff Arpaio, who is facing a lawsuit from the Justice Department for allegedly violating the rights of Hispanics, and the defeat of his ally, Arizona State Sen. Russell Pearce, in a recall election. Perry signaled he would not support the Justice Department's lawsuit if elected president.

END OF SUMMARY.
