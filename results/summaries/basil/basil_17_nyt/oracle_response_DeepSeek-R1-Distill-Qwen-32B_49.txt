Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Gov. Rick Perry and his immigration policies. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author used. They specifically mentioned some morally charged words like "detain," "deport," "immigration," "policy," "crimes," "does," "cooperating," "force," and "cooperate." 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Gov. Perry is supporting a federal policy to detain and deport undocumented immigrants after an expedited hearing. He's contrasting this with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which he criticizes as allowing nonviolent immigrants to be released. His campaign is trying to strengthen his stance on immigration, especially before the New Hampshire primary.

He got an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for tough immigration enforcement. However, Arpaio is controversial because of a lawsuit from the Justice Department regarding racial profiling. The article also mentions that immigration isn't a top issue for voters in New Hampshire, with only 4% citing it as most important.

Perry apologized for his previous comments on in-state tuition for children of undocumented immigrants, calling them "very inappropriate." He's trying to win back voters who think he's too soft on immigration. The summary should include the morally framed words and highlight the contrast between Perry's policy and the Obama administration, as well as the endorsement and its implications.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, around 200 words, and includes the key points while preserving the moral language. I'll structure it to mention Perry's policy, the criticism of Obama's approach, the endorsement by Arpaio, the controversy around Arpaio, and the voter sentiment on immigration.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has called for a federal policy to "detain and deport" every undocumented immigrant apprehended, emphasizing an expedited hearing process to expel those found to be undocumented. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, calling it "horrific," and sought to contrast his stance with their approach. Perry's comments came as he seeks to strengthen his immigration credentials ahead of the New Hampshire primary, having won an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his tough immigration enforcement. However, Arpaio is a polarizing figure due to a Justice Department lawsuit accusing his department of systematically violating Hispanic rights. Despite this, Arpaio remains popular in Arizona, though some in the state have begun to oppose aggressive immigration policies. Perry also apologized for his earlier controversial remarks on in-state tuition for children of undocumented immigrants, calling them "very inappropriate." Immigration remains a low-priority issue for New Hampshire Republicans, with only 4% citing it as their top concern. Perry's stance on deporting undocumented immigrants and his opposition to federal lawsuits against states over immigration policies highlight his effort to appeal to conservative voters. END OF SUMMARY.
