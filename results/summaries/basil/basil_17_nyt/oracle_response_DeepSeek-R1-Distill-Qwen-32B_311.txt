Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. 

Gov. Rick Perry is talking about a federal policy to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. He's contrasting his stance with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which he criticizes as allowing nonviolent immigrants to be released. His supporters say this focuses resources on deporting those who commit serious crimes or pose a threat. 

He's trying to strengthen his immigration credentials, especially with the New Hampshire primary approaching. He got an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for tough immigration enforcement. However, Arpaio is controversial because of the lawsuit against him for not cooperating with a federal investigation into rights violations, which the Justice Department sees as a systemic issue. 

Perry also apologized for his earlier comments about in-state tuition for children of undocumented immigrants, calling his previous statement "inappropriate." Despite this, immigration isn't a top issue in New Hampshire, and Perry is polling low there.

I need to make sure the summary includes the morally charged words like detain, deport, immigration, policy, crimes, cooperate, etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight Perry's stance, the contrast with Obama, the endorsement by Arpaio, the controversy around Arpaio, and Perry's apology. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has called for a federal policy to "detain and deport" every undocumented immigrant apprehended, emphasizing an expedited hearing process to expel those found to be undocumented. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, labeling it "horrific," and argued that his approach would focus on deporting those convicted of serious crimes or posing public safety threats. Perry, seeking to strengthen his immigration credentials ahead of the New Hampshire primary, secured an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his controversial enforcement tactics. However, Arpaio is a polarizing figure, facing a Justice Department lawsuit for allegedly not cooperating with an investigation into potential rights violations against Hispanics. Perry also apologized for his earlier comments defending in-state tuition for undocumented students, calling his prior statement "inappropriate." Despite these efforts, immigration remains a low priority for New Hampshire Republicans, with Perry trailing Mitt Romney in polls. END OF SUMMARY.
