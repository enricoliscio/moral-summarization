SUMMARY:
Texas Governor Rick Perry has taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, promising to detain and deport every undocumented immigrant apprehended. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy as "horrific" and vowed to prioritize deporting illegal immigrants who pose a threat to public safety or national interest. Perry's stance has drawn praise from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known as the "toughest sheriff" in the country, who endorsed Perry's efforts to secure the Texas-Mexico border. However, Perry's stance has also been criticized as "heartless" by some, and his apology for previous comments was deemed "inappropriate". The endorsement from Arpaio, a polarizing figure, may not help Perry in New Hampshire, where immigration is a low-priority issue for voters. END OF SUMMARY.
