SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has taken a hard-line stance on immigration, advocating for the detention and deportation of all undocumented immigrants apprehended, with an aide clarifying that this does not entail rounding up illegal immigrants. Perry criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, deeming it "horrific." Perry's stance on immigration has been a point of contention within his own party, particularly his support for a state plan offering in-state college tuition to some children of illegal immigrants. He has since apologized for calling those who opposed his position "heartless," deeming the comment "inappropriate." Perry received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, known for his aggressive stance on immigration and his controversial policies, such as forcing inmates to wear pink underwear. However, Arpaio is also facing a lawsuit from the Justice Department for allegedly violating the rights of Hispanics. Perry signaled he would not support the lawsuit if elected president, stating the federal government should not interfere with state decisions. The article notes that immigration may not be a top issue for Republican voters in New Hampshire, where Perry trails Mitt Romney in the polls. END OF SUMMARY.
