SUMMARY:
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, promising to detain and deport every undocumented immigrant apprehended. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy as "horrific" and claimed it allows nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the public. Perry's plan would involve expedited hearings and deportation, which he believes would prioritize public safety and national interest. His stance has earned him an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough immigration policies and controversial methods. However, Perry's views have been criticized by some as "heartless," and his apology for previously suggesting that opponents were heartless has not fully redeemed him. The endorsement from the polarizing Sheriff Arpaio may not significantly boost Perry's polling numbers in New Hampshire. END OF SUMMARY.
