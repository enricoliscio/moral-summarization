SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has taken a hardline stance on illegal immigration, calling for the detention and deportation of all undocumented immigrants apprehended by authorities. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which allows some nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the community. Perry's plan would involve expedited hearings for those detained, followed by deportation. His stance has earned him an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his tough stance on immigration. However, Arpaio is a polarizing figure, and his endorsement may not help Perry in New Hampshire, where immigration is not a top concern for voters. Perry's plan has also been criticized for being too harsh, and his previous support for in-state tuition for children of illegal immigrants has been seen as too soft by some Republicans.

END OF SUMMARY.
