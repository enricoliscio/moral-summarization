SUMMARY:
Governor Rick Perry of Texas has taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, calling for the detention and deportation of every undocumented immigrant apprehended. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, labeling it "horrific". Perry's plan is to expedite hearings and deport undocumented immigrants, focusing resources on those who pose a threat to public safety or national interest. His stance has drawn criticism from within his own party, particularly for supporting a state plan that grants in-state college tuition to children of illegal immigrants. Perry has apologized for calling opponents of this plan "heartless". The Texas governor has won an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his aggressive immigration policies and controversial methods. However, Arpaio's polarizing figure and lawsuit against him for allegedly violating Hispanics' rights may not help Perry's campaign in New Hampshire, where immigration is not a top concern for voters. END OF SUMMARY.
