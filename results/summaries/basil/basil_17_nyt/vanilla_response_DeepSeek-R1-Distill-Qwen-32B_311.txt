Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Gov. Rick Perry's stance on immigration. Let me read through the article first.

So, the article starts with Perry saying he supports detaining and deporting every illegal alien apprehended. His aide clarifies it's not a roundup but expelling those found undocumented after an expedited hearing. He's contrasting this with Obama's "catch-and-release" policy, which he criticizes as horrific. Supporters say this focuses on deporting serious criminals or threats.

Then, Perry got an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who's known for being tough on immigration. Arpaio praised Perry's efforts on the border with Texas Rangers. However, Perry was criticized for supporting in-state tuition for some children of illegal immigrants, which he apologized for, trying to win back voters.

The article mentions that immigration isn't a top issue in New Hampshire, only 4% citing it as most important. Arpaio is a polarizing figure with a lawsuit against him for possible rights violations, but he's popular in Arizona despite that. A state senator who supported strict immigration laws was defeated, showing some pushback against such policies. Perry also said he wouldn't support the federal lawsuit against Arizona's law if elected.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Perry's policy, the clarification, his criticism of Obama, the endorsement by Arpaio, his past controversy, the poll numbers, Arpaio's situation, and Perry's stance on the lawsuit.

Make sure to include key points: Perry's deportation plan, the contrast with Obama, Arpaio's endorsement, the in-state tuition controversy, the 4% poll, Arpaio's legal issues, and Perry's opposition to the lawsuit.

Now, structure it clearly, ensuring it's concise and covers all main points without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has outlined a federal immigration policy to detain and deport all undocumented immigrants apprehended, emphasizing an expedited hearing process. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, calling it "horrific," and sought to differentiate his stance by focusing on deporting serious criminals or public threats. Perry received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his tough immigration enforcement, who praised Perry's border efforts. However, Perry faced criticism for supporting in-state tuition for children of undocumented immigrants, an issue he apologized for, aiming to regain favor with Republican voters. Despite this, immigration ranks low as an issue in New Hampshire, with only 4% of voters citing it as critical. Arpaio, a polarizing figure, faces a federal lawsuit over rights violations, though he remains popular in Arizona. Recently, a state senator who backed strict immigration laws was defeated, indicating growing opposition. Perry also stated he would not support federal lawsuits against states for their immigration policies if elected. END OF SUMMARY.
