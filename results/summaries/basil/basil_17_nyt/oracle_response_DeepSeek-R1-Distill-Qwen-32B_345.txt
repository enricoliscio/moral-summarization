Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure those words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Gov. Rick Perry is talking about immigration policy, detention, and deportation. He's trying to position himself against the Obama administration's policies. He's also getting endorsements, but there's criticism about his past stance on in-state tuition for immigrants.

I should focus on the key elements: Perry's support for detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants, the contrast with the Obama administration, Sheriff Arpaio's endorsement, and the criticism regarding tuition policies. Also, mention the Justice Department's lawsuit against Arpaio for civil rights violations.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and include the specified moral words. I'll structure it to highlight Perry's stance, his contrast with Obama, the endorsement, and the criticisms, making sure to use words like 'detain,' 'deport,' 'policy,' 'crimes,' etc.

Let me draft that, ensuring it's concise and includes all necessary points while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has called for a federal policy to detain and deport every undocumented immigrant apprehended, emphasizing an expedited hearing process to expel those found to be undocumented. He criticized the Obama administration’s “catch-and-release” policy, calling it “horrific,” and sought to differentiate himself by focusing on deporting those who pose a threat to public safety or national interest. Perry’s stance on immigration is part of his efforts to appeal to Republican primary voters, especially after criticism for supporting in-state tuition for children of undocumented immigrants. He apologized for a controversial remark, labeling it “very inappropriate,” as he seeks to regain support.  

Perry has received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his tough immigration enforcement policies. However, Arpaio is a polarizing figure, facing a Justice Department lawsuit for allegedly violating Hispanic rights. Despite this, Arpaio remains popular in his state, though Arizona’s aggressive immigration policies have begun to face backlash.  

Perry also signaled opposition to federal lawsuits against states over immigration policies, arguing that states should have the right to make decisions in the best interest of their citizens. His comments reflect a broader debate over immigration enforcement and cooperation between federal and state authorities.  
END OF SUMMARY.
