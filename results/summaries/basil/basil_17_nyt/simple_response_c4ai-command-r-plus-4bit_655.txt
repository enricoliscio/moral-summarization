SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas proposed a controversial immigration policy, suggesting the deportation of all illegal aliens apprehended, regardless of their individual circumstances. This hard-line approach was likely an attempt to bolster his credentials on immigration and appeal to Republican primary voters who value strong border control. He received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, known for his tough stance on immigration, but faced criticism for his support of a state plan providing in-state college tuition for some children of illegal immigrants. Perry's stance on immigration has drawn mixed reactions, with some praising his commitment to securing the border, while others criticize him for his previous comments suggesting that those who opposed his position lacked compassion. This highlights the complex and divisive nature of immigration reform in the United States, where different moral frameworks clash. It remains to be seen whether Perry's stance will help him gain traction in the New Hampshire primary, where rival Mitt Romney currently leads. Additionally, the endorsement from the controversial Sheriff Arpaio may not provide the boost Perry seeks, given the polarizing nature of the sheriff's aggressive immigration policies.

END OF SUMMARY.
