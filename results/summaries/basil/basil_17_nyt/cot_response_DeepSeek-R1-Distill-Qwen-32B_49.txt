Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral terms used.

The article is about Governor Rick Perry of Texas and his stance on immigration. He supports detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants, contrasting it with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which he calls "horrific." He's trying to strengthen his position on immigration, especially with the New Hampshire primary approaching. He's received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who's known for tough immigration policies but is also controversial due to allegations of racial profiling and rights violations.

I need to identify all the single words that carry moral connotations. Words like "detain," "deport," "illegal," "horrific," "toughest," "endorsement," "controversial," "heartless," "apology," "inappropriate," "polarizing," "intimidate," "racial profiling," "aggressive," "recall," "controversial," "suing." These words are key because they carry moral judgments.

Next, I'll summarize the article, making sure to include these morally framed words. I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I need to be concise. The summary should highlight Perry's policy, his criticism of Obama's approach, his endorsement by Arpaio, the controversy around Arpaio, and Perry's stance on the lawsuit against Arizona's immigration law.

I also need to structure the response with STEP 1 listing each moral word and then the summary. I have to make sure the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's content while preserving the moral framing.

Let me make sure I cover all the points: Perry's policy, the contrast with Obama, the endorsement by Arpaio, the criticism of Perry's tuition policy, his apology, the polarizing nature of Arpaio, the lawsuit against Arpaio, and Perry's stance on the Arizona law. I'll weave these elements into a coherent summary, ensuring that the moral terms are included to maintain the author's framing.

I think I've got all the key elements. Time to put it all together clearly and concisely.

**SUMMARY:**  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has endorsed a federal policy to detain and deport undocumented immigrants, criticizing the Obama administrationâ€™s "catch-and-release" policy as "horrific." He emphasized deporting those found to be undocumented after an expedited hearing, focusing on serious criminals or threats. Perry, seeking to strengthen his immigration credentials, won an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his "toughest" immigration enforcement. However, Arpaio is a polarizing figure, facing accusations of racial profiling and rights violations. Perry has also apologized for calling opponents of his in-state tuition policy "heartless," acknowledging it was "inappropriate." Despite his efforts, immigration ranks low as an issue for New Hampshire Republicans. Perry also opposes federal lawsuits against states for their immigration policies, signaling he would not sue Arizona over its controversial law. END OF SUMMARY.
