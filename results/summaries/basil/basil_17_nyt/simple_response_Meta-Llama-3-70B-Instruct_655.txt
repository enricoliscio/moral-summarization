SUMMARY:

Governor Rick Perry of Texas has taken a hardline stance on illegal immigration, calling for the detention and deportation of all undocumented immigrants apprehended by authorities. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which allows nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the public. Perry's plan is to expedite hearings and deport undocumented immigrants, focusing resources on those who have committed serious crimes or pose a threat to public safety. His stance has drawn criticism from within his own party, but he has won the endorsement of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration. However, Arpaio's controversial reputation and the Justice Department's lawsuit against him for alleged racial profiling may not help Perry's campaign in New Hampshire, where immigration is not a top priority for voters.

END OF SUMMARY.
