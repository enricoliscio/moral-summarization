Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Gov. Rick Perry's immigration stance. They also mentioned that I need to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Hmm, I should make sure I capture the nuances of the arguments and criticisms presented.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Perry is supporting a federal policy to deport all undocumented immigrants caught, but his aide clarifies it's not a roundup. He's contrasting this with Obama's "catch-and-release" policy, which he calls horrific. He's trying to strengthen his immigration credentials, especially since he's trailing in the polls.

Then there's Sheriff Joe Arpaio's endorsement, which is a bit controversial. Arpaio is known for tough immigration enforcement, but he's also under legal scrutiny for potential rights violations. The article mentions that immigration isn't a top issue for voters in New Hampshire, which might affect Perry's strategy.

I need to make sure the summary includes Perry's support for deporting undocumented immigrants, his criticism of Obama's policy, the endorsement by Arpaio, and the context of Arpaio's controversial reputation. Also, note that immigration isn't a major issue in the primary, so the impact of the endorsement might be limited.

I should structure the summary to highlight Perry's tough stance, the clarification from his aide, the contrast with Obama, the endorsement, and the mixed reception of Arpaio. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure the moral aspects are clear, like the criticism of the "catch-and-release" policy and the potential rights issues with Arpaio's methods.

Let me draft that, making sure to include all key points without going over the word limit. I'll check that the moral framing is preserved, showing both Perry's tough approach and the controversies surrounding it.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has endorsed a federal policy to deport all undocumented immigrants apprehended, emphasizing an expedited hearing process for those found to be in the country illegally. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, calling it "horrific," and sought to contrast his stance with their approach. Perry's comments came as he sought to strengthen his immigration credentials ahead of the New Hampshire primary, following criticism for supporting in-state tuition for children of undocumented immigrants. He apologized for previously calling opponents of the policy "heartless."  

Perry received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his controversial immigration enforcement tactics. However, Arpaio is a polarizing figure, facing a federal lawsuit over allegations of rights violations against Hispanics. Despite his notoriety, Arpaio remains popular in Arizona, though some in the state have begun to oppose aggressive immigration policies.  

Perry also indicated he would not support federal lawsuits against states for their immigration policies if elected president, aligning with a "states' rights" approach. Immigration remains a low priority issue for New Hampshire Republican voters, with only 4% citing it as their top concern. END OF SUMMARY.
