SUMMARY:
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, calling for the detention and deportation of every undocumented immigrant apprehended. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy as "horrific" and sought to draw a contrast with his own approach. Perry's stance has earned him an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his aggressive immigration policies and controversial methods. However, Perry's views on immigration have been criticized by some as "heartless," and his apology for previously calling opponents of his stance "heartless" was seen as "inappropriate." Despite this, Perry remains committed to his stance, and has signaled that he would not support the continuation of a lawsuit against Arizona's immigration law if elected president. END OF SUMMARY.
