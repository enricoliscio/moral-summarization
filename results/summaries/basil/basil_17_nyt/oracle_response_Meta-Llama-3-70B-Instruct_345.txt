SUMMARY: 
Texas Governor Rick Perry has called for a federal policy to "detain and deport every illegal alien that we apprehend," contrasting with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy. Perry's plan would involve expediting hearings for undocumented individuals arrested or detained, and then deporting them. He criticized the current policy as "horrific," saying it allows nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the public. Perry's stance is endorsed by Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration. Arpaio praised Perry's efforts to interdict illegal crossings by sending Texas Rangers to the border. However, Perry has faced criticism for supporting a state plan that gives in-state college tuition to children of illegal immigrants. He apologized for calling opponents of the plan "heartless." The endorsement from Arpaio, who is facing a lawsuit for allegedly violating Hispanics' rights, may not significantly boost Perry's polling in New Hampshire. 
END OF SUMMARY.
