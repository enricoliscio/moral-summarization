SUMMARY: Governor Rick Perry of Texas has stated that he supports a federal policy to detain and deport all illegal aliens apprehended in the country. This is an attempt to shore up his credentials on immigration and contrast himself with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy. Perry has faced criticism within his party for his stance on immigration, particularly for backing a state plan that provides in-state college tuition for some children of illegal immigrants. He has since apologized for his comments defending the plan. In an effort to boost his credentials, Perry received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, known for his tough stance on immigration. However, Arpaio is a polarizing figure, currently being sued by the Justice Department for allegedly violating the rights of Hispanics. Despite his popularity in Arizona, there are signs that the state's aggressive immigration policies may be losing support. Perry has signaled that he would not support the Justice Department's lawsuit if he were elected president. END OF SUMMARY.
