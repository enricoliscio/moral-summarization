Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the article is about Governor Rick Perry's stance on immigration. He supports detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants after an expedited hearing. He contrasts this with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which he criticizes as horrific. His aim is to focus on deporting those who are threats or have serious crimes.

Perry got an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for tough immigration enforcement. However, Arpaio is controversial because of a lawsuit against him by the Justice Department for potential rights violations. Despite this, Arpaio is popular in Arizona but has polarizing views.

Perry also apologized for his earlier comments on in-state tuition for some children of undocumented immigrants, calling it inappropriate. He's trying to regain support among Republicans, but immigration isn't a top issue in New Hampshire, where he's trailing Romney.

I need to capture the moral aspects: Perry's tough stance on immigration, the criticism of the Obama policy, the controversial endorsement, and the broader implications of immigration enforcement versus civil rights.

I should structure the summary to include Perry's policy, his criticism of Obama, Arpaio's endorsement, the controversy around Arpaio, Perry's apology, and the context of the New Hampshire primary.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed. Make sure to highlight the moral framing, like the contrast between security and rights, and the controversial nature of Arpaio.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring all key points are included succinctly.

SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has called for a federal policy to detain and deport all undocumented immigrants apprehended, emphasizing an expedited hearing process to focus on deporting those posing public safety risks or threats. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy as "horrific," aiming to contrast his approach. Perry received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his strict immigration enforcement, though Arpaio faces criticism for potential rights violations. Perry also apologized for earlier comments on in-state tuition for children of undocumented immigrants, acknowledging the issue's sensitivity. Despite his efforts, immigration ranks low as a concern among New Hampshire Republicans, with Perry trailing Mitt Romney in polls. END OF SUMMARY.
