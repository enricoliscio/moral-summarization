Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Gov. Rick Perry's stance on immigration. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Hmm, first, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the tone.

The article starts by mentioning Perry's support for detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants upon apprehension. He's contrasting this with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which he criticizes. His aide clarifies that it's not a roundup but expelling those found undocumented after an expedited hearing. So, the moral framing here is about security and responsibility, maybe.

Then, Perry gets endorsed by Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who's controversial. The article mentions that Arpaio is seen as tough but also polarizing because of the Justice Department's lawsuit against him. This adds a moral dimension about law enforcement's methods and potential civil rights issues.

Perry's past support for in-state tuition for some undocumented students was criticized, and he apologized, showing he's trying to appeal to the Republican base. This reflects on his shift from a more moderate stance to a harder line on immigration, perhaps to gain votes.

The article also notes that immigration isn't a top issue in New Hampshire, which is where the primary is. This might suggest that Perry's focus on immigration might not be as impactful there. Additionally, the mention of Arizona's recall of Sen. Pearce indicates a shift even in states with strict immigration laws, showing that public opinion might be changing.

Putting it all together, the summary should highlight Perry's tough immigration stance, his endorsement by Arpaio, the criticism of the Obama administration, his apology, and the broader context of immigration's role in the campaign and public opinion. I need to keep it under 200 words and ensure the moral aspects are clearâ€”like security vs. civil rights, and the political strategy behind his moves.

I should structure the summary to first state Perry's policy, then the context of his campaign, the endorsement, the criticism, his apology, and the broader implications. Keeping each point concise but informative. Also, make sure to mention the contrasting views and the polarizing nature of Arpaio to show the moral framing.

Wait, did I miss any key points? Let me check: Perry's comments on the Obama policy, the clarification from his aide, the endorsement by Arpaio, his past criticism for tuition policy, the apology, the poll on immigration's importance, Arpaio's lawsuit, and Pearce's recall. Yeah, I think I covered those.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, starting with Perry's stance, then his campaign moves, the endorsement, the criticisms, and the broader context. That should encapsulate the moral framing around security, rights, and political strategy.

SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has reaffirmed his tough stance on immigration, advocating for the detention and deportation of all undocumented immigrants upon apprehension. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, calling it "horrific," and emphasized focusing on deporting those who pose threats to public safety or national security. Perry's comments came as he sought to strengthen his credentials on immigration ahead of the New Hampshire primary, securing an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, a polarizing figure known for his strict enforcement policies. Arpaio praised Perry's efforts to secure the Texas-Mexico border. However, Perry has faced criticism for previously supporting in-state tuition for some undocumented students, a stance he later apologized for, calling his earlier remarks "inappropriate." Despite his efforts, immigration remains a low priority for New Hampshire Republicans, with only 4% citing it as their top issue. Arpaio's endorsement may not significantly boost Perry's campaign, as the sheriff is controversial due to a Justice Department lawsuit alleging civil rights violations against Hispanics. Meanwhile, Perry has distanced himself from Arizona's strict immigration law, signaling he would not support federal lawsuits against states for such policies. END OF SUMMARY.
