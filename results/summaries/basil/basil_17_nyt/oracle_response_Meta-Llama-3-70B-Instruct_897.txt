SUMMARY: Texas Governor Rick Perry has taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, calling for the detention and deportation of every undocumented immigrant apprehended by authorities. Perry criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, labeling it "horrific." Instead, he advocates for expedited hearings to deport non-violent illegal immigrants. Perry's stance has earned him an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough immigration policies. However, Perry's views have been met with criticism from within his own party, particularly for his support of in-state college tuition for children of illegal immigrants. Perry has since apologized for calling opponents of his stance "heartless." The endorsement from Arpaio, who is facing a lawsuit from the Justice Department for allegedly violating the rights of Hispanics, may not resonate with all voters. Perry's stance on immigration remains a key issue in his presidential campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
