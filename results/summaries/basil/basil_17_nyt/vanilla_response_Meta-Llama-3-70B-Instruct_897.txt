SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has stated that he would support a federal policy to detain and deport every illegal alien apprehended, calling the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy "horrific". Perry's plan would involve expedited hearings for those arrested and found to be undocumented, followed by deportation. He has also received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his tough stance on immigration. Arpaio praised Perry's efforts to interdict illegal crossings at the Texas-Mexico border. Perry has been trying to shore up his credentials on immigration, which has been a controversial issue for him in the past. He has apologized for previously suggesting that those who opposed his stance on in-state tuition for children of illegal immigrants were heartless. The endorsement from Arpaio may not have a significant impact in New Hampshire, where immigration is not a top concern for voters.

END OF SUMMARY.
