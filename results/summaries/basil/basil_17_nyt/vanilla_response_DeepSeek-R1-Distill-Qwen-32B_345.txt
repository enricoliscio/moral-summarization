Alright, I need to summarize this article about Gov. Rick Perry's stance on immigration. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, the main points are: Perry supports detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants found after arrest. He's contrasting this with Obama's "catch-and-release" policy. He's trying to strengthen his immigration credentials, especially with the New Hampshire primary approaching. He got an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who's a tough figure on immigration. But Perry also faced criticism for supporting in-state tuition for some children of undocumented immigrants, which made him apologize.

Additionally, the article mentions the controversial Arizona immigration law and the Justice Department's lawsuit against Arpaio. It also notes that immigration isn't a top issue in New Hampshire, with only 4% citing it as important.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by highlighting Perry's policy, the contrast with Obama, his endorsement by Arpaio, the criticism he faced, and the broader context of the Arizona situation. I should keep it concise, making sure each key point is covered without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: introduce Perry's stance, mention the contrast with Obama, his endorsement, the criticism and apology, the Arizona law and lawsuit, and the low priority of immigration in New Hampshire. That should cover all the main elements succinctly.

SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has stated his support for a federal policy to detain and deport undocumented immigrants upon apprehension, emphasizing an expedited hearing process. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, calling it "horrific," and aimed to differentiate himself on immigration enforcement. Perry received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his strict immigration policies, but faces criticism for previously backing in-state tuition for children of undocumented immigrants. He apologized for a controversial remark, attempting to regain support among Republican primary voters. Immigration remains a low-priority issue in New Hampshire, where Perry trails Mitt Romney in polls. Arpaio, a polarizing figure, has faced a Justice Department lawsuit over allegations of rights violations against Hispanics. Meanwhile, Perry opposes federal lawsuits against states for their immigration policies, signaling a potential shift if elected. END OF SUMMARY.
