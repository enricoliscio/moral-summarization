Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Gov. Rick Perry's stance on immigration. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

Perry supports detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants upon apprehension, contrasting with Obama's "catch-and-release" policy. He's trying to strengthen his immigration credentials, especially before the New Hampshire primary. He got an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for tough immigration enforcement. However, Perry faced criticism for supporting in-state tuition for some immigrants' children and apologized for calling opponents heartless.

I should note that while Perry wants to deport all undocumented immigrants, his aide clarified it's only those arrested or detained, not a roundup. The article mentions that immigration isn't a top issue in New Hampshire, and Arpaio is a polarizing figure due to the Justice Department's lawsuit against him for potential rights violations.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: Perry's policy, the contrast with Obama, the endorsement from Arpaio, the criticism he faced, and the broader context of immigration as a less critical issue in the primary. I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing, like the "horrific policy" and the criticism of his previous stance.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these elements concisely, ensuring it flows logically and covers all necessary aspects without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has vowed to support a federal policy to detain and deport all undocumented immigrants apprehended in the U.S., contrasting with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which he called "horrific." Perry emphasized that his stance does not involve rounding up immigrants but rather deporting those arrested or detained after an expedited hearing. He sought to strengthen his immigration credentials ahead of the New Hampshire primary, securing an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his tough immigration enforcement. However, Perry faced criticism for previously backing in-state tuition for some children of undocumented immigrants, which led him to apologize for calling opponents "heartless." Despite Arpaio's support, immigration remains a low-priority issue for New Hampshire Republicans, with only 4% citing it as most important. Arpaio, a polarizing figure, is under federal investigation for potential rights violations against Hispanics. Perry also indicated he would not support lawsuits against states for their immigration policies if elected president. END OF SUMMARY.
