SUMMARY:

Governor Rick Perry of Texas has taken a hardline stance on illegal immigration, calling for the detention and deportation of all undocumented immigrants apprehended by authorities. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which allows some nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the public. Perry's stance is in stark contrast to his previous support for a Texas plan that provides in-state college tuition to children of illegal immigrants, which was seen as too soft on immigration. The governor has since apologized for calling opponents of the plan "heartless." Perry's tough stance on immigration has earned him an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his aggressive immigration policies. However, Arpaio's polarizing figure and controversial methods may not help Perry's campaign in New Hampshire, where immigration is not a top concern for voters.

END OF SUMMARY.
