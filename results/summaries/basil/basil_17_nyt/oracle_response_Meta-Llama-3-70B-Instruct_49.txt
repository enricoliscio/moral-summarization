SUMMARY: 
Texas Governor Rick Perry has taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, vowing to "detain and deport every illegal alien" apprehended, in contrast to the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy. Perry's plan involves expedited hearings for undocumented immigrants, followed by deportation. He criticized the current policy as "horrific" and claimed it allows nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the public. Perry's stance has earned him an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his aggressive immigration policies. However, Perry's position has been met with criticism from within his own party, particularly for his support of in-state college tuition for children of illegal immigrants. Perry has since apologized for calling opponents of his position "heartless." The endorsement from Arpaio, who is facing a lawsuit for allegedly violating Hispanics' rights, may not significantly boost Perry's polling numbers in New Hampshire. END OF SUMMARY.
