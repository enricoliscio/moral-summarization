Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Gov. Rick Perry and his stance on immigration. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Perry supports a federal policy to detain and deport every illegal alien apprehended. He clarified that it's not a roundup but rather expelling those found undocumented after an expedited hearing. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, calling it horrific. Supporters of his policy say it allows focusing on deporting serious criminals or threats.

Perry is trying to strengthen his immigration credentials, especially with the New Hampshire primary approaching. He got an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance. Arpaio praised Perry's efforts to send law enforcement to the Texas-Mexico border. 

However, Perry faced criticism for supporting in-state tuition for children of undocumented immigrants, which some saw as too lenient. He apologized for calling opponents heartless, trying to win back voters. Despite Arpaio's endorsement, immigration isn't a top issue in New Hampshire, with only 4% citing it as most important. Arpaio is controversial due to a Justice Department lawsuit accusing him of rights violations against Hispanics, which he denies.

The article also mentions that Arizona's aggressive immigration laws are starting to lose support, as seen with Sen. Pearce's defeat. Perry indicated he wouldn't support lawsuits against states for their immigration policies if elected.

So, the key points are Perry's tough immigration stance, his policy details, endorsement by Arpaio, his past criticism and apology, the controversy around Arpaio, and the shift in public opinion on immigration policies in Arizona.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary of no more than 200 words, making sure to include all main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has called for a federal policy to detain and deport all undocumented immigrants apprehended, contrasting it with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which he criticized as harmful. Perry emphasized focusing on deporting those with criminal records or posing public safety risks. He sought to strengthen his immigration credentials ahead of the New Hampshire primary, securing an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his stringent immigration enforcement. Arpaio praised Perry's border enforcement efforts, though Perry has faced criticism for supporting in-state tuition for undocumented students, leading him to apologize for previous controversial remarks. Despite Arpaio's backing, immigration is a low priority for New Hampshire Republicans, with only 4% citing it as a top issue. Arpaio remains controversial due to a Justice Department lawsuit alleging rights violations against Hispanics, which he denies. Meanwhile, Arizona's tough immigration laws are losing support, as seen in the recall of Sen. Russell Pearce. Perry also indicated he would not support federal lawsuits against states over immigration policies. END OF SUMMARY.
