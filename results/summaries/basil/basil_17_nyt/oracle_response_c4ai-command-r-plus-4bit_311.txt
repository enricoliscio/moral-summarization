SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has made expansive comments about immigration policy, stating his support for a federal policy to "detain and deport every illegal alien that we apprehend." Perry's stance contrasts with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which allows nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the general public. Backers of the current policy argue that it allows resources to be focused on deporting illegal immigrants who pose a threat to public safety or national interest. Perry's hardline stance on immigration has drawn criticism within his own party, particularly for his support of a state plan offering lower-cost in-state college tuition to some children of illegal immigrants. He has since apologized for his comments and is trying to shore up his credentials on immigration. He received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, known for his tough stance on immigration, but it remains to be seen how much this will help Perry in the polls. The article also discusses the controversial policies of Sheriff Arpaio, who has been accused of systematically violating the rights of Hispanics, and the recall election of Arizona State Sen. Russell Pearce, who pushed through a law to turn police officers into immigration agents. Perry has signaled his opposition to the federal government's lawsuit against Maricopa County, stating that states should have the right to make decisions in the best interests of their citizens.
END OF SUMMARY.
