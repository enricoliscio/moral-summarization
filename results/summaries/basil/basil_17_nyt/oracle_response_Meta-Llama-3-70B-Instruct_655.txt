SUMMARY: 
Governor Rick Perry of Texas has taken a strong stance on illegal immigration, calling for the detention and deportation of every undocumented immigrant apprehended. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, labeling it "horrific". Perry's plan involves expedited hearings for those found to be undocumented, after which they would be expelled from the country. He drew a contrast with the current policy, which focuses on deporting illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes or pose a threat to public safety or national interest. Perry's stance has earned him an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration. However, Arpaio's polarizing figure and controversial methods, including allegations of racial profiling, may not help Perry's campaign in New Hampshire, where immigration is not a top concern for voters. Perry's efforts to shore up his credentials on immigration come as he tries to regain ground in the Republican primary. 
END OF SUMMARY.
