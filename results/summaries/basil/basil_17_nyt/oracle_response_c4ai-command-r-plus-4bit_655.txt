SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas advocated for a federal policy of detention and deportation of all illegal aliens apprehended, contrasting it with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy. He sought to strengthen his credentials on immigration by receiving an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, known for his tough stance on immigration. However, Perry's stance on immigration has been controversial within his own party, particularly his support for a state plan offering lower-cost in-state college tuition to some children of illegal immigrants. He apologized for his previous comment suggesting that those who opposed his position were heartless. Perry's focus on immigration may not have a significant impact on voters in New Hampshire, where a recent poll showed that only 4% of likely Republican voters cited immigration as the most important issue. Sheriff Arpaio, while popular in his state, has also faced criticism and a lawsuit from the Justice Department for allegedly violating the rights of Hispanics. Perry signaled that he would not support the lawsuit against Arpaio if he were elected president.
END OF SUMMARY.
