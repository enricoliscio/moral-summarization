SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has stated that he would support a federal policy to detain and deport all illegal immigrants who are apprehended. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which allows some nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the public. Perry's stance is in contrast to his previous support for a Texas plan that gives in-state college tuition to children of illegal immigrants. He has apologized for calling opponents of the plan "heartless". Perry has received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his tough stance on immigration. However, Arpaio is a polarizing figure, and it remains to be seen how much his endorsement will help Perry in the New Hampshire primary. Perry is currently polling behind Mitt Romney, and immigration is not a top issue for Republican voters in the state.

END OF SUMMARY.
