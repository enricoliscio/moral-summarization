Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Gov. Rick Perry's stance on immigration. 

First, I should identify the morally framed words. The article uses words like "detain," "deport," "illegal aliens," "catch-and-release," "horrific," "focus," "public safety," "toughest," "endorsement," "interdict," "heartless," "apology," "inappropriate," "polarizing," "racial profiling," "intimidate," "aggressive," "controversial," "suing." These words carry moral connotations, so I need to make sure they're included in the summary.

Next, I need to write a concise summary. The key points are Perry's support for deporting undocumented immigrants, his criticism of Obama's policies, the endorsement by Sheriff Arpaio, his apology for past comments, and the broader context of immigration as a minor issue in New Hampshire. Also, mention Arpaio's controversial reputation and the legal challenges against him.

I should structure the summary to include these points, using the morally framed words where appropriate. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I need to be concise but comprehensive.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the key elements and the moral framing words. I'll start with Perry's stance, then the endorsement, his apology, the poll results, Arpaio's situation, and the implications for Perry's campaign.

I should also ensure the summary flows well and covers all necessary aspects without being too verbose. After drafting, I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has vowed to support a federal policy to detain and deport all undocumented immigrants apprehended, criticizing the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy as "horrific." He emphasized deporting those found to be undocumented after an expedited hearing, focusing on public safety and national interest. Perry sought endorsements, including from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough immigration enforcement, to strengthen his credentials. However, Perry faced criticism for backing in-state tuition for children of undocumented immigrants, calling opponents "heartless," and later apologized for the comment. Despite Arpaio's endorsement, immigration remains a low-priority issue in New Hampshire, where Perry trails Mitt Romney. Arpaio, a polarizing figure, faces legal challenges for alleged racial profiling, yet remains popular in Arizona. Perry also signaled opposition to federal lawsuits against states for immigration policies, signaling a potential shift in federal-state relations. END OF SUMMARY.
