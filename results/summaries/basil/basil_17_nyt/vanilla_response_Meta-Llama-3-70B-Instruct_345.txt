SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry stated that he would support a federal policy to detain and deport all illegal immigrants who are apprehended. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which allows some nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the public. Perry's stance is an effort to shore up his credentials on immigration, particularly after being criticized for supporting a state plan that gives children of illegal immigrants in-state college tuition. He has since apologized for calling opponents of the plan "heartless." Perry has also received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, who is known for his tough stance on immigration. However, Arpaio is a polarizing figure, and it remains to be seen how much his endorsement will help Perry in the New Hampshire primary. Perry is currently polling behind Mitt Romney in the state.

END OF SUMMARY.
