SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, seeking to shore up his credentials on immigration, received the endorsement of Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, who is known for his tough stance on illegal immigration. Perry has been criticized within his own party for backing a state plan that provides in-state college tuition for some children of illegal immigrants and has been trying to win back Republican primary voters by taking a harder line on immigration. Perry stated that he would support a federal policy to detain and deport every illegal alien apprehended, drawing a contrast with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy. He also suggested that he would not support the Justice Department's lawsuit against Arpaio for allegedly violating the rights of Hispanics, arguing that the federal government should not interfere with state decisions. However, it remains uncertain how much Arpaio's endorsement will help Perry in the New Hampshire primary, where immigration is not a top issue for most Republican voters. Furthermore, Arpaio's aggressive immigration policies have faced increasing opposition, with a recent recall election in Arizona defeating a supporter of a controversial immigration law. END OF SUMMARY.
