SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas stated he would support a federal policy to detain and deport every illegal alien apprehended in the country. He clarified that he was not suggesting rounding up illegal immigrants but instead calling for expedited hearings and deportations for those found to be undocumented after being arrested or detained. Perry sought to differentiate himself from the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which allows nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the general public. He also received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, known for his tough stance on immigration. Perry apologized again for his past support of a state plan that gives children of illegal immigrants in-state college tuition, a position that drew criticism from within his own party. However, it is unclear how much the endorsement from Arpaio will help Perry in New Hampshire, where immigration is not a top issue for most Republican voters. Additionally, Arpaio is a polarizing figure due to his aggressive immigration policies and a lawsuit filed against him by the Justice Department for allegedly violating the rights of Hispanics. Perry signaled he would not support the lawsuit if elected president.
END OF SUMMARY.
