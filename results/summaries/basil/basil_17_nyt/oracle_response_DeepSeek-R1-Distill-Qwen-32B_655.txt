Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Governor Rick Perry's stance on immigration. The user mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author used, and they've listed specific morally framed words: detain, deport, immigration, policy, crimes, does, cooperating, force, cooperate. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Perry is supporting a federal policy to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. He's contrasting this with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which he criticizes as allowing nonviolent immigrants to be released. He's trying to shore up his credentials on immigration, especially since he's polling low in New Hampshire. He got an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who's known for tough immigration policies but is also controversial.

I need to make sure the summary includes the morally charged words. So, I'll mention Perry's support for detaining and deporting, the contrast with Obama's policy, and the endorsement from Arpaio. I should also touch on the criticism of his previous stance on in-state tuition for some immigrants, his apology, and the polarizing nature of Arpaio.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with Perry's policy, then the contrast, his efforts to win back voters, Arpaio's endorsement, and the mixed reception of Arpaio. I'll make sure to include the moral words without making it too long.

Wait, the user also wants the summary after "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." So I'll format it accordingly. I should avoid any markdown and keep it plain. Let me put it all together, making sure each point is clear and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has called for a federal policy to detain and deport every undocumented immigrant apprehended, contrasting it with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which he deems "horrific." Perry emphasized deporting undocumented individuals after expedited hearings, focusing on those with serious crimes or threats to public safety. He sought to strengthen his immigration credentials, winning an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his tough enforcement policies. However, Perry previously faced criticism for supporting in-state tuition for some children of undocumented immigrants, leading him to apologize for calling opponents "heartless." As the New Hampshire primary approaches, Perry trails Mitt Romney, with immigration ranking low as an issue for voters. Arpaio, while popular in Arizona, is controversial due to lawsuits alleging racial profiling and rights violations. Perry also signaled opposition to federal lawsuits against states for their immigration policies, further aligning himself with a strict enforcement stance. END OF SUMMARY.
