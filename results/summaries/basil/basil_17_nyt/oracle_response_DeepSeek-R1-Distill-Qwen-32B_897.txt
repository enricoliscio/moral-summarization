Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has provided the text and the list of morally framed words. I'll start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

Gov. Rick Perry is supporting a federal policy to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. He's contrasting this with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which he criticizes. He's trying to strengthen his immigration credentials, especially with the New Hampshire primary approaching. He got an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who's a tough figure but also controversial. There's mention of Perry's past support for in-state tuition for some immigrants, which caused criticism. The article also touches on the broader context, like the Justice Department suing Arpaio and the impact of strict immigration laws in Arizona.

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally framed words: detain, deport, immigration, policy, crimes, does, cooperating, force, cooperate. I should structure the summary to highlight Perry's stance, the contrast with Obama, the endorsement, and the criticisms, all while using those terms.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start with Perry's support for the policy, mention the contrast with Obama's approach, his endorsement from Arpaio, the criticism he faced, and the broader implications of immigration policies. I'll make sure each of the moral terms is included where appropriate.

Let me draft the summary step by step. First, introduce Perry's support for detention and deportation. Then, contrast with Obama's policy. Mention the endorsement and its implications. Highlight the criticism over tuition policy. Note the polarizing nature of Arpaio and the legal issues. Conclude with the significance of immigration in the race.

I think that covers all the main points and includes the required moral terms. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within limits and that the summary flows naturally.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has endorsed a federal policy to "detain and deport" every undocumented immigrant apprehended, emphasizing a contrast with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" approach, which he calls "horrific." Perry clarified that his stance does not involve rounding up undocumented immigrants but rather deporting those arrested or detained after an expedited hearing. His comments aim to strengthen his immigration credentials ahead of the New Hampshire primary, where immigration ranks low as a priority for voters. Perry secured an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, a polarizing figure known for his tough immigration enforcement. However, Arpaio faces a Justice Department lawsuit for allegedly violating Hispanic rights, which he denies. Perry also apologized for his controversial support of in-state tuition for some undocumented students, calling his earlier remarks "inappropriate." Despite his efforts, Perry trails Mitt Romney in polls, and immigration remains a contentious issue, with some states like Arizona seeing backlash against strict policies. Perry has signaled he would not support federal lawsuits against states for their immigration decisions. END OF SUMMARY.
