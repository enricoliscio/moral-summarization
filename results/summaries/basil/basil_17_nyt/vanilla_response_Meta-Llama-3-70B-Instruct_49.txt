SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has stated that he would support a federal policy to detain and deport all illegal immigrants who are apprehended. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which allows some nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the public. Perry's stance is in contrast to his previous support for a state plan that provides in-state college tuition to children of illegal immigrants. He has apologized for calling opponents of the plan "heartless". Perry has received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his tough stance on immigration. However, Arpaio is a polarizing figure and his endorsement may not help Perry in New Hampshire, where immigration is not a top concern for voters. Perry trails behind Mitt Romney in the polls.

END OF SUMMARY.
