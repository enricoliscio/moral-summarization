SUMMARY:
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has made a strong statement on illegal immigration, advocating for a federal policy to detain and deport all undocumented immigrants apprehended. This is an attempt to bolster his credentials on immigration and appeal to Republican primary voters. He has received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, known for his tough stance on immigration. However, Perry has faced criticism within his own party for his support of a state plan offering lower-cost in-state college tuition to some children of illegal immigrants. He has since apologized for calling those who opposed his position "heartless." Perry's stance on immigration is in contrast to the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which he deems horrific. The Texas governor is trying to shore up support in New Hampshire, but it remains to be seen if Arpaio's endorsement will help, as Mitt Romney currently leads the polls there. Additionally, Arpaio is a polarizing figure, facing a lawsuit from the Justice Department for allegedly violating the rights of Hispanics. Despite this, he remains popular in Arizona, though there are signs that the state's aggressive immigration policies may be losing favor, as evidenced by the recent recall of State Sen. Russell Pearce, an ally of Arpaio. Perry has signaled he would not support the Justice Department's lawsuit if elected president. END OF SUMMARY.
