Okay, so I need to help the user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Governor Rick Perry's stance on immigration, his support for deporting undocumented immigrants, and his endorsement by Sheriff Joe Arpaio. 

I notice that the user wants me to identify all the morally framed words first. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "detain," "deport," "illegal," "horrific," "controversial," "toughest," "interdict," "heartless," "apology," "inappropriate," "soft," "polarizing," "intimidate," "racial profiling," "aggressive," "defeated," "recall," "controversial," "suing," and "citizens." These words are key because they reflect judgments or values.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include these moral terms. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Perry's policy, then mention his endorsement by Arpaio, the criticism he faced, his apology, and the mixed reception in New Hampshire. I'll also touch on Arpaio's controversial status and the legal issues surrounding immigration policies in Arizona.

I have to ensure that the summary flows naturally while incorporating the moral language. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Finally, I'll format it as per the user's instructions, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I think I've covered all the necessary points and included the morally framed words effectively. Let me put it all together now.

**STEP 1:**  
* Detain  
* Deport

* Controversial  
* Toughest  
* Interdict  
* Heartless  
* Apology  
* Inappropriate  
* Soft  
* Polarizing  
* Intimidate

* Citizens  

**SUMMARY:**  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas announced support for a federal policy to detain and deport undocumented immigrants after an expedited hearing, contrasting it with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which he called "horrific." Perry sought to strengthen his immigration credentials, winning an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a polarizing figure known for his tough enforcement tactics. However, Perry faced criticism within his party for backing in-state tuition for children of undocumented immigrants, leading him to apologize for calling opponents "heartless." Despite Arpaio's endorsement, Perry trails Mitt Romney in New Hampshire, where immigration is a low-priority issue for voters. Arpaio, who has faced legal challenges for allegedly violating Hispanic rights, remains controversial. Meanwhile, Perry opposes federal lawsuits against states for their immigration policies, signaling a potential shift in federal-state relations. END OF SUMMARY.
