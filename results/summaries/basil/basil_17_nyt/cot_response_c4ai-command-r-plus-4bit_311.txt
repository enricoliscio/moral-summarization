SUMMARY: 
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has taken a hard line on immigration, stating he would support a federal policy to detain and deport every illegal alien apprehended. Perry, seeking to differentiate himself from the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, has faced criticism within his party for his stance on immigration. He has been endorsed by Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, who is known for his tough stance on illegal immigration and has been criticized for allegedly violating the rights of Hispanics. Perry has apologized for previously calling those who opposed his position "heartless." He has also signaled that he disagrees with the Justice Department's lawsuit against Arpaio for his aggressive immigration policies, stating that the federal government should not sue states for making decisions in the best interests of their citizens. Despite his efforts to shore up his credentials on immigration, Perry trails Mitt Romney in the polls in New Hampshire, where immigration is not a top issue for most Republican voters. Additionally, Arpaio's polarizing tactics, including forcing inmates to wear pink underwear and housing them in tents, may not be a winning strategy, as evidenced by the recent recall of Arizona State Sen. Russell Pearce, an ally of Arpaio who pushed through a controversial immigration law.
END OF SUMMARY.
