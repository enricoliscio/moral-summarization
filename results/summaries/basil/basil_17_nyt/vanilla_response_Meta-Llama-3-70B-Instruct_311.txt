SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has stated that he would support a federal policy to detain and deport every illegal immigrant apprehended, with an expedited hearing. This policy is in contrast to the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which allows nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the public. Perry's stance is an attempt to shore up his credentials on immigration, particularly after being criticized for supporting a state plan that gives in-state college tuition to children of illegal immigrants. Perry has received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his tough stance on immigration. However, Arpaio is a polarizing figure, and his endorsement may not significantly help Perry in New Hampshire, where immigration is not a top priority for voters. Perry has also signaled that he would not support the continuation of a lawsuit against Arizona's controversial immigration law if elected president.

END OF SUMMARY.
