SUMMARY: Texas Governor Rick Perry has taken a hard line on illegal immigration, stating that he would support a policy to detain and deport every apprehended illegal alien. Perry's comments come as he attempts to shore up his credentials on immigration ahead of the New Hampshire primary, where he is currently polling far behind Mitt Romney. Perry received an endorsement from controversial Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration. Arpaio praised Perry's efforts to send law enforcement to the Texas-Mexico border. However, Perry has faced criticism within his own party for backing a state plan that gives lower-cost in-state college tuition to some children of illegal immigrants. Perry has apologized for his previous comments calling those who opposed his position heartless. While immigration may not be a top issue for likely Republican voters in New Hampshire, Perry is trying to win back support from primary voters who abandoned him due to his perceived soft stance on illegal immigration. END OF SUMMARY.
