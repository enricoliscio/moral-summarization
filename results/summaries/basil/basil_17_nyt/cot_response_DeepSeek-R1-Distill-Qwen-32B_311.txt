Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Governor Rick Perry's immigration stance. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words in the article. Then, I have to write a summary that includes as many of those moral words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to find the morally charged words. Words like "detain," "deport," "illegal," "horrific," "controversial," "toughest," "endorsement," "credentials," "resources," "criminals," "public safety," "national interest," "heartless," "apology," "inappropriate," "polarizing," "intimidate," "racial profiling," "moderate," "controversial," "suing," "citizens." I'll list these out.

Next, I need to craft a concise summary that includes these words. I'll start by mentioning Perry's support for detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants, contrasting it with Obama's policies. I'll note his endorsement from Sheriff Arpaio, the criticism he faced, and his apology. I'll also include the polarizing nature of Arpaio and the legal issues involved. I'll make sure to keep the summary under 200 words and include the morally framed words where appropriate.

I should check that the summary flows well and accurately represents the article's content, highlighting the moral aspects without adding personal opinions. I'll also ensure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

**SUMMARY:**

Gov. Rick Perry of Texas supports a federal policy to detain and deport undocumented immigrants, criticizing the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy as horrific. He seeks to focus resources on deporting those who threaten public safety or national interest. Perry, endorsed by Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a controversial figure, aims to strengthen his immigration credentials. However, Perry faced criticism for backing in-state tuition for children of undocumented immigrants, calling opponents heartless, for which he later apologized. Arpaio, known for polarizing views and legal issues, including a Justice Department lawsuit alleging racial profiling, supports Perry's border enforcement efforts. Despite Arpaio's popularity, some in Arizona oppose aggressive immigration policies. Perry also opposes federal lawsuits against states for immigration decisions, highlighting his stance on immigration enforcement. END OF SUMMARY.
