SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas addressed his stance on illegal immigration, stating that he supports detaining and deporting every illegal alien apprehended, with expedited hearings. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy and received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, known for his tough stance on immigration. Perry has faced criticism within his party for his support of in-state college tuition for some children of illegal immigrants and has since apologized for his comments. He reiterated his apology while trying to regain support from Republican primary voters. However, the endorsement from Sheriff Arpaio, a polarizing figure facing a lawsuit from the Justice Department for alleged violation of Hispanics' rights, may not significantly boost Perry's campaign in New Hampshire, where immigration is a lower priority issue for voters. Perry also signaled his opposition to the federal government's lawsuit against Arizona's aggressive immigration policies. END OF SUMMARY.
