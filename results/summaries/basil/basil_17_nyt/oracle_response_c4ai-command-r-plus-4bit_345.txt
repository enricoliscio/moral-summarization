SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas proposed a federal policy that would "detain and deport every illegal alien" apprehended, a sharp contrast to the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy. This statement comes as Perry tries to shore up his credentials on immigration and win back Republican primary voters who see him as too soft on the issue. He was endorsed by Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, known for his tough stance on immigration, but was also criticized for backing a state plan that gives lower-cost in-state college tuition to some children of illegal immigrants. Perry's proposal has moral implications, as it involves the detention and deportation of individuals, and his contrast with the Obama administration's policy, which allows nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released, raises questions about the ethical treatment of those detained. The article also mentions the potential violation of rights of Hispanics by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department and the controversial Arizona law that would turn police officers into immigration agents, which the Justice Department is fighting. Perry signaled he would not support the Justice Department's lawsuit if elected president, suggesting a different approach to immigration policy and the rights of states.

END OF SUMMARY.
