SUMMARY: Governor Rick Perry of Texas outlined his plans to detain and deport every undocumented immigrant apprehended, including those arrested or detained for nonviolent crimes. This hardline stance is an attempt to shore up his credentials on immigration and differentiate himself from the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy. He received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, known for his tough stance on immigration, but has also faced criticism for his support of a state plan offering in-state college tuition to some children of illegal immigrants. Perry apologized for previous comments suggesting that those who opposed his position were heartless. He also stated that he would not support the Justice Department's lawsuit against Arpaio for allegedly violating the rights of Hispanics if he were elected president. The endorsement from Arpaio, a polarizing figure, may not significantly help Perry in New Hampshire, where immigration is not a top issue for most Republican voters.

END OF SUMMARY.
