Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Governor Rick Perry's stance on immigration. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the article starts by quoting Perry's support for detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants. He's contrasting this with the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which he calls horrific. His campaign is trying to strengthen his position on immigration, especially with the New Hampshire primary approaching. He got an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for tough immigration policies, but Arpaio is also controversial because of the Justice Department lawsuit against him for possibly violating Hispanic rights.

Perry has faced criticism within his party for supporting in-state tuition for children of undocumented immigrants. He apologized for calling opponents heartless, trying to win back voters who think he's too soft on immigration. However, in New Hampshire, immigration isn't a top issue, and Perry is trailing Romney. The article also mentions Arizona's experience with strict immigration laws and how even an ally of Arpaio, Senator Pearce, was defeated in a recall election, showing some backlash against such policies.

I need to make sure the summary includes Perry's policy stance, his contrast with Obama, the endorsement from Arpaio, the criticism he faced, his apology, the context of the upcoming primary, Arpaio's controversial status, and the broader implications of strict immigration policies in Arizona.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral aspects, like the criticism of the Obama policy as horrific, the focus on deporting serious criminals versus others, and the controversial nature of Arpaio's methods. I also need to mention the legal challenges and the mixed reception of such policies.

Let me structure this step by step: start with Perry's announcement, his contrast with Obama, mention the endorsement by Arpaio, touch on Perry's past criticism and apology, the primary context, Arpaio's controversy, and the broader impact in Arizona. Make sure each point is clear and the moral framing is preserved.

I think that covers all the necessary points without going over the word limit. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY:  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has endorsed a federal policy to detain and deport undocumented immigrants upon apprehension, criticizing the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy as "horrific." Perry emphasized focusing on deporting those with serious criminal records or public safety threats, while distancing himself from rounding up undocumented individuals. His comments came as he seeks to strengthen his immigration credentials ahead of the New Hampshire primary, after criticism for supporting in-state tuition for children of undocumented immigrants. Perry apologized for previously calling opponents "heartless" but remains polarizing. He secured an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for tough immigration enforcement, though Arpaio faces a Justice Department lawsuit over allegations of rights violations. Arpaio's controversial methods, including detaining immigrants in tents, have drawn both support and backlash. Meanwhile, Perry opposes federal lawsuits against states for their immigration policies, reflecting a broader debate over state vs. federal authority. END OF SUMMARY.
