SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, calling for a federal policy to "detain and deport every illegal alien that we apprehend." Perry criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, labeling it "horrific." Instead, he advocates for expedited hearings to deport undocumented individuals arrested or detained. Perry's stance has earned him an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his aggressive immigration policies. However, Perry's views on immigration have been controversial, particularly his support for in-state college tuition for children of illegal immigrants. He has since apologized for calling opponents of this policy "heartless." Perry's stance on immigration is seen as an attempt to shore up his credentials on the issue, but it remains to be seen how much it will help him in the New Hampshire primary. END OF SUMMARY.
