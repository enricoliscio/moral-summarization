SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has vowed to detain and deport every illegal immigrant apprehended, a stance that has drawn criticism and praise from various factions. Perry's comments come as he tries to shore up his credentials on immigration, having previously been criticized by his own party for backing a state plan that offers in-state college tuition to some children of illegal immigrants. Backers of Perry's stance argue that it allows resources to be focused on deporting illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes. Meanwhile, a controversial figure, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, has endorsed Perry's efforts to interdict illegal crossings, sending law enforcement to the Texas-Mexico border. However, Perry's hardline approach may not help him in New Hampshire, where rival Mitt Romney leads in the polls and immigration is a lower priority issue for voters. Additionally, Perry's stance has drawn legal challenges from the Justice Department, which has sued to prevent a similar immigration policy in Arizona from taking effect.
END OF SUMMARY.
