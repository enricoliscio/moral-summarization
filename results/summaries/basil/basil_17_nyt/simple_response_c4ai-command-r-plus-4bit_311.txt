SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said he would support a federal policy to detain and deport every apprehended undocumented immigrant, a move that would be a drastic shift from current policies. He differentiated himself from the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which allows nonviolent undocumented immigrants to be released back into society. This stance comes as Perry attempts to bolster his credentials on immigration, having previously faced criticism within his party for his support of a state plan offering lower-cost in-state college tuition to some children of undocumented immigrants. He received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, known for his tough stance on immigration, but it remains to be seen how this will impact his polling, especially in light of Arpaio's polarizing reputation. Perry's comments and Arpaio's endorsement highlight the moral debate surrounding immigration enforcement in the United States, with some seeing the current policies as too lenient and others arguing for a more humane approach.

END OF SUMMARY.
