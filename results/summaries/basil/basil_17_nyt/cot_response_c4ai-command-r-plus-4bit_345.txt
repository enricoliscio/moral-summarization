SUMMARY:
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has taken a hard line on illegal immigration, stating that he supports a federal policy to "detain and deport every illegal alien that we apprehend." While an aide clarified that this does not suggest rounding up illegal immigrants, Perry's stance calls for the expedited expulsion of those found to be undocumented after being arrested or detained. Perry's comments come as he attempts to bolster his credentials on immigration and distance himself from past criticisms within his own party. He has apologized for previously suggesting that those who opposed his position on offering lower-cost in-state college tuition to some children of illegal immigrants were heartless. 

Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, known for his tough stance on illegal immigration, endorsed Perry, praising his efforts to interdict illegal crossings at the Texas-Mexico border. However, Perry's stance on immigration has not been without controversy. He has been criticized by some within his party and is currently polling behind Mitt Romney in New Hampshire, where immigration is not a top issue for most Republican voters. Additionally, the endorsement from Arpaio, a polarizing figure himself, may not provide much benefit, as evidenced by the recent defeat of Arpaio's ally, Arizona State Sen. Russell Pearce, in a recall election. Arpaio has also faced accusations of violating the rights of Hispanics and engaging in racial profiling, which he denies.
