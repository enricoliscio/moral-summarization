SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, seeking to shore up his credentials on immigration, said he would support a federal policy to detain and deport every undocumented immigrant apprehended in the country. This stance was reinforced by his endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, known for his tough stance on immigration. Perry's comments come after criticism from within his own party for backing a state plan that provides in-state college tuition for some children of illegal immigrants. He has since apologized for his previous comments calling those who opposed his position heartless. Perry's hard-line approach on immigration is in contrast to the Obama administration's policy, which allows nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the general public. However, his stance on immigration may not be enough to boost his poll numbers in New Hampshire, where rival Mitt Romney leads. Additionally, Sheriff Arpaio is a polarizing figure, currently being sued by the Justice Department for allegedly violating the rights of Hispanics. Perry has stated that he would not support the continuation of this lawsuit if elected president. END OF SUMMARY.
