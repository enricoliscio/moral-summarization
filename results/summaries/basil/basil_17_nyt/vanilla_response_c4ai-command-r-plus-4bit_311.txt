SUMMARY: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has stated that he would support a federal policy to detain and deport all illegal aliens apprehended in the country. This statement comes as Perry attempts to shore up his credentials on immigration, having previously been criticized by his own party for backing a state plan that provides in-state college tuition for some children of illegal immigrants. Perry received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, known for his tough stance on immigration, but it is unclear how much this will help Perry in the New Hampshire primary, where he is currently polling far behind Mitt Romney. Perry has also signaled that he would not support a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against Arpaio for allegedly violating the rights of Hispanics. Critics argue that the state's aggressive immigration policies, such as those supported by Arpaio, may be turning off some voters, as seen in the recent recall election of Arizona State Sen. Russell Pearce, a longtime ally of Arpaio.
