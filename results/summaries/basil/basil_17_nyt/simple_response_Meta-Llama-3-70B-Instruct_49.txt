SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has taken a hardline stance on illegal immigration, calling for the detention and deportation of all undocumented immigrants apprehended by authorities. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, which allows some nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the public. Perry's stance has earned him an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance on immigration. However, Perry's position has also drawn criticism, including from within his own party, for being too harsh. His previous support for a state plan giving in-state college tuition to children of illegal immigrants was seen as too soft. Perry has since apologized for calling opponents of the plan "heartless." The endorsement from Arpaio, who has been accused of racial profiling, may not help Perry in New Hampshire, where immigration is not a top concern for voters.

END OF SUMMARY.
