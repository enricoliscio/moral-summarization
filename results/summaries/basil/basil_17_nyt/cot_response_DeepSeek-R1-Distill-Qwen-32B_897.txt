Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Governor Rick Perry and his stance on immigration. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed words and then write a summary preserving those moral terms. 

Starting with STEP 1, I should go through the article and pick out words that have a moral connotation. Words like "detain," "deport," "illegal," "horrific," "controversial," "toughest," "interdict," "heartless," "apology," "inappropriate," "soft," "polarizing," "intimidate," "racial profiling," "aggressive," "recall," "moderate," "controversial," "suing." These words carry moral judgments or implications about the actions or policies discussed.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article while keeping these moral terms. The article talks about Perry's tough immigration policies, his support for deporting undocumented immigrants, his criticism of Obama's policies, and his endorsement by Sheriff Arpaio. It also mentions the criticism he faced for supporting in-state tuition for some immigrants and his apology. The summary should include these points, highlighting the moral framing words.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key points: Perry's policy, his criticism of Obama, Arpaio's endorsement, his past criticism, the lawsuit against Arpaio, and the impact of tough immigration laws in Arizona.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Perry's announcement, his stance, the endorsement, his past issues, and the broader implications of such policies. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to preserve the author's framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has called for a federal policy to detain and deport every undocumented immigrant apprehended, criticizing the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy as "horrific." Perry emphasized focusing on deporting those convicted of serious crimes or posing public safety threats. He won an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, known for his controversial immigration enforcement tactics. However, Perry previously faced criticism for supporting in-state tuition for some children of undocumented immigrants, calling opponents "heartless" before apologizing. With the New Hampshire primary approaching, Perry's immigration stance remains a polarizing issue, as Arpaio's endorsement may not sway voters in a state where immigration ranks low as a priority. Arpaio, a divisive figure, is facing a Justice Department lawsuit for allegedly violating Hispanic rights. Meanwhile, Perry opposes federal lawsuits against states for their immigration policies, signaling a potential shift in federal-state relations if elected. END OF SUMMARY.
