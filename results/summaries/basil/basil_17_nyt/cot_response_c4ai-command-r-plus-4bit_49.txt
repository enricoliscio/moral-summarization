SUMMARY:
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has taken a hard line on immigration, stating his support for a federal policy to "detain and deport every illegal alien." Perry's comments come as he attempts to shore up his credentials on immigration and win back Republican primary voters who see him as too soft on the issue. He has been endorsed by Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, known for his tough stance on immigration and controversial policies. However, Perry has also faced criticism for backing a state plan that gives children of illegal immigrants in-state college tuition, calling those who opposed him "heartless." Perry later apologized for this comment, calling it "inappropriate." Meanwhile, Arpaio, who has been accused of systematically violating the rights of Hispanics and engaging in racial profiling by the Justice Department, is a polarizing figure himself. Despite his popularity in Arizona, some see the state's aggressive immigration policies as inhumane and inappropriate. Earlier this month, an ally of Arpaio was defeated in a recall election due to his support for a controversial law that would turn police officers into de facto immigration agents. Perry has stated his opposition to the Justice Department's lawsuit against Arizona over this law, saying the federal government should not interfere with state decisions.
END OF SUMMARY.
