SUMMARY:
Texas Governor Rick Perry has taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, calling for the detention and deportation of every undocumented immigrant apprehended. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy as "horrific" and vowed to focus resources on deporting illegal immigrants who pose a threat to public safety or national interest. Perry's stance has earned him an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough and controversial approach to immigration. However, Perry has also faced criticism for his support of a state plan that provides in-state college tuition to children of illegal immigrants, which some have deemed "heartless" to oppose. Perry apologized for his previous comments, calling them "inappropriate." Despite the polarizing nature of the issue, Perry is trying to shore up his credentials on immigration ahead of the New Hampshire primary. END OF SUMMARY.
