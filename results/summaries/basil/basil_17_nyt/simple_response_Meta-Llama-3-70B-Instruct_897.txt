SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Rick Perry has taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, vowing to detain and deport every undocumented immigrant apprehended. He criticized the Obama administration's "catch-and-release" policy, calling it "horrific." Perry's plan would expedite hearings for those found to be undocumented and deport them, focusing resources on serious criminals and threats to public safety. His stance has drawn criticism from within his own party, particularly for supporting in-state college tuition for children of illegal immigrants. Perry has apologized for calling opponents of this plan "heartless." He has received an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough immigration policies, but Arpaio's controversial reputation may not help Perry in New Hampshire, where immigration is not a top issue for voters.

END OF SUMMARY.
