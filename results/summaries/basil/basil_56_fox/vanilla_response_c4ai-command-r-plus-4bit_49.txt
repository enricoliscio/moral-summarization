SUMMARY: In his first major foreign policy speech since launching his presidential campaign, Sen. Marco Rubio outlined a hawkish and interventionist approach to global affairs, prioritizing a strong U.S. military presence and taking an aggressive stance against nations that undermine global commerce. Rubio criticized the Obama administration for its cautious approach to foreign crises and its willingness to engage with hostile governments. He emphasized the need for the U.S. to be a world moral leader and pledged to restore American strength by adequately funding the military. Rubio also took aim at Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, criticizing her role in the current administration's foreign policy decisions. He expressed opposition to diplomatic relations with Cuba and argued for a tough stance on Iran, stating that they cannot be trusted in nuclear negotiations. The Democratic National Committee dismissed Rubio's speech as "neoconservative meets Cold War." Rubio's foreign policy agenda reflects his experience on Senate committees and his access to sensitive information. He defended his positions during a question-and-answer session with Charlie Rose.
END OF SUMMARY.
