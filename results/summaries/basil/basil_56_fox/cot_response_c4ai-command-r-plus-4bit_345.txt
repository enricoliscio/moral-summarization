SUMMARY: In his first major foreign policy speech, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio outlined a hawkish and morally-charged approach, emphasizing the need for a strong military and decisive action against nations that undermine global commerce. Rubio criticized the Obama administration for its "disregard for our moral purpose" and accused the president of being too cautious in the face of global crises. He pledged to prioritize military funding and take aggressive steps to confront nations like China, Iran, and Russia that threaten global commerce and U.S. economic interests. Rubio also criticized Obama for "embracing regimes that systematically opposed our principles" and for a foreign policy that demonstrated "disdain" and "disregard for moral purpose." He defended his stance on maintaining the embargo on Cuba, arguing that it is not to blame for Cuba's economic failures, and expressed distrust of Iran in the ongoing nuclear negotiations. Rubio's speech framed his foreign policy vision around the notion that "the world is at its safest when America is at its strongest," emphasizing military might and strength as the path to peace and global stability.
