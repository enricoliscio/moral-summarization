Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article says Rubio gave his first major foreign policy speech since starting his presidential campaign. He's a Florida Republican. He talked about prioritizing a strong military, taking aggressive steps against nations that harm global commerce, and making the U.S. a moral leader. He criticized Obama's administration for being too cautious, leading to the U.S. losing its global influence. Rubio mentioned that threats have changed since the Cold War but the need for American strength hasn't, it's even more important now because the world is more connected.

He emphasized funding the military as his top priority, even in peaceful times. He criticized Obama for being too eager to please other nations, like with Russia, Iran, and Cuba. Rubio said Obama's approach disrespected American values and principles. He also talked about decisive action against countries like China and Iran when they undermine U.S. economic interests. The DNC responded, calling his policies outdated and hawkish. Rubio's stance is seen as more conservative than some Republicans, opposing military spending cuts and favoring a tough line on Cuba and Iran.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Rubio's main priorities, his criticism of Obama, key points about military funding, his stance on Cuba and Iran, the DNC's response, and his overall approach as hawkish. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the speech, his priorities, criticisms, specific examples, the DNC's reaction, and his reputation for being hawkish.

Wait, I should also mention that Rubio wants the U.S. to be a moral leader and that he believes a strong military leads to more peace. Also, his comments on the embargo against Cuba and why it's necessary. Maybe include that he's more hawkish than some in his party, like on Cuba and Iran.

Let me make sure I cover all key points without going over the word limit. I'll start with the main points: Rubio's speech, priorities, criticism of Obama, military funding, opposition to regimes like Cuba and Iran, DNC's criticism, and his hawkish reputation.

I think that's a solid outline. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure it's concise and within the word limit.
