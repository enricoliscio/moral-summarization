SUMMARY:

Senator Marco Rubio delivered a foreign policy speech, emphasizing the need for a strong US military and moral leadership. He criticized the Obama administration's cautious approach, saying it has led to a decline in US global influence. Rubio vowed to prioritize military funding and take aggressive action against nations that undermine global commerce, such as China and Iran. He also blasted Obama's "disregard for our moral purpose" and his willingness to acquiesce to foreign governments that oppose US values. Rubio's stance is seen as hawkish, and he has taken tougher positions on foreign policy than some of his Republican colleagues. He defended his opposition to diplomatic relations with Cuba and Iran, citing their human rights abuses and untrustworthiness. Rubio believes that a strong America is essential for global peace and stability, and that the US must take a leading role in promoting its values and interests.
