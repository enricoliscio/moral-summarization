Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. They mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, the user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so they probably want a concise summary that highlights the key moral points Rubio made.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Rubio talked about restoring American strength, funding the military, and being a world moral leader. He criticized Obama for being too cautious and not standing up against nations like Iran and Cuba. He also mentioned the need to counter China and Russia economically.

I should note the moral elements, like Rubio's emphasis on the US as a moral leader and his criticism of Obama for not upholding American principles. Also, his stance on Cuba and Iran, like maintaining the embargo and not trusting Iran's nuclear program, are part of the moral framing.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes these points. I'll structure it to first introduce Rubio's priorities, then his criticism of Obama, and finally touch on specific policies regarding Cuba and Iran. I should keep the language clear and concise, ensuring the moral aspects are highlighted as per the user's request.
