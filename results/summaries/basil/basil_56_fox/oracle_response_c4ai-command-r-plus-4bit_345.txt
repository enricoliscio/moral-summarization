SUMMARY: In his first major foreign policy speech since launching his presidential campaign, Senator Marco Rubio outlined a strong moral vision for U.S. global leadership. He criticized the Obama administration for its cautious response to overseas crises, arguing that American strength and moral purpose are essential for maintaining world peace. Rubio emphasized the need to prioritize military funding and take aggressive action against nations like China and Iran that undermine global commerce. He characterized Obama as acquiescing to hostile foreign governments and disregarding America's moral leadership, even "flirting with disdain" for American values. Rubio also defended his stance on Cuba, arguing that the U.S. should not engage with a regime that stole property from its citizens and systematically opposes U.S. principles. He criticized Obama's approach to Iran, stating that the country cannot be trusted to uphold its commitments once sanctions are lifted. Rubio's foreign policy agenda, often hawkish, reflects his experience on Senate committees and his belief in American moral exceptionalism.
