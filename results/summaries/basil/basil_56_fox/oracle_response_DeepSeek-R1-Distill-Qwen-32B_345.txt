Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rubio is criticizing Obama's foreign policy, emphasizing the need for a strong military, moral leadership, and taking aggressive steps against nations that threaten global commerce. He uses terms like "crises," "threats," "restore," "fund," "disregard," "disdain," "embrace," "undermine," "block," "response," and "disaster."

I should structure the summary to highlight Rubio's key arguments. Start by mentioning his speech and the main priorities: military strength, global commerce, and moral leadership. Then, contrast his views with Obama's policies, using terms like "disregard," "flirted with disdain," and "reset." Include his criticism of Obama's approach towards Iran, Russia, and Cuba, using "embrace" and "undermine."

Next, touch on Rubio's stance against China and Iran, using "block" and "response." Mention the DNC's criticism and Rubio's tougher stance compared to other Republicans, using "hawkish" and "stuck." Finally, address his comments on Cuba and Iran, using "embargo," "stolen," "failed," and "secret component."

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, covers all key points, and includes the morally charged words. I'll keep each sentence concise and focused on the main ideas without going into too much detail. After drafting, I'll check the word count and adjust as necessary to stay within 200 words.

Now, I'll start drafting the summary, making sure to incorporate the moral framing words and maintain a clear, concise structure.

SUMMARY:  
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, in his first major foreign policy speech since launching his presidential campaign, emphasized restoring American strength and moral leadership. He criticized the Obama administration for being overly cautious in addressing global crises, leading to a decline in U.S. military and moral influence. Rubio argued that the world is more interconnected, requiring forethought and investment in military capabilities to respond decisively to threats. He accused Obama of disregarding America's moral purpose, flirting with disdain for its role as a global leader, and embracing regimes like Russia, Iran, and Cuba that undermine U.S. principles. Rubio vowed to take aggressive steps against nations that block global commerce, such as China and Iran, and to fund the military even in times of peace. He also criticized Obama's "reset" policies and the DNC labeled his approach as "neoconservative meets Cold War." Rubio defended his hawkish stance, including keeping Guantanamo Bay open and maintaining the Cuba embargo, while opposing diplomatic openings with Iran. He stressed the need for American might to ensure peace, criticizing Obama's reliance on diplomacy over decisive action. END OF SUMMARY.
