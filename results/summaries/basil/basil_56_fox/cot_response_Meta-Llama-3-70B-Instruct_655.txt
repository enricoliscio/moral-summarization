SUMMARY:
U.S. Senator Marco Rubio delivered a foreign policy speech, emphasizing the need for a strong military and a morally strong America to counter nations that undermine global commerce. He criticized President Obama's "disregard for our moral purpose" and "audacity to dictate our terms" to other nations. Rubio accused Obama of being overly cautious and "eager to acquiesce" to foreign governments that have "thumbed their noses" at the U.S. and international laws. He vowed to take aggressive steps against nations like China and Iran that attempt to undermine global commerce. Rubio's foreign policy agenda is often hawkish, prioritizing a strong military and moral leadership. He believes that "the world is at its safest when America is at its strongest." END OF SUMMARY.
