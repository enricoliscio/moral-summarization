SUMMARY:

In a major foreign policy speech, Senator Marco Rubio emphasized the need for a strong military and aggressive steps to combat nations that undermine global commerce, ensuring the US remains a world moral leader. Rubio criticized the Obama administration's cautious responses to crises overseas, saying it has led to the US losing its place as a world military and moral power. He vowed to prioritize funding the military, even in times of peace and stability, to restore American strength. Rubio also accused Obama of demonstrating a disregard for the US's moral purpose, embracing regimes that systematically oppose American principles, and being unwilling to take decisive action against aggressive nations like China and Iran. The Democratic National Committee responded by labeling Rubio's approach as "neoconservative" and "stuck in the Cold War." Rubio's hawkish foreign policy agenda has been a hallmark of his service in the Senate and now in his campaign.
