Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech, and they want a concise summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rubio is criticizing Obama's foreign policy, emphasizing the need for a strong military, and positioning himself as a moral leader. He's against soft approaches and wants to take aggressive steps against nations that threaten global commerce.

Next, I'll identify the morally framed words the author used. These include words like "crises," "war," "threats," "forethought," "design," "build," "restore," "fund," "thumbed," "disregard," "flirted," "disdain," "criticized," "reset," "hand," "opening," "embraced," "undermine," "block," "response," "stuck," "start," "open," "plan," "meets," "wasted," "stripping," "policy," "disaster," "elect," "ineffective," "negligent," "hostile," "continue," "exercise," "oppression," "mightiest," "peace," "stolen," "failed," "lifted."

Now, I need to craft a summary that includes these words where appropriate. I'll focus on the key points: Rubio's priorities, his criticism of Obama, the need for military strength, and his stance on specific countries like Cuba and Iran.

I'll start by stating Rubio's main points: prioritizing a strong military, fighting nations that undermine global commerce, and being a world moral leader. I'll mention the criticism of Obama's cautious approach, leading to a loss of US influence. Then, I'll include Rubio's specific criticisms about Obama's policies towards Russia, Iran, and Cuba, using words like "reset," "opening," "embraced," and "disregard."

I'll also highlight Rubio's stance on China and Iran, using terms like "undermine," "block," and "response." I'll mention the DNC's criticism, using "stuck" and "plan." Finally, I'll touch on Rubio's tough stance on Cuba and Iran, including the embargo and nuclear talks, using words like "stolen," "failed," and "lifted."

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral framing. I'll structure it to cover Rubio's priorities, criticism of Obama, specific policies, and the DNC's response, all while using the specified words.

SUMMARY: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio emphasized the need for a strong military, aggressive action against nations undermining global commerce, and restoring America's role as a world moral leader in his foreign policy speech. He criticized the Obama administration for overly cautious responses to crises, leading to a decline in U.S. influence. Rubio argued that American strength is essential in an interconnected world, requiring forethought and investment in military capabilities. He accused Obama of disregarding the nation's moral purpose and embracing regimes opposed to U.S. principles, such as Russia, Iran, and Cuba. Rubio vowed to respond decisively to threats from China, Iran, and others who block global commerce. He also criticized Obama's Cuba policy, calling it stuck in the Cold War, and defended the embargo, blaming Cuba's failed economy on its own policies, not sanctions. Rubio dismissed the DNC's characterization of his doctrine as "neoconservative meets Cold War," insisting his approach prioritizes peace through strength. He emphasized the need to fund the military, restore American might, and oppose regimes that exercise oppression. END OF SUMMARY.
