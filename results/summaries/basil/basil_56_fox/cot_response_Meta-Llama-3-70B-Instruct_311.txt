SUMMARY:
U.S. Senator Marco Rubio delivered a foreign policy speech, emphasizing the need for a strong military and aggressive steps to fight nations that undermine global commerce. He criticized the Obama administration's "overly cautious" responses to crises overseas, accusing the President of being "concerned with softening any perception other nations has of the United States as a bully." Rubio argued that the U.S. has lost its place as a world military and moral power, and vowed to restore American strength by adequately funding the military. He also pledged to take decisive action against aggressive nations like China and Iran that attempt to undermine global commerce. Rubio's speech was marked by a hawkish tone, with a focus on promoting American "moral purpose" and upholding "principles" of democracy and freedom. END OF SUMMARY.
