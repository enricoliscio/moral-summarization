SUMMARY:
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio delivered his first major foreign policy speech, emphasizing the need for a strong military and a strong moral leader. He criticized the Obama administration's cautious responses to crises, depicting them as a "disregard for our moral purpose" that has led to a loss of American strength. Rubio vowed to prioritize a strong military, take aggressive steps to fight nations that undermine global commerce, and ensure the U.S. is a world moral leader. He accused Obama of being overly concerned with softening the perception of the U.S. as a bully, leading to a "negligent" foreign policy. Rubio's hawkish approach has been a hallmark of his service, and he believes that "the world is at its safest when America is at its strongest." END OF SUMMARY.
