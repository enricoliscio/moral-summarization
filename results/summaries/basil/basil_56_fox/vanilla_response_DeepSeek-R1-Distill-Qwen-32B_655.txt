Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Rubio's first major foreign policy speech since he started his presidential campaign. He's emphasizing a strong military, taking aggressive steps against nations that disrupt global commerce, and positioning the U.S. as a moral leader. He criticized Obama's administration for being too cautious, leading to the U.S. losing its global influence.

I should note that Rubio delivered this speech at the Council on Foreign Relations. He mentioned that American strength is crucial and needs to be funded even in peaceful times. He criticized Obama for being too soft, like with Russia, Iran, and Cuba. He wants to take decisive action against countries like China and Iran that threaten U.S. economic interests.

The Democratic National Committee responded, pointing out Rubio's policies as outdated and hawkish. Rubio's approach is more aggressive than some Republicans, like on Cuba and Iran. He believes a strong military leads to peace and criticized Obama's focus on diplomacy over tough actions. He also defended the embargo on Cuba, blaming Cuba's economy on its own issues, not the embargo.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll include Rubio's main points: military funding, criticism of Obama's policies, focus on moral leadership, and his stance on Cuba and Iran. Also, mention the DNC's criticism and his belief that strength brings peace.

Let me structure it: start with Rubio's speech, his priorities, criticism of Obama, examples of his tough stance, DNC's response, and his belief in military strength for peace. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: U.S. Senator Marco Rubio outlined his foreign policy priorities in a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, emphasizing a strong military, aggressive action against nations undermining global commerce, and restoring the U.S. as a world moral leader. He criticized President Obama for overly cautious responses to international crises, arguing that American strength has eroded under the current administration. Rubio stressed the need to fund the military even in peaceful times and criticized Obama's approach to diplomacy, calling it ineffective and acquiescent to adversarial nations like Russia, Iran, and Cuba. He also warned against trusting Iran's nuclear intentions and defended the embargo on Cuba, attributing the island's economic struggles to its own policies rather than sanctions. Rubio's hawkish stance, which includes permanent troop presence in the Middle East and opposition to diplomatic openings with Cuba, drew criticism from the Democratic National Committee, which labeled his approach as outdated and extreme. Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, believes a strong military is key to global peace and opposes diplomacy-focused policies. END OF SUMMARY.
