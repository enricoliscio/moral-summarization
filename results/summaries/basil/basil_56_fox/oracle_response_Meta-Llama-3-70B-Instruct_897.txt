SUMMARY:

In a major foreign policy speech, Senator Marco Rubio emphasized the need for a strong military and aggressive steps to combat nations that undermine global commerce. He criticized the Obama administration's "overly cautious" responses to crises, saying they have led to the US losing its place as a world moral leader. Rubio argued that the US must restore its strength, fund its military, and take decisive action against aggressive nations like China and Iran that attempt to block global commerce. He accused Obama of demonstrating "disregard for our moral purpose" and "flirted with disdain" towards the US, embracing regimes that oppose American principles. Rubio's foreign policy agenda is often hawkish, prioritizing a strong military and taking a tough stance on diplomatic relations with Cuba and Iran. He believes that "the world is at its safest when America is at its strongest," and that a strong US military leads to more peace, not conflict.
