Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

Rubio is a Republican senator running for president. His speech was his first major foreign policy address. He's talking about making the U.S. a strong military power again, taking aggressive steps against nations that mess with global commerce, and being a moral leader. He's criticizing Obama's administration for being too cautious and not standing up for American interests.

He mentions that the world is more interconnected, so American strength is more important now. He wants to fund the military even in peaceful times, which he thinks is necessary. He accuses Obama of being too eager to appease foreign governments, even those that oppose U.S. principles. Examples include Russia, Iran, and Cuba. He says Obama's policies have weakened the U.S. and its moral standing.

Rubio also talks about taking decisive action against countries like China and Iran when they threaten U.S. economic interests. He wants to respond to any nation blocking global commerce. The Democratic response criticizes his approach as outdated and hawkish.

Rubio's record in the Senate is hawkish, and he's against military spending cuts. He believes in a strong military to ensure peace. He also defended the embargo on Cuba, saying it's not the cause of Cuba's economic issues and that other countries don't have embargoes against them. He doesn't trust Iran's nuclear program and thinks sanctions shouldn't be lifted.

I need to capture all these points in a concise summary, keeping the moral framing intact. That means highlighting Rubio's emphasis on the U.S. as a moral leader and his criticism of Obama's policies for undermining that role.

Let me structure this: start with Rubio's speech, his main priorities (military strength, moral leadership), criticism of Obama, specific examples, his stance on Iran and Cuba, and the Democratic response. Keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral aspects are clear.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in every detail but focus on the key moral arguments. Also, include his belief that a strong military leads to peace and his tough stance on Cuba and Iran.

Alright, putting it all together now.

SUMMARY: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican presidential candidate, delivered his first major foreign policy speech, emphasizing a return to American military strength and moral leadership. He criticized the Obama administration for being overly cautious and accused it of weakening the U.S. by appeasing hostile nations like Russia, Iran, and Cuba. Rubio argued that Obama's policies, such as the "reset" with Russia and openness to Iran, eroded U.S. moral purpose and global influence. He vowed to prioritize military funding, take decisive action against nations threatening U.S. economic interests, and oppose regimes that oppose American principles. Rubio also defended the Cuba embargo, attributing Cuba's economic failures to its government, not the embargo. He dismissed Pope Francis's diplomatic efforts with Cuba and expressed distrust in Iran's nuclear intentions. The Democratic National Committee criticized Rubio's approach as outdated and hawkish. Rubio, a hawkish senator, believes a strong military ensures peace and opposes military spending cuts, aligning with a "Neoconservative meets Cold War" doctrine. END OF SUMMARY.
