SUMMARY:

U.S. Senator Marco Rubio delivered his first major foreign policy speech since launching his presidential campaign, emphasizing the need for a strong military and aggressive steps to fight nations that undermine global commerce. Rubio criticized the Obama administration's responses to crises overseas as overly cautious, saying it has led to the U.S. losing its place as a world military and moral power. He vowed to prioritize funding the military and take decisive action against aggressive nations like China and Iran. Rubio also reiterated his opposition to normalizing relations with Cuba and his distrust of Iran's nuclear program. The Democratic National Committee responded, labeling Rubio's foreign policy agenda as "neoconservative" and stuck in the Cold War. Rubio's speech highlighted his hawkish approach to foreign policy, which has been a hallmark of his service in the Senate.
