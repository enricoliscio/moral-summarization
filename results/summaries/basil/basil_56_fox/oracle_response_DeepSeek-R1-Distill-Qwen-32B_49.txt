Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech, where he criticizes Obama's administration for being too cautious and not upholding US strength and moral leadership.

The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, so I need to make sure those are included in the summary. Words like "crises," "threats," "restore," "fund," "disregard," "disdain," "embrace," "undermine," "block," "response," "disaster," "ineffective," "negligent," "hostile," "oppression," "mightiest," "peace," "stolen," "failed," "lifted" are key here.

I should start by identifying the main themes: Rubio's priorities (strong military, aggressive steps against nations undermining commerce, moral leadership), his criticism of Obama's policies, and the reactions from Democrats. I need to condense this into a concise summary without losing the moral nuances.

I'll structure the summary by first stating Rubio's priorities, then his critique of Obama, followed by the Democratic response, and finally touch on his stance on Cuba and Iran. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words where appropriate.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words and end it with the specified tokens. Let me draft this, ensuring each sentence captures the essence and the moral language is preserved.

SUMMARY: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, in his first major foreign policy speech since launching his presidential campaign, emphasized restoring American strength as a world military and moral leader. He criticized the Obama administration for being overly cautious in addressing global crises, arguing that the U.S. has lost its position as a moral and military power. Rubio vowed to prioritize funding the military, even in times of peace, and to take aggressive steps against nations like China and Iran that undermine global commerce. He accused Obama of disregarding America's moral purpose, embracing regimes that oppose U.S. principles, and failing to act decisively. Rubio also criticized Hillary Clinton, calling her foreign policy a disaster, and opposed any discussion of a two-state solution with Iran or lifting sanctions. He defended keeping the embargo on Cuba, claiming it is not responsible for Cuba's failed economy. Rubio's hawkish approach, including permanent troop presence in the Middle East and opposition to diplomatic openings with Cuba, drew criticism from Democrats, who labeled his doctrine as "neoconservative meets Cold War." Rubio argued that a strong U.S. military ensures global peace and opposes any policies that weaken American strength. END OF SUMMARY.
