Senator Marco Rubio delivered a foreign policy speech, emphasizing the need for a strong military and a strong moral leader. He criticized the Obama administration's "overly cautious" responses to crises, saying it has led to a decline in America's moral purpose. Rubio vowed to prioritize a strong military, take aggressive steps to fight nations that undermine global commerce, and ensure the US remains a world moral leader. He accused Obama of being too soft on regimes that oppose American principles, such as Russia, China, and Iran. Rubio also defended his stance on Cuba, saying the embargo is not to blame for the country's failed economy, and that Iran cannot be trusted due to its secret nuclear program. He emphasized that "the world is at its safest when America is at its strongest." END OF SUMMARY.
