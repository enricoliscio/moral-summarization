SUMMARY:

In his first major foreign policy speech, US Senator Marco Rubio emphasized the need for a strong military and aggressive steps to counter nations that undermine global commerce. He criticized the Obama administration's cautious responses to crises, saying it has led to the US losing its place as a world military and moral power. Rubio vowed to prioritize military funding and take a tough stance against aggressive nations like China and Iran. He also repeated his criticism of Obama's approach to Cuba and Iran, saying the US must not acquiesce to foreign governments that defy international laws. The Democratic National Committee responded, labeling Rubio's approach as "neoconservative" and "stuck in the Cold War." Rubio's foreign policy agenda has been a hallmark of his service in the Senate and his presidential campaign.
