SUMMARY:

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio delivered his first major foreign policy speech, emphasizing the need for a strong military and aggressive steps to fight nations that undermine global commerce. He criticized the Obama administration's "overly cautious responses to crises overseas," which he believes have led to the U.S. losing its place as a world military and moral leader. Rubio vowed to prioritize funding the military, even in times of peace and stability, to "restore American strength." He accused Obama of demonstrating "disregard for our moral purpose" and "flirted with disdain" towards foreign governments that have thumbed their noses at the U.S. and international laws. Rubio warned that aggressive nations like China and Iran will face a response from his administration if they attempt to block global commerce. He also criticized Obama's foreign policy, calling it a "disaster" and saying it has been "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst." Rubio emphasized that "the world is at its safest when America is at its strongest."
