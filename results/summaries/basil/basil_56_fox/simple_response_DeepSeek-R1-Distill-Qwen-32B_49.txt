Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

Rubio is talking about the U.S. losing its global standing under Obama. He emphasizes a strong military, taking aggressive steps against nations that harm global commerce, and being a moral leader. He criticizes Obama for being too cautious and not standing up for American principles. Rubio mentions specific examples like the reset with Russia, Iran, and Cuba. He believes Obama erred by being too eager to accommodate foreign governments that oppose U.S. values.

He also talks about funding the military adequately, even in peaceful times, because the world isn't stable. Rubio's approach is hawkish, more so than some Republicans. He's against military spending cuts and prefers a tough stance on countries like China, Iran, and Cuba. He supports the embargo on Cuba and doesn't see the issue with Pope Francis's diplomatic moves. He doesn't trust Iran's nuclear intentions.

The DNC responds by calling his policy outdated and Cold War era, focusing on permanent troops in the Middle East and not addressing key issues like a two-state solution.

So, the summary needs to capture Rubio's main points: restoring military strength, criticizing Obama's policies as weakening the U.S., taking aggressive action against adversaries, moral leadership, and opposition to current diplomatic approaches. Also, include the DNC's criticism.

I should make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like Rubio's emphasis on the U.S. as a moral leader and his criticism of Obama for disregarding that purpose. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.
