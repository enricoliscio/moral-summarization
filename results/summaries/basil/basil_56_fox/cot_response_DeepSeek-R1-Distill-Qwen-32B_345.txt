Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech while preserving the moral framing. They provided specific instructions on how to approach this. 

First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. That means looking for words that carry a strong positive or negative moral connotation. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "strong," "aggressive," "moral," "undermine," "disregard," "disdain," "oppress," "failed," "secret," "untrustworthy," and "secretive." These words are used to convey Rubio's moral stance against certain policies and countries.

Next, I have to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by stating Rubio's main points: prioritizing a strong military, fighting nations that undermine global commerce, and being a world moral leader. I'll contrast his views with Obama's policies, using terms like "disregard" and "disdain." I'll also mention his criticism of Obama's approach, the embargo on Cuba, and the distrust of Iran's nuclear program. I'll end by noting the DNC's criticism of his approach as outdated and hawkish.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and accurately reflects Rubio's moral framing without adding any personal opinions. Keeping it concise and within the word limit is crucial. I'll make sure each sentence captures a key point from the article, using the identified moral terms to maintain the original tone.

**SUMMARY:**  
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, in his first major foreign policy speech, emphasized the need for a strong military, aggressive action against nations undermining global commerce, and restoring the U.S. as a world moral leader. He criticized the Obama administration for being overly cautious and accused it of disregarding America's moral purpose, even flirting with disdain for its principles. Rubio argued that Obama's approach, including resets with Russia and Iran, weakened U.S. strength and moral standing. He vowed to prioritize military funding, respond decisively to threats from China, Iran, and Russia, and maintain the embargo on Cuba, rejecting Pope Francis's diplomatic overtures. Rubio also expressed distrust of Iran's nuclear program, stating it had a secret component. He criticized Hillary Clinton's foreign policy as ineffective and negligent. The Democratic National Committee dismissed Rubio's plan as outdated and hawkish, focusing on permanent troop presence in the Middle East and a Cold War-era Cuba policy. Rubio defended his stance, asserting that American strength fosters global peace.
