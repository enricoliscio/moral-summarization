SUMMARY:

In his first major foreign policy speech, US Senator Marco Rubio emphasized the need for a strong military and aggressive steps to counter nations that undermine global commerce. He criticized the Obama administration's cautious responses to crises, saying it has led to the US losing its place as a world military and moral power. Rubio promised to prioritize military funding and take decisive action against nations like China and Iran that attempt to undermine US economic interests. He also reiterated his opposition to normalizing relations with Cuba and his skepticism towards Iran's nuclear program. Rubio's speech was seen as a hawkish approach to foreign policy, with the Democratic National Committee labeling it as "Neoconservative meets Cold War." Rubio's stance on foreign policy has been a hallmark of his Senate service and presidential campaign.
