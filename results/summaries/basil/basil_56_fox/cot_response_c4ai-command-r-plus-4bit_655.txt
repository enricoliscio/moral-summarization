SUMMARY:
In his first major foreign policy speech since launching his presidential campaign, Senator Marco Rubio outlined a strong moral and military vision for the United States. Rubio criticized the Obama administration for what he saw as their overly cautious and morally disdainful approach to foreign policy, which he believes has weakened America's global standing. Rubio emphasized the need for American strength, prioritizing a well-funded military to protect the nation's economic interests and moral leadership. He characterized Obama as too willing to acquiesce to hostile foreign governments and criticized his approach to Cuba and Iran. Rubio asserted that the world is safest when America is strongest and that the nation must be willing to respond decisively to aggressive nations that undermine global commerce. He also emphasized the importance of standing up for American principles and opposing regimes that oppress their citizens. Rubio's foreign policy agenda, with its emphasis on military might and moral purpose, stands in contrast to the current administration's focus on diplomacy and dialogue. Rubio defended his stance on maintaining the embargo on Cuba, arguing that engaging with the country is to avail oneself of stolen properties. He also expressed distrust of Iran, stating that they cannot be trusted in nuclear negotiations. Rubio's speech highlighted his hawkish approach to foreign policy and his belief in the need for a strong, morally-driven American presence on the world stage.
