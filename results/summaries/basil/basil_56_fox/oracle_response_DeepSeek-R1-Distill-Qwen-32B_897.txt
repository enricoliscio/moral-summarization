Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I should start by reading the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. He talks about restoring American strength, military funding, and moral leadership. He criticizes Obama's administration for being too cautious and not upholding American values. He mentions specific examples like Russia, Iran, and Cuba. The DNC responds negatively, calling his approach outdated.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of the listed moral words as possible. Words like crises, threats, restore, fund, disregard, Iran, Cuba, reset, opening, embraced, undermine, block, response, stuck, ineffective, negligent, hostile, oppression, peace, failed, lifted.

I should structure the summary to cover Rubio's priorities: military strength, addressing threats, and moral leadership. He criticizes Obama for being too cautious, leading to a loss of influence. He wants to take aggressive steps against nations undermining global commerce. He also opposes Obama's policies towards Cuba and Iran, emphasizing that the U.S. must maintain its principles.

I should mention the DNC's criticism, labeling Rubio's approach as outdated. Also, note Rubio's tougher stance compared to other Republicans and his belief that a strong military leads to peace.

I need to keep the summary concise, around 200 words, and include the moral framing words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered with the appropriate terminology.

SUMMARY:  
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, in his first major foreign policy speech since launching his presidential campaign, emphasized the need to restore American strength and moral leadership. He criticized the Obama administration for being overly cautious in addressing global crises, arguing that the U.S. has lost its standing as a world military and moral power. Rubio called for aggressive steps to counter nations like China, Iran, and Russia, which he accused of undermining global commerce and international laws. He vowed to fund the military adequately, even in times of peace, and stressed the importance of forethought in building capabilities to address threats. Rubio criticized Obama for disregarding America's moral purpose, citing policies like the "reset" with Russia and open-handed approaches to Iran and Cuba as examples of acquiescence to hostile regimes. He also opposed Obama's Cuba policy, calling it stuck in the Cold War, and defended the embargo, arguing it was not to blame for Cuba's failed economy. Rubio accused Iran of having a secret nuclear program and warned against lifting sanctions. He criticized Hillary Clinton's foreign policy as ineffective and negligent. The DNC labeled Rubio's approach as outdated, with no plan for progress on issues like Iran or a two-state solution for Israel. Rubio, however, argued that a mightier U.S. military would lead to global peace, not conflict, and opposed dialogues with regimes that oppress political dissidents. END OF SUMMARY.
