SUMMARY: In his first major foreign policy speech since launching his presidential campaign, Sen. Marco Rubio outlined his vision for U.S. global leadership. He criticized the Obama administration for weakening America's military and moral power, and pledged to prioritize a strong military and take aggressive action against nations that undermine global commerce. Rubio characterized Obama as too willing to acquiesce to foreign governments and portrayed himself as a hawk, advocating for a tougher stance on Cuba, Iran, and other nations. He argued that a strong U.S. military presence leads to more peace, not conflict. Rubio also stated that the U.S. must prioritize its own economic interests and respond decisively to nations like China and Iran that attempt to undermine them. Rubio's foreign policy agenda has been a hallmark of his campaign, and he has taken a harder line than some of his Republican colleagues on issues like Cuba and Iran. The Democratic National Committee criticized Rubio's approach as "neoconservative meets Cold War." Rubio defended his stance, saying that strong U.S. leadership is necessary to maintain global peace and stability.
