SUMMARY:
In his first major foreign policy speech since launching his presidential campaign, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio outlined his vision for American foreign policy. Rubio emphasized the need for a strong military presence and aggressive strategies to counter nations that undermine global commerce. He criticized the Obama administration for its overly cautious approach, which he believes has diminished America's moral standing and power in the world. Rubio accused Obama of disregarding America's moral purpose and "flirting with disdain" by acquiescing to foreign governments that oppose American principles. He promised to prioritize the military and take a tougher stance on nations like China, Iran, and Cuba. Rubio defended his opposition to diplomatic relations with Cuba, arguing that engaging with the country avails oneself of properties stolen by the Cuban government. He also emphasized the need for the U.S. to remain morally vigilant, stating that the world is safest when America is strongest. Rubio criticized Obama for embracing regimes that oppose American principles and for wasting no time in stripping America's strength. He characterized former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's foreign policy as a "disaster" and accused her of being dangerously negligent. Rubio concluded by expressing distrust in Iran, citing its secret nuclear program.
