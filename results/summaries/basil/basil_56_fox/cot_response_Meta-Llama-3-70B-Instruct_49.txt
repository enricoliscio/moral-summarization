SUMMARY:
In his first major foreign policy speech, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio emphasized the need for a strong military and a strong moral leader to restore America's place in the world. He criticized the Obama administration's "arrogance" and "disdain" for America's moral purpose, accusing the president of being overly cautious and eager to acquiesce to foreign governments that undermine global commerce. Rubio vowed to take aggressive steps to fight nations that undermine global commerce and ensure the U.S. is a world moral leader. He also promised to adequately fund the military, even in times of peace and stability, to maintain America's strength. Rubio's foreign policy agenda is often hawkish in approach, and he has taken tougher stances on foreign policy than some of his Republican colleagues. END OF SUMMARY.
