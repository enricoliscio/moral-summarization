Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article mentions that Rubio, a U.S. Senator from Florida, delivered his first major foreign policy speech since starting his presidential campaign. He emphasized a few key points: a strong military, aggressive steps against nations that disrupt global commerce, and positioning the U.S. as a world moral leader. He criticized the Obama administration for being too cautious, leading to a decline in American strength.

He talked about funding the military even in peaceful times, which makes sense because having a strong military is seen as a deterrent. He also criticized Obama for being too soft, like with Russia, Iran, and Cuba. Rubio believes the U.S. should be more assertive, especially against countries like China and Iran that threaten economic interests.

The Democratic National Committee responded, pointing out what they see as flaws in Rubio's plan, like keeping troops in the Middle East permanently and not engaging in diplomatic solutions. They called his approach "neoconservative meets Cold War."

Rubio's stance is hawkish, which is more aggressive, and he's even tougher than some of his GOP colleagues. He supports military strength as a way to ensure peace and criticized Obama for focusing too much on diplomacy instead of action.

He also discussed Cuba, maintaining the embargo and not opening relations, unlike some Republicans. He believes the embargo isn't the cause of Cuba's economic issues. On Iran, he's skeptical, saying they can't be trusted even if sanctions are lifted.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Rubio's main priorities, his criticism of Obama, the DNC's response, and his stance on specific countries like Cuba and Iran. I'll make sure to highlight the key points without getting too detailed.
