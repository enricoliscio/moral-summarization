SUMMARY:

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio delivered a foreign policy speech, emphasizing the need for a strong military and aggressive steps to combat nations that undermine global commerce. He criticized the Obama administration's "disregard for our moral purpose" and "flirtation with disdain" towards foreign governments that have "thumbed their noses" at the U.S. and international laws. Rubio vowed to prioritize funding the military, even in times of peace and stability, to restore American strength and ensure the country remains a world moral leader. He warned that aggressive nations like China and Iran will face a response from his administration if they attempt to block global commerce. Rubio also criticized Obama's foreign policy, calling it a "disaster" and accusing him of being "negligent" and "ineffective" in his dealings with hostile governments. Rubio's stance on foreign policy is often hawkish, and he has taken tougher positions than some of his Republican colleagues. He believes that "the world is at its safest when America is at its strongest."
