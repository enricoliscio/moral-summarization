SUMMARY:

In his first major foreign policy speech, Senator Marco Rubio emphasized the need for a strong military and aggressive steps to combat nations that undermine global commerce. He criticized the Obama administration's "disregard for our moral purpose" and "flirtation with disdain" towards foreign governments that have "thumbed their noses" at the US and international laws. Rubio argued that the US is losing its place as a world moral leader due to Obama's "overly cautious responses" to crises overseas. He vowed to prioritize funding the military and take decisive action against aggressive nations like China and Iran that attempt to "block global commerce". Rubio also criticized Obama's policies towards Cuba and Iran, calling them "ineffective" and "negligent". He emphasized that "the world is at its safest when America is at its strongest" and that a strong military leads to "more peace, not more conflict".
