SUMMARY: In his first major foreign policy speech, Senator Marco Rubio criticized the Obama administration's approach to global crises, arguing that the U.S. is losing its moral and military power. Rubio emphasized the need for a strong U.S. military presence and his priority to fund it adequately. He accused Obama of disregarding America's moral purpose and acquiescing to hostile foreign governments, such as Russia, Iran, and Cuba. Rubio pledged to take aggressive steps against nations that undermine global commerce and block U.S. economic interests. He defended his stance on maintaining the embargo on Cuba, blaming the country's failed economy on the Cuban government, not the embargo. Rubio criticized Obama's approach to diplomacy and his willingness to engage with hostile nations. He stated that a strong America leads to more peace, not conflict. Rubio's hawkish foreign policy agenda has been a hallmark of his campaign and Senate service. He believes that the U.S. must prioritize its military strength and moral leadership on the world stage.
