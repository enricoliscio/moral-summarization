Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that Rubio, a U.S. Senator from Florida, gave his first major foreign policy speech as part of his presidential campaign. He talked about several key priorities: a strong military, taking aggressive steps against nations that undermine global commerce, and making the U.S. a world moral leader.

He criticized the Obama administration for being too cautious and not maintaining the U.S.'s role as a global military and moral power. Rubio mentioned that threats have changed since the Cold War, but the need for American strength has only increased because the world is more interconnected.

He emphasized funding the military as his top priority, even in times of peace, which he doesn't think is the case now since the world isn't peaceful or stable. He criticized Obama for being too soft, saying Obama erred by being too eager to acquiesce to foreign governments that oppose the U.S. and international laws. He gave examples like Obama's policies towards Russia, Iran, and Cuba, calling them misguided.

Rubio also talked about taking decisive action against countries like China and Iran that threaten U.S. economic interests. He said any nation blocking global commerce would face a response from his administration. He criticized Obama for embracing regimes that oppose American principles.

The Democratic National Committee responded, calling Rubio's policies outdated and hawkish, mentioning issues like permanent troops in the Middle East and a Cuba policy stuck in the Cold War.

Rubio's foreign policy is described as often being hawkish, which has been a focus of his Senate work and now his campaign. He believes the U.S. must have a strong military to ensure peace. He criticized Obama and Hillary Clinton for their foreign policies, calling them ineffective or negligent.

He also discussed Cuba, defending the embargo, and Iran, stating that Iran cannot be trusted with its nuclear program even after sanctions are lifted.

So, to summarize, I need to capture Rubio's main points: strong military funding, criticism of Obama's foreign policy, focus on economic interests, hawkish approach, and specific criticisms of Cuba and Iran policies. Also, include the DNC's response and Rubio's belief in American strength leading to peace.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me structure it step by step:

1. Rubio's speech as part of his campaign, main priorities.
2. Criticism of Obama's cautious approach, leading to loss of U.S. influence.
3. Emphasis on military funding as top priority.
4. Criticism of Obama's policies towards Russia, Iran, Cuba.
5. Decision to take action against nations threatening U.S. economic interests.
6. DNC's criticism of Rubio's policies as outdated.
7. Rubio's hawkish approach, focus on military strength for peace.
8. Specific points on Cuba and Iran.

I need to make sure each point is covered succinctly without getting too detailed. Also, avoid including every minor point to keep it under 200 words.

Let me draft the summary now, ensuring it flows well and covers all key points.
