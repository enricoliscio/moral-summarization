Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Rubio gave his first major foreign policy speech since starting his presidential campaign. He talked about prioritizing a strong military, taking aggressive steps against nations that undermine global commerce, and ensuring the U.S. is a world moral leader. He criticized the Obama administration for being too cautious and for not maintaining the U.S.'s position as a military and moral power.

He mentioned that the threats have changed since the Cold War, but the need for American strength has grown. He emphasized funding the military even in peaceful times, which he sees as crucial. He criticized Obama for being too eager to appease foreign governments, like Iran and Cuba, and for not standing up for U.S. principles. Rubio also talked about taking decisive action against countries like China and Iran when they threaten U.S. economic interests.

The Democratic National Committee responded, calling his policies outdated andhawkish. Rubio's approach is seen as more aggressive than some of his Republican peers, especially regarding Cuba and Iran. He also defended the embargo on Cuba, stating it's not the cause of Cuba's economic issues and criticized Obama for embracing regimes that oppose U.S. principles.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Rubio's main priorities: military strength, aggressive action against threats, moral leadership. His criticism of Obama's policies, the DNC's response, and his stance on Cuba and Iran are key points. I should also mention his hawkish approach compared to other Republicans.

Let me structure this: Start with Rubio's speech, his priorities, criticism of Obama, his stance on military funding, actions against China, Iran, etc., DNC's criticism, and his tough stance on Cuba and Iran compared to other Republicans.

I need to make sure it's concise and covers all main points without getting too detailed. Let me check the word count as I go to stay under 200.
