Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing that the author provided. The article is about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech, so I should focus on his key points and the moral stance he takes.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main points. Rubio emphasizes a strong military, taking aggressive steps against nations that undermine global commerce, and positioning the U.S. as a world moral leader. He criticizes Obama's administration for being too cautious and not upholding American strength and moral purpose.

I should note that Rubio believes the world is more interconnected, so American strength is more necessary now. He mentions funding the military even in peaceful times, which is a priority for him. He also criticizes Obama for being too eager to acquiesce to foreign governments, leading to a disregard for American moral principles.

Rubio targets specific countries like China, Iran, and Russia, stating that the U.S. should respond decisively to their actions. He also opposes Obama's policies towards Cuba and Iran, maintaining a tough stance. The Democratic response criticizes Rubio's approach as outdated andhawkish.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes these elements: Rubio's priorities, his criticism of Obama's policies, the moral leadership aspect, and the Democratic counterarguments. I should maintain the moral framing, so words like "moral leader," "disregard for moral purpose," and "upholding principles" are important.

I'll structure the summary by first introducing Rubio's speech, then his priorities, followed by his critique of Obama, mention of specific countries, and the Democratic response. I'll make sure to keep it clear and within the word limit.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it flows logically and covers all key points without being too detailed. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words and that the moral framing is preserved as per the original text.
