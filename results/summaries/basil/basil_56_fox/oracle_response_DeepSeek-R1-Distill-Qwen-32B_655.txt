Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want a summary of a news article, preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I need to understand the article. It's about Marco Rubio's foreign policy speech, where he criticizes Obama's administration for being too cautious and not maintaining the U.S. as a global moral leader. He emphasizes a strong military, taking aggressive steps against nations that undermine global commerce, and restoring American strength.

Next, I should identify the key points: Rubio's priorities, his criticism of Obama, the need for a strong military, addressing threats from China and Iran, and the DNC's response. I need to include the morally framed words like "crises," "threats," "restore," "fund," "disregard," "embrace," "undermine," "response," "disaster," "hostile," "oppression," "peace," "failed," "negligent."

I should structure the summary to include Rubio's main points, his criticism of Obama, and the DNC's counterpoints. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words to maintain the author's framing. I'll keep each sentence concise and focused on the main ideas without getting too detailed.

Let me start drafting: Rubio emphasizes a strong military and moral leadership. Criticizes Obama for being too cautious, leading to loss of influence. Highlights threats from China, Iran, etc., needing a decisive response. DNC labels his policy as outdated, criticizing his approach. Rubio's hawkish stance includes military funding, opposing diplomatic openings with Cuba and Iran, and maintaining sanctions.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all key elements without exceeding 200 words. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed, making sure all important points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, in his first major foreign policy speech, emphasized restoring American strength and moral leadership by prioritizing a strong military and taking aggressive steps against nations that undermine global commerce. He criticized the Obama administration for being overly cautious in crises, leading to a loss of U.S. influence. Rubio argued that threats to America have grown more pressing as the world has become more interconnected, requiring forethought to design and build capabilities for future needs. He accused Obama of disregarding America's moral purpose, embracing regimes that oppose U.S. principles, and failing to act decisively against hostile nations like China and Iran. Rubio also criticized Obama's policies toward Cuba and Iran, calling them ineffective and negligent. He opposed diplomatic openings with Cuba, citing stolen properties and the failed economy, and maintained that the embargo should remain. Rubio's hawkish approach includes funding the military, countering threats, and avoiding dialogue with hostile regimes. The DNC labeled his policy as outdated and criticized his lack of a plan for Iran. Rubio defended his stance, asserting that a strong America brings peace, not conflict. END OF SUMMARY.
