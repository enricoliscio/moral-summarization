SUMMARY:

US Senator Marco Rubio delivered his first major foreign policy speech since launching his presidential campaign, emphasizing the need for a strong military and aggressive steps to fight nations that undermine global commerce. Rubio criticized the Obama administration's cautious responses to crises overseas, saying it has led to the US losing its place as a world military and moral power. He promised to prioritize funding the military and take decisive action against nations like China and Iran that attempt to undermine US economic interests. Rubio also reiterated his opposition to normalizing relations with Cuba and Iran, saying they cannot be trusted. He accused Obama of being overly concerned with softening the US's image and embracing regimes that oppose American principles. The Democratic National Committee responded, labeling Rubio's approach as "neoconservative" and stuck in the Cold War era.
