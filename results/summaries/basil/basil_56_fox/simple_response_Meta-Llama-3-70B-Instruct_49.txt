SUMMARY:

In his first major foreign policy speech, Sen. Marco Rubio emphasized the need for a strong military and a robust response to nations that undermine global commerce. He criticized the Obama administration's cautious approach, saying it has led to the US losing its place as a world moral leader. Rubio vowed to prioritize military funding, even in times of peace, to restore American strength. He accused Obama of being overly concerned with avoiding the perception of the US as a bully, leading to a lack of action against foreign governments that defy international laws. Rubio also promised to take decisive action against nations like China and Iran that attempt to undermine US economic interests. He reiterated his opposition to normalizing relations with Cuba and Iran, citing their human rights records and untrustworthiness. Rubio's speech was met with criticism from the Democratic National Committee, which labeled his approach as "neoconservative" and "stuck in the Cold War."
