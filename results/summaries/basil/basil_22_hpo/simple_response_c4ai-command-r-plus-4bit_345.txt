SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misrepresenting Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which disproportionately hurts the poor. In a letter to Rep. Ryan, the scholars express their objection to his recent comments defending his budget on Christian grounds. They emphasize that his budget contradicts the teachings of the gospel, which promotes compassion and love rather than Social Darwinism. The group, which includes over a dozen Jesuit priests and scholars from various departments, cites the devastating impact of cuts to food programs and Pell Grants, which will make it difficult for low-income students to access education. They also correct Rep. Ryan's misinterpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," clarifying that while it calls for local communities to enact solutions, it also demands that higher levels of government provide help when communities face challenges beyond their means. The scholars recommend that Rep. Ryan read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to better understand Catholic social teaching. This response from the Georgetown community adds to the chorus of Catholic leaders and theologians who have spoken out against Rep. Ryan's misuse of their faith to justify his budget's harmful impact on the vulnerable.
