SUMMARY:
Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators, including over a dozen Jesuit priests, have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misrepresenting Catholic social teaching to defend his budget. They argue that Ryan's budget, which includes harmful cuts to programs that support the poor, contradicts the values of the Catholic faith. The group sent a letter to Rep. Ryan ahead of his lecture at Georgetown, refuting his claim that his budget aligns with Catholic social teaching. They cite the US Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress, which stated that a just budget cannot rely on disproportionate cuts to services for the poor. Father Thomas J. Reese, one of the organizers of the letter, accused Ryan of prioritizing the values of Ayn Rand over the gospel of Jesus Christ. The scholars highlighted the harmful impact of cuts to food programs and Pell Grants, which help low-income students access higher education. They also corrected Ryan's misinterpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity." The signatories, including experts in Theology and other fields, urged Rep. Ryan to refer to the Vatican-published "Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to better understand Catholic social teaching. END OF SUMMARY.
