Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Georgetown University faculty criticizing Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching in his budget. They sent him a letter before his lecture. They're not against him speaking, just his misuse of the teachings. The budget cuts affect the poor. They quote bishops saying the budget fails moral criteria. Ryan dismissed the bishops, saying their letters didn't represent all bishops, which the USCCB denied. The scholars mention the impact on food programs and Pell Grants. They correct Ryan's use of "subsidiarity," explaining it requires higher government help when needed. They also assigned him a reading on Catholic social doctrine. The letter was signed by many faculty members from various departments.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main action: Georgetown faculty criticizing Ryan. Mention the misuse of Catholic teachings, the impact on the poor, the bishops' stance, Ryan's dismissal, the scholars' points about subsidiarity, and the reading assignment. Keep it concise and include key details without getting too wordy.

Let me draft it:

Georgetown University faculty criticized Rep. Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching in his budget, which harms the poor. They sent a letter before his campus lecture, objecting to his Christian defense of the budget. They argue his claims are incorrect and that the budget fails moral criteria. Ryan dismissed bishops' critiques, which the USCCB denied. Scholars highlighted the impact on food programs and education grants. They corrected his use of "subsidiarity," emphasizing the need for government help when local communities can't address issues. They assigned him a Vatican text on social doctrine. The letter was signed by many faculty across departments.

That's under 200 words. I think it covers all key points.
