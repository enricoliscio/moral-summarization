SUMMARY:

Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan's misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue hurts the poor. The group, including Jesuit priests and scholars from various departments, sent a letter to Ryan ahead of his lecture on campus, stating that his budget has a "devastating impact" on programs for the poor and contradicts Catholic values. They quote the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who have also condemned Ryan's budget for failing to meet moral criteria. The scholars argue that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ, and that his interpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity" is misguided. They emphasize that higher levels of government have a responsibility to provide help to communities in need. The letter serves as a moral rebuke to Ryan's policies, urging him to reconsider his budget in light of Catholic social teaching.
