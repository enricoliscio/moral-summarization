SUMMARY:

Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which hurts the poor. The scholars argue that Ryan's claims of basing his budget on Catholic principles are nonsense, as it has a devastating impact on programs for the poor. They quote the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which stated that a just framework for future budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to poor persons. The bishops noted that the House-passed budget resolution fails to meet these moral criteria. The scholars point out that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ, which emphasizes compassion and love. They also correct Ryan's misuse of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," which demands that higher levels of government provide help when communities face problems beyond their means to address. The scholars urge Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to understand Catholic social teaching.
