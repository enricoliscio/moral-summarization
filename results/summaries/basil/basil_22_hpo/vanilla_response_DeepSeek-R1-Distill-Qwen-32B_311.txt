Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about Georgetown University faculty criticizing Paul Ryan's budget. They sent him a letter before his lecture at Georgetown. The main issue is that they believe Ryan is misusing Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they say hurts the poor.

I should identify the key points. First, who is involved: nearly 90 Georgetown faculty and administrators. They're part of a larger group including bishops, theologians, etc., criticizing Ryan. The main action is sending a letter to Ryan, not objecting to his speech but his use of Catholic teachings to defend his budget.

The scholars argue that Ryan's budget doesn't align with Catholic social teaching, which emphasizes helping the poor. They quote the USCCB, which criticized Ryan's budget for failing moral criteria. Ryan dismissed the bishops' critique, claiming their letters didn't represent all bishops, which the USCCB denied.

They also mention specific impacts like cuts in food programs and Pell Grants, affecting low-income students. The scholars correct Ryan's use of "subsidiarity," explaining it requires higher government involvement when local communities can't handle issues. They even gave him a reading assignment: the Compendium of Social Doctrine.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements: who, what, why, and the key arguments. Also, end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue harms the poor. In a letter sent before Ryan's campus lecture, the scholars emphasized their objection to his Christian-based defense of the budget, not his speaking engagement. They argue that Ryan's budget contradicts Catholic principles, particularly the bishops' emphasis on protecting programs for the poor. The scholars also corrected Ryan's interpretation of "subsidiarity," stating it requires higher government involvement in addressing issues like poverty and unemployment, not just local solutions. They referenced the USCCB's criticism of Ryan's budget and urged him to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church." The letter highlights concerns over cuts to food programs and Pell Grants, which disproportionately affect low-income individuals. END OF SUMMARY.
