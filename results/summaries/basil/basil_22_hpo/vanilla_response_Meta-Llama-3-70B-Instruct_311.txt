SUMMARY:

Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan's (R-Wisc.) use of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue hurts the poor. In a letter to Ryan, the scholars, including Jesuit priests and theologians, disputed his claim that his budget is based on Catholic social teaching, citing the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' opposition to the budget. The bishops had written to Congress stating that the budget fails to meet moral criteria and disproportionately cuts essential services to the poor. The scholars argued that Ryan's budget reflects the values of philosopher Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ, and pointed to the devastating impact of cuts in food programs and Pell Grants. They also corrected Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," emphasizing that it demands higher levels of government provide help when local communities face problems beyond their means.
