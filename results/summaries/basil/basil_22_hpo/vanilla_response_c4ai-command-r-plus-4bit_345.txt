SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misrepresenting Catholic social teaching to defend his budget proposal, which includes significant cuts to programs that aid the poor. In a letter to Rep. Ryan, the scholars express concern over his recent comments justifying his budget on Christian grounds. They reference the US Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress, which stated that a just budget framework should not rely on disproportionate cuts to services for the poor, a moral criterion that the House-passed budget resolution fails to meet. Father Thomas J. Reese, one of the organizers of the letter, noted that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ. The scholars also highlighted the harmful impact of cuts to food programs and Pell Grants, and clarified the true meaning of "subsidiarity," a concept Ryan misused to justify his budget. They recommended Rep. Ryan read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to better understand Catholic social teaching. Over a dozen Jesuit priests and numerous faculty members from various departments at Georgetown University signed the letter, emphasizing their objection to Ryan's misuse of Catholic teachings to justify a budget that harms the most vulnerable members of society.
