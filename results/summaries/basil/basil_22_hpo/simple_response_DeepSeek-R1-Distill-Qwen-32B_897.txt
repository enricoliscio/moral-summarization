Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about Georgetown University faculty and administrators criticizing Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching in his budget. They sent him a letter before his lecture at Georgetown. The key points are:

1. The group includes nearly 90 faculty and administrators.
2. They object to Ryan's use of Catholic teachings to justify his budget, which harms the poor.
3. They reference the USCCB's statements against disproportionate cuts to essential services for the poor.
4. Ryan dismissed the bishops' critique, claiming it didn't represent all bishops, which was denied by the USCCB media office.
5. Father Reese criticizes Ryan's budget as reflecting Ayn Rand's philosophy instead of Christian values.
6. They mention the impact of cuts on food programs and Pell Grants, affecting low-income students.
7. They correct Ryan's use of "subsidiarity," explaining it requires higher government support when local communities can't handle issues.
8. They assigned Ryan a reading on Catholic social doctrine.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, keeping the moral critique intact. I'll focus on the main criticisms and the scholars' arguments against Ryan's misuse of Catholic teachings. I'll ensure to mention the impact on the poor, the correction of subsidiarity, and the reference to the Compendium.

Let me structure it: start with the action (sending the letter), state the objection, reference the bishops' statements, mention Ryan's dismissal, the scholars' counterpoints, and the consequences of his budget. I'll end with their request for him to read the Compendium.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the summary clear and concise, highlighting the moral arguments against Ryan's budget.

SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue harms the poor. In a letter to Ryan, they objected to his claim that his budget aligns with Catholic teachings, asserting that his proposals disproportionately cut essential services for vulnerable populations. The scholars referenced the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who have criticized Ryan's budget for failing moral criteria, particularly its impact on programs for the poor. Ryan dismissed this critique, erroneously claiming it did not represent all bishops. The Georgetown group also corrected Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic principle of "subsidiarity," emphasizing that it requires higher levels of government to assist local communities when they cannot address issues like poverty and unemployment alone. The scholars urged Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church," a Vatican publication, to better understand Catholic social teaching. END OF SUMMARY.
