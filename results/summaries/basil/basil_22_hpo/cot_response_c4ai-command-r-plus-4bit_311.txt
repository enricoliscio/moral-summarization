SUMMARY:
Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have called out Representative Paul Ryan for his misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue hurts the poor. In a letter sent to Rep. Ryan ahead of his lecture at the Catholic campus, the scholars clarify that they do not object to his speaking engagement but take issue with his claims that his budget is rooted in Catholic social teaching. They echo the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' stance that a just budget framework should not rely on disproportionate cuts to services for the poor. Rep. Ryan dismissed the bishops' critique, but the scholars argue that his budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ, prioritizing "survival of the fittest" over compassion and love. The scholars highlight the harmful impact of cuts to food programs and Pell Grants, which will make it challenging for low-income students to access education. They also correct Rep. Ryan's interpretation of "subsidiarity," emphasizing that while solutions should be enacted at the local level, higher levels of government must provide aid when communities face challenges beyond their means. The scholars urge Rep. Ryan to refer to the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, underscoring their commitment to moral justice and the well-being of the poor.
