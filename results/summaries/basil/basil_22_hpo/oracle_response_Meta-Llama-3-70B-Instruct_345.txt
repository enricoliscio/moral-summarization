SUMMARY:

Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) for misusing Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which hurts the poor. The scholars argue that Ryan's claims that his budget is based on Catholic social teaching are "nonsense." They point out that the budget has a devastating impact on programs for the poor, citing the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress. The bishops stated that a just framework for future budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to poor persons, and that the House-passed budget resolution fails to meet these moral criteria. The scholars also corrected Ryan's use of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity" as a rationale for gutting government programs, emphasizing that it demands higher levels of government provide help when communities face problems beyond their means. The scholars urged Ryan to revisit Catholic social teaching, citing the gospel of Jesus Christ, which emphasizes compassion and love.
