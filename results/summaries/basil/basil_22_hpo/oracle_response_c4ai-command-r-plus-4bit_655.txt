SUMMARY: Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for his misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which hurts the poor. In a letter sent to Rep. Ryan, the scholars objected to his recent comments claiming that his budget is based on Catholic values, calling it "nonsense." They pointed to the devastating impact of cuts in food programs and Pell Grants, which will make it difficult for low-income students to pursue their educations. The letter also corrected Rep. Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," stating that it demands higher levels of government provide help when local communities face problems beyond their means. The scholars recommended that Rep. Ryan read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to better understand Catholic social teaching. Father Thomas J. Reese, one of the organizers of the letter, said that Rep. Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ, and that survival of the fittest is not consistent with the gospel of compassion and love.
END OF SUMMARY.
