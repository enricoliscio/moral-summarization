SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misrepresenting Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which disproportionately hurts the poor. In a letter to Rep. Ryan, the scholars objected to his recent comments defending his budget on Christian grounds, citing the US Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress arguing against relying on cuts to essential services for the poor. Father Thomas J. Reese, one of the organizers of the letter, stated that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ. The scholars also highlighted the negative impact of cuts to food programs and Pell Grants, and corrected Ryan's misinterpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity." They recommended he read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to better understand Catholic social teaching. Over a dozen Jesuit priests and scholars from various departments at Georgetown signed the letter, demonstrating a united front against the misuse of religious doctrine to justify harmful budgetary decisions.
