SUMMARY: Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for his misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which hurts the poor. In a letter to Ryan, the scholars objected to his claims that his budget is based on Catholic values, citing the devastating impact of cuts to food programs and education grants for low-income students. They also corrected Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," arguing that it demands higher levels of government provide help when local communities are faced with challenges beyond their means. The group, which included Jesuit priests and theologians, referenced the US Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress criticizing budgets that rely on disproportionate cuts to services for the poor. Father Thomas J. Reese, one of the organizers of the letter, stated that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of compassion and love. The scholars urged Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to better understand Catholic social teaching.
