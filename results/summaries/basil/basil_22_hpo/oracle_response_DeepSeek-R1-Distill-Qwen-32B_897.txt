Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Georgetown faculty criticizing Paul Ryan's budget. First, I need to identify the key points. They mention misuse of Catholic teachings, impact on the poor, and specific criticisms like cuts in food programs and Pell Grants. I should use the morally charged words like "misuse," "hurts," "devastating," etc. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and ends with the specified tokens. I'll structure it to highlight the faculty's objections, their reasons, and the moral arguments they use. Also, I should include the part about the Compendium of Social Doctrine to show their stance. Let me put it all together clearly.

SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) for his misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue hurts the poor. In a letter sent before his campus appearance, they objected to his claims that his budget is based on Catholic principles, calling his assertions "nonsense." They emphasized that his budget has a devastating impact on programs for the poor, citing the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who condemned disproportionate cuts to essential services. The scholars accused Ryan of relying on Ayn Rand's philosophy rather than the gospel of compassion and love. They also corrected his misuse of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," explaining that it demands higher levels of government to provide help when local communities cannot address issues like poverty and unemployment. The letter, signed by Jesuit priests and scholars across multiple departments, urged Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church." END OF SUMMARY.
