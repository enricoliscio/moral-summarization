Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about Georgetown University faculty and administrators criticizing Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching in his budget. They sent him a letter before his lecture at Georgetown. The main points are that they're not against him speaking, just his misuse of the teachings to justify a budget that hurts the poor. They quote the USCCB saying his budget doesn't meet moral criteria. Ryan dismissed the bishops, saying their letters didn't represent all bishops, which they denied. The scholars also correct his use of subsidiarity, pointing out it requires higher government help when needed. They gave him a reading assignment too. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key elements: who is involved, their main objection, the misuse of teachings, the impact on the poor, the correction on subsidiarity, and the reading assignment. I'll make sure it's clear and concise, hitting all the main points without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching to justify his budget, which they argue harms the poor. In a letter sent before Ryan's campus lecture, the scholars, including Jesuit Father Thomas J. Reese, argued that Ryan's claims about his budget aligning with Catholic teachings are incorrect. They referenced the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who have criticized Ryan's budget for failing to meet moral criteria, particularly in its impact on programs for the poor. Ryan had dismissed the bishops' critique, erroneously claiming it didn't represent all bishops. The scholars also corrected Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic principle of subsidiarity, emphasizing that it requires higher levels of government to assist when local communities cannot address issues like poverty and unemployment. The letter, signed by Georgetown Jesuit priests and scholars from various departments, urged Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church." END OF SUMMARY.
