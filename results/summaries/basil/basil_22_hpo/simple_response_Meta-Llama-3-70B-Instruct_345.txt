SUMMARY:

Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators, including Jesuit priests and scholars from various departments, have criticized Representative Paul Ryan's misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue hurts the poor. They contend that Ryan's budget is not grounded in Catholic values, but rather reflects the philosophy of Ayn Rand. The scholars point out that the budget's cuts to food programs and Pell Grants will have devastating impacts on the poor and low-income students. They correct Ryan's misunderstanding of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," emphasizing that it requires higher levels of government to provide help when local communities face problems beyond their means. The scholars urge Ryan to revisit Catholic social teaching, citing the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' critique of his budget. By speaking out, the Georgetown scholars aim to uphold the values of compassion and love embodied in the gospel of Jesus Christ.
