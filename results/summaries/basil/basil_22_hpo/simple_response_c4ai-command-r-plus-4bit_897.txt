SUMMARY: Georgetown University faculty and administrators criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misrepresenting Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which disproportionately harms the poor. They objected to his claims that his budget is based on Catholic values, citing the US Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress arguing against disproportionate cuts to services for the poor. Father Thomas J. Reese, one of the organizers of the letter, pointed out the contradiction between Ryan's budget and the gospel of compassion and love. The scholars also corrected Ryan's misinterpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," emphasizing that it demands higher levels of government provide aid when local communities are overwhelmed. The letter, signed by Jesuit priests and scholars from various departments, underscored the moral obligation to prioritize the well-being of the most vulnerable members of society. They urged Ryan to consider the teachings of the Catholic Church and rethink his budget priorities.
