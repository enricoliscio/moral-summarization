SUMMARY: Georgetown University faculty and administrators criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misrepresenting Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which disproportionately hurts the poor. They objected to his claims that his budget reflects Catholic values, citing the US Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress arguing against disproportionate cuts to services for the poor. Father Thomas J. Reese, one of the organizers of the letter, stated that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ. The scholars highlighted the harmful impact of cuts to food programs and Pell Grants, and clarified the true meaning of "subsidiarity," emphasizing the responsibility of higher levels of government to aid local communities facing challenges beyond their means. They recommended Ryan read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" for a better understanding of Catholic social teaching. The letter, signed by Jesuit priests and scholars from various departments, asserted that Ryan's budget contradicts the gospel of compassion and love.
