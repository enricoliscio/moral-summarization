SUMMARY:

A group of nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators, including Jesuit priests and theologians, have criticized Representative Paul Ryan's misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue hurts the poor. They contend that Ryan's budget contradicts Catholic values of compassion and love, instead reflecting the philosophy of Ayn Rand. The scholars point to the devastating impact of cuts in food programs and Pell Grants, which will disproportionately affect low-income individuals. They correct Ryan's misunderstanding of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," emphasizing that it demands higher levels of government provide help when local communities face problems beyond their means. The scholars urge Ryan to revisit Catholic social teaching, citing the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' critique of his budget. By misusing Catholic social teaching, Ryan is perpetuating a "survival of the fittest" mentality that is antithetical to the gospel of Jesus Christ.
