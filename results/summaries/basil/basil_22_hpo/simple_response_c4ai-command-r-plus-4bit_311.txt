SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misrepresenting Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which disproportionately hurts the poor. In a letter sent to Rep. Ryan ahead of his lecture at the Catholic campus, the scholars objected to his recent comments defending his budget on Christian grounds. They pointed out that Ryan's budget contradicts the teachings of the gospel of compassion and love, and that it would have a devastating impact on food programs that keep the poor from starvation and on Pell Grants that help low-income students access education. The letter also corrected Ryan's misinterpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," emphasizing that while it calls for local communities to take ownership of solutions, it also demands that higher levels of government provide help when communities face challenges beyond their means. The scholars recommended that Rep. Ryan read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to better understand Catholic social teaching. Among the signatories were Georgetown Jesuit priests and scholars from various departments.
