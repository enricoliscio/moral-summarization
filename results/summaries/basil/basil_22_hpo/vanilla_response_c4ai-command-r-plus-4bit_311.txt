SUMMARY: Nearly 90 faculty and administrators from Georgetown University have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misrepresenting Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which adversely affects the poor. In a letter sent to Ryan ahead of his lecture at the Catholic campus, the scholars objected to his recent comments justifying his budget based on Christian values. They highlighted the negative impact of cuts to food programs and Pell Grants, which help low-income students access higher education. The letter also corrected Ryan's misinterpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," explaining that while it calls for local community involvement, it also demands that higher levels of government provide support when issues exceed local capabilities. The group, which included Jesuit priests and scholars from various departments, referenced the US Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress opposing disproportionate cuts to services for the poor. They recommended Ryan read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to better understand Catholic social teaching. Father Thomas J. Reese, one of the organizers, stated that Ryan's budget reflected the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of compassion and love.
END OF SUMMARY.
