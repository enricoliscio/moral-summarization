SUMMARY:

Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan's (R-Wisc.) use of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue hurts the poor. In a letter, they claim that Ryan's budget contradicts Catholic values and has a devastating impact on programs for the poor. They quote the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which has also criticized Ryan's budget for failing to meet moral criteria. The scholars argue that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ, and that his interpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity" is incorrect. They point to the negative effects of cuts in food programs and Pell Grants, and assign Ryan a reading assignment: "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church". The letter was signed by over a dozen Georgetown Jesuit priests and numerous faculty members from various departments.
