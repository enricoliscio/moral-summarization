SUMMARY:

Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan's (R-Wisc.) use of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue hurts the poor. In a letter, the scholars, including Jesuit priests and theologians, claim that Ryan's budget has a "devastating impact" on programs for the poor, contradicting Catholic social teaching. They cite the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which has written that a just budget cannot rely on disproportionate cuts to essential services for the poor. The scholars also correct Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," arguing that it demands higher levels of government provide help when local communities face problems beyond their means. The letter was sent in advance of Ryan's appearance at Georgetown University, where he was scheduled to give a lecture.
