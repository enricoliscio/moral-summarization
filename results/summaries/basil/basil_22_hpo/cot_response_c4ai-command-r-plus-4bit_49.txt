SUMMARY:
Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators, including over a dozen Jesuit priests and many scholars from departments such as Theology, History, Government, and Philosophy, have called out Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) for his misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which unjustly harms the poor. In a letter sent prior to Ryan's appearance at Georgetown, the scholars clarify they do not object to his speaking engagement but take issue with his claim that his budget is rooted in Christian values. They join Catholic bishops, theologians, priests, and social justice leaders in condemning Ryan's dismissal of the bishops' critique and his erroneous assertion that their letters did not represent the unified voice of the bishops. The scholars emphasize the devastating consequences of Ryan's budget, including cuts to food programs that prevent starvation among the poor and reductions in Pell Grants that hinder access to education for low-income students. They also correct Ryan's misinterpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," highlighting the importance of higher levels of government providing aid to local communities facing challenges beyond their means, such as economic crises, unemployment, poverty, and hunger. The letter signatories urge Ryan to refer to "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" for a clearer understanding of Catholic social teaching. END OF SUMMARY.
