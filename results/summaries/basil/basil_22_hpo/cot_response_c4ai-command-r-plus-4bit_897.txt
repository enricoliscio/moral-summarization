SUMMARY:
A group of nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators, including over a dozen Jesuit priests and scholars from various departments, have called out Representative Paul Ryan for his misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget. They object to his recent comments claiming that his budget, which includes harmful cuts to programs that support the poor, starving, and students seeking education, is based on Catholic values. The scholars join Catholic bishops in pointing out the devastating impact of these cuts and correcting Ryan's misinterpretation of the concept of "subsidiarity" to justify gutting government programs. They emphasize that while subsidiarity calls for local solutions, it also demands that higher levels of government provide help when communities face challenges beyond their means. The scholars recommended Rep. Ryan read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church," commissioned by the Vatican, to better understand Catholic social doctrine. This incident highlights the moral concerns raised by Rep. Ryan's budget and its potential negative consequences for vulnerable members of society.
