Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Georgetown University faculty criticizing Paul Ryan's budget. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the main points are that nearly 90 Georgetown faculty sent a letter to Ryan before his lecture. They're upset because he used Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they believe hurts the poor. They mention that his budget doesn't align with the teachings, specifically citing the USCCB's stance against disproportionate cuts to services for the poor. 

Ryan dismissed the bishops' critique, claiming they didn't represent all bishops, which the USCCB denied. The faculty also address his misuse of the concept of subsidiarity, explaining it requires higher government involvement when local communities can't handle issues like poverty. They also pointed out the impact on food programs and Pell Grants. 

I should include that the scholars asked Ryan to read the Compendium of Social Doctrine. Also, the letter was signed by various departments, showing a broad academic concern.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary, making sure to cover all key points without exceeding 200 words. I'll start by stating the faculty's action, their objection to Ryan's use of Catholic teachings, reference the bishops' stance, mention Ryan's dismissal, the correction on subsidiarity, and the impact on programs. Finally, note the reading assignment and the signatories.

I should structure it logically, starting with the letter, then the reasons, followed by Ryan's response, the scholars' corrections, and the consequences. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is crucial.

SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) for misusing Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue harms the poor. In a letter sent before Ryan's campus lecture, the scholars objected to his claim that his budget aligns with Catholic teachings, stating it "is nonsense." They referenced the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), which has criticized Ryan's budget for its disproportionate cuts to services for the poor. Ryan had dismissed the bishops' critique, erroneously claiming it didn't represent all bishops. The scholars also corrected Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic principle of subsidiarity, emphasizing that it requires higher government involvement when local communities cannot address issues like poverty. They highlighted the impact of budget cuts on food programs and Pell Grants, which hinder low-income students' access to education. The scholars urged Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" and signed the letter, including Georgetown Jesuit priests and faculty from various departments. END OF SUMMARY.
