SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have called out Representative Paul Ryan for his misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which hurts the poor. In a letter sent to Rep. Ryan ahead of his appearance on campus, the scholars objected to his recent comments claiming his budget is based on Catholic social teaching. They pointed out that his budget has a devastating impact on programs that support the poor, contrary to the teachings of the gospel of compassion and love. The letter quoted the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, who stated that a just budget cannot rely on disproportionate cuts to essential services for the poor. Rep. Ryan dismissed the bishops' critique, but the scholars emphasized that his budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel. They also corrected his misinterpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," arguing that while it calls for local community solutions, it also demands that higher levels of government provide help when communities face challenges beyond their means. The scholars urged Rep. Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church."
