Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. 

The article is about Georgetown University faculty and administrators criticizing Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching in his budget. They sent him a letter before his lecture at their campus. They argue that his budget hurts the poor and doesn't align with Catholic teachings. They mention the bishops' statements against his budget, and how Ryan dismissed their critique. They also talk about specific impacts like cuts to food programs and Pell Grants. They correct Ryan's use of the term "subsidiarity," explaining that it requires higher government help when local communities can't handle issues. They also suggested he read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church."

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key elements: who (Georgetown faculty), what (criticizing Ryan), why (misuse of Catholic teachings, impact on poor), and the main arguments (subsidiarity, bishops' stance, Pell Grants, food programs). Also, mention the letter and the suggested reading.

Let me structure it: Start with the group and their action, then the reasons, followed by the impact and their arguments. Keep it concise, making sure each sentence covers a main point without unnecessary details.

I think I have all the key points. Now, I'll write the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows well.

SUMMARY: Over 80 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misrepresenting Catholic social teaching in his budget, which they argue harms the poor. In a letter to Ryan before his campus lecture, they emphasized that his budget does not align with Catholic teachings, citing the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' opposition to disproportionate cuts in services for the poor. The scholars highlighted the negative impacts of budget cuts on food programs and Pell Grants, which hinder low-income students' access to education. They also corrected Ryan's interpretation of "subsidiarity," explaining that it requires higher government intervention when local communities cannot address issues like poverty and unemployment. The group urged Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to better understand Catholic social teaching. END OF SUMMARY.
