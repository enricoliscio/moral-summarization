Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article is about Georgetown University faculty criticizing Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which hurts the poor. They sent him a letter before his lecture, pointing out that his budget cuts essential services and negatively impacts programs for the poor. They quote the USCCB, which criticized Ryan's budget as failing moral criteria. Ryan dismissed the bishops' critique, which they deny. The scholars argue that Ryan's use of subsidiarity is incorrect and that he's reflecting Ayn Rand's philosophy instead of the gospel's compassion and love. They also mention the impact on food programs and Pell Grants, and they gave him a reading assignment on Catholic social doctrine.

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally framed words: misuse, hurts, comments, claims, based, nonsense, devastating, rely, cuts, services, fails, gospel, compassion, love, use.

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. I'll start by stating the faculty's criticism of Ryan's misuse. Then mention the impact on the poor, the letter sent, the scholars' objection to his claims, the nonsense part, the devastating impact, reliance on cuts, services, the bishops' point about failing moral criteria, Ryan's dismissal, the contrast with Ayn Rand vs. gospel values, the effects on programs, and the correction on subsidiarity.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure all the key points are covered with the moral framing intact. Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is included where it makes sense.

SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators criticized Representative Paul Ryan for his misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which hurts the poor. In a letter sent before his campus lecture, they objected to his claims that his budget is based on Catholic principles, calling his arguments "nonsense." They highlighted the devastating impact of his budget cuts on essential services for the poor, citing the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' criticism that his plan fails moral criteria. Ryan dismissed the bishops' critique, erroneously claiming it didn't represent all bishops. The scholars accused him of reflecting Ayn Rand's philosophy rather than the gospel's compassion and love, emphasizing the need for government support in addressing economic crises. They also addressed the impact of cuts on food programs and Pell Grants, correcting his use of the Catholic concept of subsidiarity. The scholars urged Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church." END OF SUMMARY.
