SUMMARY:

Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have called out Representative Paul Ryan for his misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which hurts the poor. The group argues that Ryan's claims that his budget is based on Catholic social teaching are nonsense. They point out that the budget has a devastating impact on programs for the poor, citing the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' critique that the budget fails to meet moral criteria. The scholars emphasize that the gospel of Jesus Christ promotes compassion and love, not the "survival of the fittest" ideology of Ayn Rand. They correct Ryan's misunderstanding of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," which demands that higher levels of government provide help when local communities face problems beyond their means. The scholars urge Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to understand Catholic social teaching. By speaking out, the Georgetown community upholds the values of compassion, love, and social justice.
