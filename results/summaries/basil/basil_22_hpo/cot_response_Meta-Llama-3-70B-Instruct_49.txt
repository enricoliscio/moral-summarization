SUMMARY:
Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan's misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue has a "devastating impact" on the poor. The scholars, including Jesuit priests and theologians, say Ryan's claims are "nonsense" and that his budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the "gospel of Jesus Christ," which emphasizes "compassion" and "love." They argue that the budget fails to meet "moral criteria" set by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who have called for a "just framework" that does not rely on "disproportionate cuts" to essential services for the poor. The scholars also correct Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," saying it demands that higher levels of government provide help to communities in need. END OF SUMMARY.
