Okay, I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Georgetown University faculty criticizing Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching in his budget. They sent him a letter before his lecture. The main points are that Ryan's budget hurts the poor, the faculty and bishops disagree, and they argue his use of subsidiarity is incorrect.

I should highlight the criticism, the misuse of teachings, and the impact on the poor. Also, mention the letter's purpose and the scholars' corrections on subsidiarity. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral stance is clear.

Let me structure the summary: start with the criticism, mention the misuse, impact on the poor, the letter's purpose, and the correction on subsidiarity. End with the scholars' point about Ryan's values.

I need to make sure it's clear that the scholars oppose Ryan's budget on moral grounds, not his speaking. Also, include the reference to the Compendium as a reading assignment.

Alright, putting it all together in a concise manner.

SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue harms the poor. In a letter sent before Ryan's campus appearance, the scholars emphasized that while they do not object to his speaking, they oppose his claim that his budget aligns with Catholic teachings. They argue that Ryan's budget cuts essential services for the poor, contradicting the moral framework of Catholic social teaching. The scholars cited the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who have condemned the budget as failing moral criteria. Ryan's dismissal of the bishops' critique, as well as his incorrect use of the concept of "subsidiarity," was also addressed. The scholars corrected his interpretation, stating that subsidiarity demands higher levels of government to assist when local communities cannot address systemic issues like poverty and unemployment. They urged Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church," emphasizing that his budget reflects Ayn Rand's philosophy rather than the gospel of compassion. END OF SUMMARY.
