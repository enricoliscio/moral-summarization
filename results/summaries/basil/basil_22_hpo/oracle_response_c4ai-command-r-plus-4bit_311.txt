SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for his misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which hurts the poor. In a letter sent to Rep. Ryan, the scholars objected to his recent comments claiming that his budget is based on Catholic values, calling it "nonsense." They pointed out the devastating impact of cuts in food programs and Pell Grants, which will make it difficult for low-income students to pursue their education. The group also corrected Rep. Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," stating that while it calls for local communities to enact solutions, it also demands that higher levels of government provide help when communities face challenges beyond their means. The scholars recommended that Rep. Ryan read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to better understand Catholic social teaching. Father Thomas J. Reese, one of the organizers of the letter, stated that Rep. Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of compassion and love.
