SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for his misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which hurts the poor. In a letter sent to Rep. Ryan ahead of his appearance at Georgetown, the scholars objected to his recent comments claiming that his budget is based on Catholic values. They pointed out that the budget includes disproportionate cuts to essential services for the poor, contrary to the teachings of the gospel of compassion and love. Father Thomas J. Reese, one of the organizers of the letter, stated that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than those of Jesus Christ. The scholars also corrected Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," explaining that while it calls for local communities to enact solutions, it also demands that higher levels of government provide help when communities face challenges beyond their means. The letter quoted the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, who had previously stated that a just budget framework cannot rely on cuts to services for the poor. The scholars urged Rep. Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to better understand Catholic social teaching.
