Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Georgetown University faculty criticizing Paul Ryan's budget using Catholic social teaching. They sent him a letter before his lecture. They argue his budget hurts the poor and misuses Catholic teachings. They mention the bishops' statements and correct Ryan's use of subsidiarity. They also suggest he read the Compendium. I should capture the main points: who, what, why. Keep it under 200 words, preserve the moral framing. Make sure to include the impact on the poor and the misuse of teachings. Also, mention the scholars' correction on subsidiarity. Okay, let's structure it concisely.

SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) for misusing Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue harms the poor. In a letter to Ryan, the scholars, including Jesuit Father Thomas J. Reese, assert that his budget does not align with Catholic teachings, which emphasize protecting essential services for the poor. They reference the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who have criticized the budget for failing moral criteria. The scholars also correct Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic principle of subsidiarity, explaining that it requires higher levels of government to assist communities during crises, not to gut programs. They urged Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" and emphasized the negative impact of his budget on food programs and Pell Grants for low-income students. The letter highlights the moral obligation to prioritize the poor and reject policies based on ideologies like Ayn Rand's "survival of the fittest." END OF SUMMARY.
