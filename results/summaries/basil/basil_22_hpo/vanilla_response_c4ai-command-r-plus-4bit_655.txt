SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misrepresenting Catholic social teaching to defend his budget proposal, which includes drastic cuts to programs that aid the poor. In a letter sent to Rep. Ryan ahead of his speech at Georgetown, the scholars objected to his claim that his budget is rooted in Catholic values. They cited the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, who have also criticized Ryan's budget for failing to meet moral criteria by disproportionately affecting the poor. Father Thomas J. Reese, one of the organizers of the letter, stated that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ. The scholars also corrected Ryan's misinterpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," highlighting its demand for higher levels of government to provide aid when local communities are unable to address issues like poverty and hunger. The letter, signed by Jesuit priests and scholars from various departments, underscored the devastating impact of cuts to food programs and Pell Grants, and recommended Rep. Ryan read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church."
