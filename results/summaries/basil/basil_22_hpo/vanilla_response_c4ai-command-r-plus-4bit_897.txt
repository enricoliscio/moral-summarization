SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misrepresenting Catholic social teaching to defend his budget proposal, which includes significant cuts to programs that aid the poor. In a letter sent to Rep. Ryan ahead of his appearance at Georgetown, the scholars took issue with his claim that his budget is based on Catholic values. They cited the US Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress, which stated that a just budget framework should not rely on disproportionate cuts to services for the poor. Father Thomas J. Reese, one of the organizers of the letter, noted that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ. The scholars also refuted Ryan's misuse of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," emphasizing that while it calls for local community involvement, it also demands that higher levels of government provide assistance when communities face challenges beyond their means. The signatories, including Jesuit priests and scholars from various departments, urged Rep. Ryan to refer to the "Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" for a better understanding of Catholic social teaching.
