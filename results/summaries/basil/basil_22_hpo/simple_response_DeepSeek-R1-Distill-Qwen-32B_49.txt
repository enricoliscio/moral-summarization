Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author provided. So, first, I'll read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral stance taken.

The article is about Georgetown University faculty criticizing Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching to defend his budget. They sent him a letter before his lecture at their Catholic campus. The main issue is that Ryan's budget hurts the poor, and the scholars argue that his use of Catholic teachings is incorrect.

I should highlight that the scholars are not against Ryan speaking but his misuse of the teachings. They reference the bishops' statements against the budget, pointing out its negative impact on programs for the poor. They also correct Ryan's understanding of subsidiarity, explaining that it requires higher government involvement when local communities can't handle issues.

Additionally, the scholars provided a reading assignment for Ryan, which adds to their critique. I need to make sure the summary includes these points without going over 200 words. I'll structure it to first introduce the criticism, then explain the reasons and their arguments, keeping the moral perspective clear.

SUMMARY: Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue harms the poor. In a letter to Ryan, they objected to his claim that his budget aligns with Catholic teachings, stating it is "nonsense" and that his policies have a devastating impact on programs for the poor. The scholars cited the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who have criticized Ryan's budget for failing to meet moral criteria, particularly in cutting essential services for the poor. Ryan had dismissed the bishops' critique, incorrectly claiming it did not represent all bishops. The Georgetown scholars also corrected Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic principle of subsidiarity, arguing it requires higher levels of government to assist local communities when they cannot address issues like poverty and unemployment on their own. The scholars urged Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to better understand Catholic social teaching. END OF SUMMARY.
