SUMMARY:

Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan's misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue hurts the poor. The group, including Jesuit priests and scholars from various departments, sent a letter to Ryan ahead of his appearance on campus, objecting to his claim that his budget is based on Catholic principles. They argue that Ryan's budget has a "devastating impact" on programs for the poor, citing the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' criticism of the budget. The scholars accuse Ryan of promoting a "survival of the fittest" philosophy, rather than the gospel of compassion and love. They correct Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," emphasizing that it demands government support for communities in need. The scholars urge Ryan to read the "Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to understand Catholic social teaching. By speaking out, the Georgetown community upholds the moral values of compassion, justice, and care for the poor.
