SUMMARY:
Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) for his misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which hurts the poor. In a letter sent to Rep. Ryan, the scholars express their objection to his recent comments defending his budget on Christian grounds. They highlight the devastating impact of cuts in programs for the poor, including food assistance and education. The letter also corrects Rep. Ryan's misuse of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," stating that while it calls for solutions to be enacted at the local level, it also demands that higher levels of government provide help when communities face challenges beyond their means. The scholars emphasize the moral imperative of compassion and love, contrasting it with Social Darwinism. They urge Rep. Ryan to refer to the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church for a proper understanding of Catholic social teaching. Father Thomas J. Reese, one of the organizers of the letter, dismisses Rep. Ryan's budget as reflecting the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ. The letter joins a chorus of Catholic bishops, theologians, priests, and social justice leaders who have spoken out against Rep. Ryan's misuse of Catholic social teaching to justify his budget.
