SUMMARY:

Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan's budget, claiming it misuses Catholic social teaching to justify cuts that harm the poor. In a letter, they argue that Ryan's budget contradicts Catholic values, citing the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' criticism of the budget's "devastating impact" on programs for the poor. The scholars, including Jesuit priests and theologians, say Ryan's budget reflects the values of philosopher Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ. They correct Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," which they say demands government help in times of crisis. The letter's organizers, including Jesuit Father Thomas J. Reese, urge Ryan to reconsider his budget and recommend reading "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church." The scholars emphasize that they are not objecting to Ryan's speaking on campus, but rather his misuse of Catholic teaching to justify harmful policies.
