Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Georgetown University faculty criticizing Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching in his budget. They sent a letter to him, emphasizing that his budget hurts the poor and misrepresents Catholic teachings.

I should identify the key points: the faculty's criticism, the misuse of teachings, the impact on the poor, and the specific moral terms used. I need to make sure to include words like "misuse," "hurts," "devastating," "compassion," etc., as per the user's request.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the faculty's stance, their reasons, and the moral arguments they presented. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the necessary moral elements and key points without losing the essence of the article.

SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for his misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue hurts the poor. In a letter to Ryan, they objected to his claims that his budget is based on Catholic social teaching, calling it "nonsense." They emphasized that his budget has a devastating impact on programs for the poor, citing the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who warned against disproportionate cuts to essential services for vulnerable populations. The scholars also corrected Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic principle of subsidiarity, explaining that it requires higher levels of government to provide support when local communities cannot address severe issues like poverty and unemployment. They urged Ryan to align his policies with the gospel of compassion and love, rather than the values of Ayn Rand. The letter, signed by Georgetown Jesuit priests and scholars from various departments, included a reading assignment for Ryan: "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church." END OF SUMMARY.
