Okay, I need to summarize this news article. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. So, I should focus on the key points related to the moral arguments made against Paul Ryan's budget.

First, the article is about Georgetown faculty criticizing Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching in his budget. They sent a letter to him before his lecture at their Catholic campus. The main issue is that Ryan claims his budget is based on Catholic teachings, but they argue it's not.

They mention the impact on the poor, like cuts to food programs and Pell Grants. The scholars also correct Ryan's use of "subsidiarity," explaining it requires higher government help when local communities can't handle issues like poverty.

I should include the scholars' point that Ryan's budget reflects Ayn Rand's philosophy instead of the gospel. Also, the USCCB's stance against the budget and Ryan's dismissal of their critique.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens. Make sure to highlight the moral arguments against Ryan's budget using Catholic teachings.

SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) for misusing Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue harms the poor. In a letter sent before Ryan's campus lecture, the scholars, including Jesuit Father Thomas J. Reese, argue that Ryan's claims about his budget aligning with Catholic teachings are "nonsense." They cite the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who have condemned the budget for its disproportionate cuts to programs aiding the poor. Ryan dismissed the bishops' critique, claiming it didn't represent all bishops, a claim the USCCB denied. The scholars also corrected Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic principle of "subsidiarity," emphasizing that it requires higher government support when local communities cannot address issues like poverty and unemployment. They urged Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church," stressing that his budget reflects Ayn Rand's philosophy rather than the gospel of compassion. END OF SUMMARY.
