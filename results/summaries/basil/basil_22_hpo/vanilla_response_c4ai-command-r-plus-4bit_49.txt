SUMMARY: Nearly 90 faculty and administrators from Georgetown University have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misrepresenting Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which disproportionately harms the poor. In a letter sent ahead of Ryan's lecture at the Catholic campus, the scholars objected to his recent comments justifying his budget with Christian values. They cited the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, who stated that a just budget framework should not rely on cuts to programs for the poor, contrary to Ryan's claims. Father Thomas J. Reese, one of the organizers of the letter, stated that Ryan's budget reflects Ayn Rand's values rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ. The scholars highlighted the detrimental impact of cuts to food programs and Pell Grants, which help low-income students access education. They also corrected Ryan's misinterpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," emphasizing that higher levels of government are expected to provide aid when local communities face challenges beyond their means. The letter was signed by Georgetown Jesuit priests and scholars from various departments.
END OF SUMMARY.
