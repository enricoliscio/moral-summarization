SUMMARY:

Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have called out Representative Paul Ryan for his misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which hurts the poor. The group, including Jesuit priests and scholars from various departments, sent a letter to Ryan criticizing his comments that claimed his budget was based on Catholic principles. They argue that this is nonsense, as his budget has a devastating impact on programs for the poor, relying on disproportionate cuts in essential services. The scholars point out that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ, which emphasizes compassion and love. They correct Ryan's use of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," stating that it demands higher levels of government provide help when communities face problems beyond their means. The scholars urge Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to understand Catholic social teaching. By defending his budget with flawed Catholic principles, Ryan fails to meet the moral criteria set by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.
