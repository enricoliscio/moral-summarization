SUMMARY:
Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue has a "devastating impact" on the poor. The scholars, including Jesuit priests, theologians, and social justice leaders, claim that Ryan's budget is not based on Catholic values, but rather on the philosophy of Ayn Rand. They argue that the budget fails to meet "moral criteria" and does not reflect the "gospel of Jesus Christ," which is one of "compassion and love." The scholars point to the "difficult" consequences of cuts in food programs and Pell Grants, and correct Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity." They urge Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to better understand Catholic social teaching. END OF SUMMARY.
