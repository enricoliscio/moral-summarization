SUMMARY:
Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan's misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which has a "devastating impact" on the poor. The scholars argue that Ryan's budget fails to meet "moral criteria" and instead reflects the values of Ayn Rand, prioritizing "survival of the fittest" over the "gospel of compassion and love." The group points out that Ryan's budget would cut essential services, including food programs that prevent starvation, and Pell Grants that help low-income students pursue their education. The scholars correct Ryan's interpretation of "subsidiarity," emphasizing that it demands higher levels of government provide help when local communities face problems beyond their means. The letter concludes by assigning Ryan a reading assignment: "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church." END OF SUMMARY.
