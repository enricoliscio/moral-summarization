Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Georgetown University faculty criticizing Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching in his budget. The key points are that they sent a letter, they're not against him speaking but his misuse of teachings, the impact on the poor, the mention of the bishops' statements, the critique of Ryan's dismissal, and the correction on subsidiarity.

I should include the morally charged words like misuse, hurts, claims, nonsense, devastating, compassion, love, use. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes these terms. I'll structure it by stating the main action (faculty criticizing Ryan), the reasons (misuse of teachings, impact on poor), and the specific points they made (subsidiarity, budget impact, recommendations). I'll also mention the scholars' background and their request for reading material.

SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for his misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue hurts the poor. In a letter to Ryan, the scholars, including Jesuit Father Thomas J. Reese, accused him of claiming his budget is based on Catholic social teaching, calling this "nonsense." They highlighted the devastating impact of his budget on programs for the poor, such as food assistance and Pell Grants, and criticized his reliance on cuts to essential services. The scholars emphasized that Catholic social teaching demands compassion and love, not the values of Ayn Rand or Social Darwinism. They also corrected Ryan's use of the concept of subsidiarity, explaining it requires higher levels of government to provide help when local communities cannot address issues like poverty and unemployment. The scholars urged Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to better understand Catholic teachings. END OF SUMMARY.
