SUMMARY:

Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators, including Jesuit priests and theologians, have criticized Representative Paul Ryan's misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue hurts the poor. The group sent a letter to Ryan, stating that his budget contradicts Catholic values of compassion and love, and instead reflects the philosophy of Ayn Rand. They pointed out that the US Conference of Catholic Bishops has repeatedly stated that the budget fails to meet moral criteria, particularly in its disproportionate cuts to essential services for the poor. The scholars also corrected Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," emphasizing that it demands higher levels of government provide help to local communities in times of need. By defending his budget on Christian grounds, Ryan is misrepresenting Catholic social teaching, and the scholars urged him to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to understand the true principles of Catholicism.
