SUMMARY:
Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan's misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they claim has a "devastating impact" on programs for the poor. The scholars argue that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the "gospel of Jesus Christ," emphasizing "survival of the fittest" over "compassion and love." They correct Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," stating that it demands higher levels of government provide help in times of "crises," "unemployment," "poverty," and "hunger." The scholars urge Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to better understand Catholic social teaching. By defending his budget on Christian grounds, Ryan is perpetuating "nonsense" that goes against the "moral criteria" set by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. END OF SUMMARY.
