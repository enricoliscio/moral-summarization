Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Georgetown faculty criticizing Paul Ryan's budget using Catholic social teaching. The key points are that they sent a letter, they're not against him speaking, but they object to his misuse of Catholic teachings. They mention the impact on the poor, the bishops' stance, and the concept of subsidiarity. I should include the morally framed words like misuse, hurts, devastating, compassion, etc. I'll make sure to highlight the scholars' arguments against Ryan's budget and his misuse of teachings. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it to include all these elements clearly.

SUMMARY: Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) for his misuse of Catholic social teaching in defending his budget, which they argue hurts the poor. In a letter to Ryan, they objected to his claims that his budget is based on Catholic social teaching, calling his assertions "nonsense." They highlighted the devastating impact of his proposed cuts on programs for the poor, including food programs and Pell Grants. The scholars emphasized that Catholic social teaching demands compassion and love, not the "survival of the fittest" philosophy they associate with Ryan's budget. They also corrected Ryan's use of the concept of "subsidiarity," explaining that it requires higher levels of government to provide support when local communities cannot address significant issues like poverty and unemployment. The scholars urged Ryan to read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church" to better understand Catholic social teaching. END OF SUMMARY.
