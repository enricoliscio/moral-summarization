SUMMARY:

Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan's (R-Wisc.) budget, accusing him of misusing Catholic social teaching to defend his proposals that harm the poor. In a letter, the scholars argue that Ryan's budget contradicts Catholic values, citing the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' criticism of the budget's disproportionate cuts to essential services for the poor. The scholars also correct Ryan's interpretation of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," which they say demands higher levels of government provide help to local communities in need. The letter was sent ahead of Ryan's appearance on the Catholic campus to give the Whittington Lecture. The scholars, including over a dozen Georgetown Jesuit priests, urge Ryan to reconsider his budget in light of Catholic social teaching, recommending he read "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church."
