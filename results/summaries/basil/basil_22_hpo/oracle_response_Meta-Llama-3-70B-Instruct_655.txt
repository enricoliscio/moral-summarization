SUMMARY:

Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have called out Representative Paul Ryan for his misuse of Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which hurts the poor. The group sent a letter to Ryan, stating that his claims of basing his budget on Catholic social teaching are "nonsense." They argue that his budget has a devastating impact on programs for the poor, citing the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' critique that the budget fails to meet moral criteria. The scholars point out that Ryan's budget reflects the values of Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ, which emphasizes compassion and love. They correct Ryan's use of the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity," stating that it demands higher levels of government provide help when local communities face problems beyond their means. The scholars assign Ryan a reading assignment: "The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church." By signing the letter, they stand against Ryan's harmful policies and uphold the values of Catholic social teaching.
