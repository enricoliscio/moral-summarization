SUMMARY:
Nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have criticized Representative Paul Ryan for misusing Catholic social teaching to defend his budget, which they argue has a "devastating impact" on programs for the poor. The scholars, including Jesuit priests and theologians, claim that Ryan's budget is not based on Catholic social teaching, but rather on the values of philosopher Ayn Rand. They argue that the budget fails to meet "moral criteria" and instead promotes a "survival of the fittest" mentality. The scholars point to the "devastating" cuts in food programs and Pell Grants, which will make it "difficult" for low-income students to pursue their educations. They call on Ryan to reconsider his budget, citing the Catholic concept of "subsidiarity" and the "gospel of compassion and love." END OF SUMMARY.
