SUMMARY: Newsweek magazine's recent cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy among conservatives and unlikely allies alike. The photo depicts Bachmann with wide eyes, focused intensely above the camera, and has been criticized as sexist and disrespectful. The cover, accompanied by the title "The Queen of Rage," has drawn comparisons to a previous Newsweek cover featuring Sarah Palin in running shorts, which was also deemed sexist. In response to the backlash, Newsweek released additional photos from the photoshoot, all showcasing Bachmann with the same wide-eyed intensity. The article itself, however, has generated little outrage, focusing on Bachmann's place in the Tea Party movement and on the national stage. This incident adds to Newsweek's history of controversial covers, including one featuring Princess Diana's ghost alongside the Duchess of Cambridge.
END OF SUMMARY.
