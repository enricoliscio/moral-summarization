SUMMARY:

Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its latest cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, dubbed "The Queen of Rage." The image shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed gaze, prompting criticism from conservatives and liberals alike. Many argue that the photo is sexist and biased against conservatives, with some pointing out that a similar image would never be used for a male politician. The National Organization for Women's president, Terry O'Neill, condemned the cover as sexist, citing Gloria Steinem's test: would this image be used for a man? Newsweek responded by posting outtakes from the photo shoot, showcasing Bachmann's intensity in various settings. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its cover choices, having previously been criticized for sexist images of Sarah Palin and a creepy, computer-generated image of Princess Diana. The controversy highlights the media's power to shape public perception and the importance of fair representation.
