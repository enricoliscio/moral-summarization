SUMMARY:

Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its latest cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, dubbed "The Queen of Rage". The image shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed stare, which many in the conservative blogosphere have deemed disrespectful and biased against conservatives. Even some unlikely allies, such as the president of the National Organization for Women, Terry O'Neill, have criticized the cover as sexist, arguing that a similar image would never be used for a male politician. Newsweek has responded by posting additional photos from the shoot, showcasing Bachmann's intensity in various settings. This is not the first time Newsweek has caused a stir with its cover choices, having previously published controversial images of Sarah Palin and a computer-generated image of Princess Diana.
