SUMMARY: Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its cover photo of Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, labeling her "The Queen of Rage." The image, which depicts Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed stare, has been criticized by many in the conservative blogosphere as "disrespectful" and "biased" against conservatives. Some have even gone so far as to call it "sexist," arguing that a similar photo would never be used to portray a male politician. The National Organization for Women's president, Terry O'Neill, has also weighed in, saying the cover is "sexist" and would never be done to a man. Newsweek has responded to the backlash by posting additional photos from the shoot, showcasing Bachmann in more mundane settings. This is not the first time the magazine has caused a stir with its cover choices, having previously published "sexist" and "creepy" images of Sarah Palin and Princess Diana. END OF SUMMARY.
