Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. The article is about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann, and the ensuing controversy. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the cover has Bachmann with wide eyes and the caption "The Queen of Rage." Conservatives are upset, calling it disrespectful and biased. Some even question the media's bias against conservatives. Interestingly, even Terry O’Neill from NOW, a women's group, criticized it as sexist, using Gloria Steinem's test about whether this would be done to a man.

Newsweek responded by showing outtakes, which included Bachmann in more normal settings but still with the same intense expression. The article itself didn't cause much outrage, but the cover did. The article is by Lois Romano about Bachmann's role in the Tea Party.

I remember that Newsweek has had similar controversies before, like with Sarah Palin and the Duchess of Cambridge. These past issues are relevant to show a pattern of problematic cover choices.

So, the summary needs to capture the main points: the cover image, the reactions from conservatives and feminists, Newsweek's response, and the context of previous controversies. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

I need to make sure to include the key elements without getting bogged down in details. Also, the user specified to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." So, I'll structure it that way.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and covers all important aspects. I'll check for clarity and conciseness, making sure each sentence adds value without redundancy.

SUMMARY:  
Newsweek's recent cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy. The image, with Bachmann's wide eyes and the caption "The Queen of Rage," has drawn criticism from conservatives, who accuse the magazine of bias and disrespect. Some, including Terry O’Neill of the National Organization for Women, argue the cover is sexist, noting such treatment would not be applied to a male candidate. Newsweek responded by posting outtakes of Bachmann, showing her in more neutral settings but retaining the intense expression. The article accompanying the cover, by Lois Romano, focuses on Bachmann's role in the Tea Party movement and has not caused significant outrage. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its cover choices, with past controversies including photos of Sarah Palin and Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.  

END OF SUMMARY.
