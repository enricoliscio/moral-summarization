SUMMARY:
Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its latest cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, dubbed "The Queen of Rage." The image shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed stare, which many in the conservative blogosphere have deemed "crazy" and "biased" against conservatives. Even some unlikely allies, such as the National Organization for Women, have criticized the cover as "sexist" and "disrespectful." The magazine's response, posting "outtakes" of Bachmann in more mundane settings, has done little to quell the outrage. This is not Newsweek's first foray into controversy, having previously published "sexist" and "creepy" covers featuring Sarah Palin and a computer-generated image of Princess Diana. The article itself, which explores Bachmann's place in the Tea Party movement, has generated little backlash. END OF SUMMARY.
