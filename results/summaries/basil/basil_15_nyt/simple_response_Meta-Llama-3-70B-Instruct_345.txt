SUMMARY:

Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its latest cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, dubbed "The Queen of Rage." The image shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed stare, prompting criticism from both conservative and liberal circles. Many have accused Newsweek of bias and sexism, with some arguing that a similar portrayal would never be done to a male politician. The National Organization for Women's president, Terry O'Neill, has condemned the cover as sexist, citing Gloria Steinem's test: "If this were done to a man or would it ever be done to a man?" Newsweek has responded by releasing additional photos from the shoot, showcasing Bachmann in more mundane settings, but the damage has already been done. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its cover choices, having previously been criticized for sexist and creepy images of Sarah Palin and Princess Diana. The incident raises questions about media bias and the objectification of female politicians.
