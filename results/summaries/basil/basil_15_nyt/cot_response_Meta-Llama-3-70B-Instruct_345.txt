SUMMARY:
Newsweek magazine's latest cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy, with many in the conservative blogosphere calling it "biased" and "disrespectful". The cover photo shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed stare, which some have likened to making her look "crazy". Even unlikely allies, such as the National Organization for Women, have deemed the cover "sexist", arguing that a similar photo would never be used for a male candidate. This is not the first time Newsweek has caused a stir with its cover choices, having previously published a photo of Sarah Palin in running shorts that was also labeled "sexist", and a computer-generated image of Princess Diana that was dubbed "creepy". The article itself, which explores Bachmann's place in the Tea Party movement, has sparked little "outrage" compared to the cover photo. END OF SUMMARY.
