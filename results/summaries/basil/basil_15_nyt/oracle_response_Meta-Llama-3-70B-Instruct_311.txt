SUMMARY:

Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its latest cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, dubbed "The Queen of Rage." The image shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed stare, prompting many in the conservative blogosphere to cry foul, accusing the magazine of being biased against conservatives. Critics argue that the photo makes Bachmann look "crazy" and is "disrespectful" to a sitting congresswoman and presidential candidate. Even unlikely allies, such as the president of the National Organization for Women, Terry O'Neill, have condemned the cover as "sexist," suggesting that a similar photo would never be taken of a man. Newsweek has responded by posting additional photos from the shoot, showcasing Bachmann's intensity in various settings. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash over its cover choices, having previously been accused of sexism with a photo of Sarah Palin and creepiness with a computer-generated image of Princess Diana.
