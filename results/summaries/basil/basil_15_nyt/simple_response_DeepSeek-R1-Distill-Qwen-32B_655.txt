Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided the article about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann, which caused a stir in the conservative blogosphere and beyond.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main issue is the cover image of Bachmann with wide eyes, labeled "The Queen of Rage." Conservatives and even some feminists are upset, calling it sexist. Newsweek defended themselves by showing other photos from the shoot, but the article itself didn't cause much controversy. There's also context about Newsweek's past controversial covers, like Sarah Palin and Princess Diana.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. The moral framing is important, so I should highlight the criticism regarding bias and sexism. I'll mention the conservative reaction, the feminist critique, and Newsweek's response. I'll also include the historical context of their past covers to show a pattern.

I'll structure the summary to start with the cover image and the backlash, then move to the responses from different groups, and end with Newsweek's reaction and the comparison to past issues. I need to keep it concise, making sure each point is clear without going into too much detail.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented in the article. Also, ensure that the moral implications are clear, like the sexism charge and the bias against conservatives. I'll make sure the summary flows logically, each sentence building on the previous one.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the cover and the reaction, then the conservative and feminist criticisms, Newsweek's response, and the historical context. Keep each part brief but informative. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together in a coherent summary.

SUMMARY:  
This week's Newsweek magazine features a cover image of Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, labeled "The Queen of Rage," with an intense, wide-eyed expression. The conservative blogosphere has criticized the cover as disrespectful and biased, with some calling it sexist. Critics argue that such imagery would not be used for a male candidate. Even Terry Oâ€™Neill of the National Organization for Women criticized the cover, questioning its appropriateness and comparing it to past sexist portrayals of female politicians. Newsweek defended itself by publishing additional photos from the shoot, showing Bachmann in more neutral settings, but the cover remains controversial. The article accompanying the cover, by Lois Romano, has not sparked significant outrage. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced criticism for its cover choices, including past controversies over Sarah Palin and Princess Diana.  

END OF SUMMARY.
