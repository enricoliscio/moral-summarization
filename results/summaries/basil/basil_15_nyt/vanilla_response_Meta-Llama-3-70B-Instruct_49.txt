SUMMARY:

Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its latest cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann. The cover photo shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed expression, accompanied by the headline "The Queen of Rage." Many conservatives have criticized the cover, calling it biased and disrespectful. Even some unlikely allies, such as the president of the National Organization for Women, have labeled the cover as sexist. Newsweek responded to the backlash by posting an "outtakes" gallery, showcasing other photos taken for the article. The controversy is not new for Newsweek, which has faced criticism for past cover choices, including a photo of Sarah Palin in running shorts and a computer-generated image of Princess Diana. The article itself, which explores Bachmann's place in the Tea Party movement, has generated little outrage.
