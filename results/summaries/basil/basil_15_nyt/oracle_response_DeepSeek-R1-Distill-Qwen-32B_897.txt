Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've given me the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann, which caused controversy. The cover image makes her look intense, and the caption is "The Queen of Rage." Conservatives and some feminists criticized the cover as biased, disrespectful, and sexist. Newsweek responded by showing other photos, but the article itself didn't cause much outrage. They also mentioned past controversial covers, like Sarah Palin and Princess Diana.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words used: puts, crazy, biased, disrespectful, sexist, done, creepy. I should make sure these are included in the summary.

I'll start by mentioning the cover and the caption. Then, note the reactions from conservatives and Terry O’Neill’s comment about sexism. I should include the words 'puts,' 'crazy,' 'biased,' 'disrespectful,''sexist.' Also, mention the response from Newsweek and the past covers, using 'done' and 'creepy.'

I need to keep it concise, so I'll structure the summary to cover all these points without going over 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral word is included naturally.

Wait, the user also provided an example response. I should check that to see how they incorporated the words. They used "puts," "crazy," "biased," "disrespectful," "sexist," "done," and "creepy." I need to make sure my summary does the same.

I'll start by introducing the cover, then the reactions, the feminist critique, Newsweek's response, and the historical context. I'll make sure each section includes the necessary moral terms without forcing them in.

Alright, putting it all together, ensuring each key point is covered and the moral words are present. I'll aim for clarity and conciseness, making sure the summary flows well and stays under the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Newsweek's cover featuring Republican candidate Michele Bachmann with the caption "The Queen of Rage" has sparked controversy. Critics, including conservative bloggers and feminist Terry O’Neill, argue the image is disrespectful and sexist, comparing it to how men would never be portrayed similarly. The conservative blogosphere accuses the media of bias against conservatives. Newsweek defended itself by publishing outtakes, but the cover’s intense depiction of Bachmann, with wide eyes, remains controversial. This isn’t the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its covers, including a 2009 photo of Sarah Palin and a 2011 image of Princess Diana’s ghost. The article accompanying Bachmann’s cover, however, has not drawn significant outrage. The controversy highlights ongoing debates about media bias and respectful representation. END OF SUMMARY.
