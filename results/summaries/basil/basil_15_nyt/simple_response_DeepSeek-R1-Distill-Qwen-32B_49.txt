Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand what's happening.

The article is about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann, a Republican candidate and Tea Party favorite. The cover has her with wide eyes, looking intense, and the caption is "The Queen of Rage." There's a lot of backlash from conservatives, like Noel Sheppard and bloggers, who think the image is biased and makes her look crazy. Even Terry O’Neill from NOW is calling it sexist, using Gloria Steinem's test about whether this would ever be done to a man.

Newsweek responded by showing outtakes, which include Bachmann shaking hands and signing autographs, all with the same intense look. The article itself didn't cause much outrage, but the cover did. The article mentions that Newsweek has had similar issues before, like with Sarah Palin and Princess Diana.

So, the main points are: the cover image, the backlash from conservatives and feminists, the response from Newsweek, and past controversies.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral framing—how different groups view the cover as biased or sexist. I should keep it under 200 words and end with the tokens as instructed.

Let me structure it: start with the cover and its caption, mention the backlash from conservatives and feminists, Newsweek's response, and the context of past issues. Make sure to highlight the moral aspects each group is emphasizing.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, let me put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: Newsweek's cover featuring Republican candidate Michele Bachmann, titled "The Queen of Rage," sparked controversy. Conservatives criticized the image, calling it biased and making Bachmann appear "crazy." Feminists, including Terry O’Neill of NOW, condemned it as sexist, questioning if such treatment would ever be applied to a male candidate. Newsweek defended itself by releasing outtakes showing Bachmann in more neutral settings but with the same intense expression. The article accompanying the cover, focusing on Bachmann's role in the Tea Party movement, drew little outrage, but the cover itself reignited debates about media bias and sexism. This isn't the first time Newsweek has faced criticism for controversial covers, with past examples including Sarah Palin and Princess Diana. END OF SUMMARY.
