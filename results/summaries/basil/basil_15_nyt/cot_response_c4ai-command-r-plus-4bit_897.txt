SUMMARY:
Newsweek's recent cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked outrage among conservatives and unlikely allies alike. The image, depicting Bachmann with wide-eyed intensity and labeled "The Queen of Rage," has been criticized as disrespectful and sexist. Many believe the photo intentionally makes Bachmann look crazy and question the media's bias against conservatives. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced controversy over its cover choices, with previous covers featuring Sarah Palin and Princess Diana also sparking outrage and accusations of sexism. The magazine responded by releasing additional photos from the Bachmann photoshoot, but the damage was done, and the incident adds to a growing list of controversial cover choices by the publication.
