SUMMARY:

Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its latest cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, dubbed "The Queen of Rage." The image shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed stare, which many in the conservative blogosphere have deemed "crazy" and "biased." Even some unlikely allies, such as the president of the National Organization for Women, Terry O'Neill, have condemned the cover as "sexist" and "disrespectful," arguing that it would never be done to a man. Newsweek responded to the backlash by posting an "outtakes" gallery, showcasing other photos of Bachmann, but the damage was already done. This is not the first time Newsweek has caused a stir with its cover choices, having previously been accused of sexism with a photo of Sarah Palin and creepiness with a computer-generated image of Princess Diana. The magazine's editors have been called out for their questionable decisions, leading many to question their judgment and motives.

END OF SUMMARY.
