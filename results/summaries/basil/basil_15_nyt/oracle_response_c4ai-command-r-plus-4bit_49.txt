SUMMARY: Newsweek magazine caused controversy by choosing a photo of Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann that made her look crazy for its cover. The photo, which depicted Bachmann with her eyes wide open and focused intensely off in the distance, was criticized by both conservatives and unlikely allies like the National Organization for Women as disrespectful and sexist. This is not the first time Newsweek has been accused of biased cover choices, having previously featured a photo of Sarah Palin in running shorts and a computer-generated image of Princess Diana's ghost. The magazine responded to the backlash by releasing other photos from the Bachmann photoshoot, all of which depicted the same wide-eyed intensity. The controversy surrounding the cover overshadowed the accompanying article, which spawned little outrage. The incident highlights the ongoing debate about the media's biased and disrespectful portrayal of conservative women in politics. END OF SUMMARY.
