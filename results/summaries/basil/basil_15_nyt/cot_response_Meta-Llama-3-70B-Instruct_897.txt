SUMMARY:
Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its latest cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, dubbed "The Queen of Rage". The cover photo, which shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed stare, has been criticized by conservatives and liberals alike, with some calling it "disrespectful" and "sexist". Even the National Organization for Women's president, Terry O'Neill, has weighed in, saying the cover would never be done to a man. Newsweek has responded by posting additional photos of Bachmann, showcasing her interacting with voters and signing autographs with the same intensity. This is not the first time Newsweek has caused a stir with its cover choices, having previously been accused of sexism with a photo of Sarah Palin and creepiness with a computer-generated image of Princess Diana. The backlash has raised questions about the magazine's bias against conservatives. END OF SUMMARY.
