The conservative blogosphere has criticized the image, with some arguing that it intentionally makes Bachmann look crazy and questioning the media's bias against conservatives. Even the National Organization for Women has spoken out against the cover, asserting that such a portrayal would never be done to a man. Newsweek's decision to use this photo, along with past controversial cover choices, raises questions about the ethical boundaries of newsmagazine editorial decisions and their potential impact on public perception of female political figures.
