SUMMARY: Newsweek magazine has caused controversy once again with its choice of cover image, this time featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann. The photo, which depicts Bachmann with her eyes wide open and focused intensely off in the distance, has been criticized by many in the conservative blogosphere as disrespectful and biased. The cover has sparked outrage, with some arguing that it makes Bachmann "look crazy" and that such a portrayal would never be done to a man. Even the president of the National Organization for Women, Terry O'Neill, called the image sexist. This is not the first time Newsweek has been accused of biased and sexist cover choices, having previously featured Sarah Palin in running shorts and a computer-generated image of Princess Diana's ghost. The magazine responded to the backlash by releasing additional photos from the Bachmann photoshoot, but the damage had already been done, and the controversy continues to rage. END OF SUMMARY.
