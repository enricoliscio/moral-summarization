SUMMARY:

Newsweek magazine's recent cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy. The cover photo shows Bachmann with a wide-eyed, intense gaze, which some have deemed "crazy" or "sexist." Critics argue that the image is disrespectful and biased against conservatives. Even the National Organization for Women's president, Terry O'Neill, has spoken out against the cover, suggesting that a similar image would never be used for a male politician. In response to the backlash, Newsweek posted additional photos from the shoot, showcasing Bachmann in various settings, all with a similar intense expression. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced criticism for its cover choices, having previously been accused of sexism for a photo of Sarah Palin in running shorts and creepiness for a computer-generated image of Princess Diana. The article accompanying the Bachmann cover photo has received little attention, focusing on her role in the Tea Party movement and national politics.
