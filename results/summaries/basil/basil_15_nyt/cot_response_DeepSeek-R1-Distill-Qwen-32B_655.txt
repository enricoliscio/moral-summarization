Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points. 

The article is about Newsweek putting Michele Bachmann on their cover with a photo that makes her look intense and possibly "crazy." The cover has "The Queen of Rage" across her torso. Conservatives are upset, calling it biased. Some even question the media's bias against conservatives. Terry Oâ€™Neill from NOW says it's sexist, comparing it to how a man wouldn't be portrayed that way. Newsweek responded by showing outtakes, which also have her intense look. The article itself isn't causing much outrage, but the cover is. They also mention past controversial covers, like Sarah Palin and the Duchess of Cambridge with Princess Diana.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words. Looking through the article, words like "disrespectful," "sexist," "biased," "crazy," "ghost," and "outrage" stand out. These words carry moral judgments or criticisms.

For the summary, I need to include these words and keep it under 200 words. I should start by stating the controversy, mention the conservatives' reaction, the sexism claim, the outtakes, and the past covers as context. I'll make sure to include all the key moral terms without making the summary too long.

Let me structure it: Start with the cover and the reaction, then the sexism angle, Newsweek's response, and mention the previous controversial covers to show a pattern. I'll make sure to use the identified moral words naturally in the summary.

* Outrage

**SUMMARY:**
Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann with the caption "The Queen of Rage" sparked controversy, with conservatives calling it disrespectful and biased. Critics argue the portrayal is sexist, noting such imagery would never be used for a male candidate. Newsweek defended the cover by sharing outtakes, which also depicted Bachmann with the same intense expression. The article itself, discussing her role in the Tea Party movement, did not cause significant outrage. This incident follows previous controversial covers, such as one of Sarah Palin and another featuring Princess Diana's ghost. END OF SUMMARY.
