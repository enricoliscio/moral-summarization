Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann, which has caused some controversy. 

First, the cover has a picture of Bachmann with wide eyes, and the text "The Queen of Rage" across her torso. Conservatives are upset, feeling it's biased. They question why they would put such a photo of a congresswoman and presidential candidate. Some even think the media is biased against conservatives. 

Interestingly, Terry O’Neill from NOW calls it sexist, using Gloria Steinem's test—asking if this would ever be done to a man. That's a good point to include.

Newsweek responded by posting outtakes showing Bachmann in other settings, but the article itself didn't cause much outrage. The article is by Lois Romano about Bachmann's role in the Tea Party. 

I should mention that Newsweek has had similar controversies before, like with Sarah Palin and Princess Diana. This shows a pattern of controversial cover choices.

So, the summary should cover the cover image, the reactions from conservatives and NOW, the response from Newsweek, and the context of their past controversial covers. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well.
