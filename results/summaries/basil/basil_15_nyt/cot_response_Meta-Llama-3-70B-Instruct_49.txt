SUMMARY:
Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, dubbed "The Queen of Rage." The image, which shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed gaze, has been criticized by many in the conservative blogosphere as "biased" and "disrespectful." Even some unlikely allies, such as the president of the National Organization for Women, Terry O'Neill, have condemned the cover as "sexist," arguing that a similar image would never be used for a male politician. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its cover choices, having previously published images of Sarah Palin and a computer-generated image of Princess Diana that were deemed "sexist" and "creepy," respectively. The article itself, which explores Bachmann's place in the Tea Party movement, has generated little outrage. END OF SUMMARY.
