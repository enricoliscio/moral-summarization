SUMMARY:

Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its latest cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed expression. The cover, accompanied by the headline "The Queen of Rage," has drawn criticism from conservatives, who claim it makes Bachmann look "crazy." Even some unlikely allies, such as the National Organization for Women, have condemned the cover as "sexist." Newsweek responded by posting an "outtakes" gallery showcasing other photos taken for the article, which show Bachmann in various settings with the same intense expression. This is not the first time Newsweek has caused a stir with its cover choices, having previously published a photo of Sarah Palin in running shorts and a computer-generated image of Princess Diana alongside Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge. The article itself, which explores Bachmann's place in the Tea Party movement, has generated little outrage.
