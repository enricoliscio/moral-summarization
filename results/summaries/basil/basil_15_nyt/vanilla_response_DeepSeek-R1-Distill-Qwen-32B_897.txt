Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann. I need to make sure I capture all the key points. The article mentions the cover image, the reaction from conservatives, the comparison to past covers, and the response from Newsweek. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. Let me start by identifying the main elements: the cover image, the criticism, examples of similar past issues, and the outcome. I'll make sure to include quotes from critics and the response from Newsweek. Also, noting that the article itself didn't cause much outrage is important. I'll need to avoid any markdown and just provide the summary as plain text. Let me put it all together in a logical flow.

SUMMARY: Newsweek's recent cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy. The image, depicting Bachmann with wide, intense eyes and the caption "The Queen of Rage," has drawn criticism from conservatives and feminists alike. Critics argue the cover is biased, sexist, and disrespectful, with some questioning why such a portrayal would never be applied to a male politician. Newsweek defended itself by releasing additional outtakes, showing Bachmann in more neutral settings, but the backlash continued. This isn't the first time Newsweek has faced criticism for its cover choices, including past issues with Sarah Palin and Princess Diana. Despite the controversy, the accompanying article on Bachmann's role in the Tea Party movement received little backlash. END OF SUMMARY.
