SUMMARY:

The recent cover of Newsweek magazine featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy. The image shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed gaze, earning her the title "The Queen of Rage." Many in the conservative blogosphere have criticized the cover, accusing Newsweek of bias against conservatives. Even some unlikely allies, such as the president of the National Organization for Women, have deemed the cover "sexist" and suggested that a similar image would never be used for a male politician. Newsweek has responded by posting additional photos from the shoot, showcasing Bachmann's intensity in various settings. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced criticism for its cover choices, having previously been accused of sexism for a photo of Sarah Palin and creepiness for a computer-generated image of Princess Diana. The controversy highlights the importance of respectful and unbiased media representation.
