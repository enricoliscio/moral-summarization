Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this article about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann. They mentioned I'm a news summarizer assistant, so I need to make sure the summary is clear and concise, under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The cover has Bachmann with wide eyes, labeled "The Queen of Rage." Conservatives are upset, calling it disrespectful and biased. Even some feminists are criticizing it, saying it's sexist because they wouldn't do that to a man. Newsweek defended themselves by showing other photos, but the article itself didn't cause much outrage. There's also a mention of past controversial covers, like Sarah Palin and Princess Diana.

I need to structure the summary to include the cover description, the reactions from conservatives and feminists, Newsweek's response, and the context of previous controversies. I should keep each point brief to stay within the word limit.

I'll start by introducing the cover and the reaction. Then mention the conservative bloggers'不满, followed by the feminist criticism. Next, Newsweek's response with the outtakes. Finally, tie in the past issues to show a pattern.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language straightforward. Also, ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me check the word count as I draft to make sure it's under 200. I'll make sure each sentence is concise and only includes the essential details.

Alright, putting it all together now.

Conservatives and even some feminists criticize the image, calling it disrespectful and sexist. Critics argue the portrayal would not be used for a male candidate. Newsweek defended the cover by sharing additional photos of Bachmann, emphasizing her wide-eyed intensity. The article accompanying the cover, by Lois Romano, focuses on Bachmann’s role in the Tea Party movement and has not caused significant outrage. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its cover choices, including past controversies over photos of Sarah Palin and a computer-generated image of Princess Diana.
