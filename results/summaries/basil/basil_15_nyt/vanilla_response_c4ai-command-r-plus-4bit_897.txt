SUMMARY: Newsweek magazine's cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy among conservatives and some unlikely allies. The photo depicts Bachmann with wide-open eyes, focused intensely off in the distance, and has been criticized as disrespectful and sexist. The conservative blogosphere has questioned the media's bias against conservatives, while the president of the National Organization for Women, Terry O'Neill, called the cover sexist. Newsweek responded by posting other photos taken for the article, all depicting Bachmann with the same wide-eyed intensity. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced criticism for its cover choices, having previously sparked controversy with covers featuring Sarah Palin and Princess Diana. 

END OF SUMMARY.
