SUMMARY:
Newsweek magazine's recent cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked outrage among conservatives and unlikely allies alike. The photo, depicting Bachmann with wide-eyed intensity and labeled "The Queen of Rage," has been criticized as disrespectful and sexist. Many question the media's bias against conservatives, while others, like Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, point out the gendered nature of such depictions. This is not the first time Newsweek has courted controversy with its cover choices, having previously featured Sarah Palin in running shorts and a computer-generated image of Princess Diana's ghost. The magazine defended itself by releasing other photos from the Bachmann shoot, all portraying the same intense gaze, but the damage was done. Critics argue that such depictions would never be used for male candidates, highlighting a double standard in political media coverage. The incident underscores the ongoing challenges of navigating bias, sexism, and appropriate representation in political discourse.
