SUMMARY: Newsweek magazine has caused controversy once again with its choice of a cover image, this time of Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann. The photo, which depicts Bachmann with wide eyes and an intense expression, has been criticized by many in the conservative blogosphere as disrespectful and biased. The cover, which is accompanied by the title "The Queen of Rage," has sparked outrage, with some claiming that it makes Bachmann look crazy. The president of the National Organization for Women, Terry O'Neill, called the image sexist, arguing that such a portrayal would never be done to a man. In response to the backlash, Newsweek released additional photos from the shoot, all of which depict Bachmann with the same wide-eyed intensity. This is not the first time Newsweek has been accused of bias and sexism on its covers, having previously featured Sarah Palin in running shorts and a computer-generated image of Princess Diana's ghost. 
END OF SUMMARY.
