SUMMARY:

Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its latest cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, dubbed "The Queen of Rage." The image shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed stare, which many in the conservative blogosphere have deemed "crazy" and "biased." Even some unlikely allies, such as the president of the National Organization for Women, Terry O'Neill, have condemned the cover as "sexist" and "disrespectful," arguing that a similar portrayal would never be done to a man. Newsweek has responded by posting an "outtakes" gallery, showcasing other photos of Bachmann, but the damage may already be done. This is not the first time Newsweek has caused a stir with its cover choices, having previously been accused of sexism with a photo of Sarah Palin in running shorts and of being "creepy" with a computer-generated image of Princess Diana. The magazine's editors are once again under fire for their questionable judgment.
