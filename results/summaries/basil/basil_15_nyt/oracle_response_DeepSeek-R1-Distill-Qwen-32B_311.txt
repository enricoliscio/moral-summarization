Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann with a caption "The Queen of Rage." Conservatives and some feminists are upset, calling it disrespectful and sexist. The author used words like "puts," "crazy," "biased," "disrespectful," "sexist," "done," and "creepy." I need to include as many of these as possible.

I'll start by mentioning the cover and the reaction from conservatives. Then, note the feminists' take, using "sexist" and "done." Also, include the comparison to past covers, like Sarah Palin and Princess Diana, using "creepy." Finally, mention Newsweek's response with outtakes. Keep it under 200 words and end with the required tokens.

Conservatives and feminists alike criticized the image, calling it "disrespectful" and "sexist." Critics argued that such treatment would not be "done" to a male candidate, highlighting media bias. Newsweek defended itself by releasing outtakes showing Bachmann in more composed settings. The article also noted the magazine's history of controversial covers, including a "creepy" image of Princess Diana and a "sexist" portrayal of Sarah Palin. The cover has reignited debates about media bias and respectful representation of political figures. END OF SUMMARY.
