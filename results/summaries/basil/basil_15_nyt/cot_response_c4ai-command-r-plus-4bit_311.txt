SUMMARY:
The recent Newsweek cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked outrage among conservatives and unlikely allies alike, who have deemed it disrespectful and sexist. The cover, titled "The Queen of *Rage*", depicts Bachmann with wide-eyed intensity, a portrayal that has been criticized as making her look *crazy*. This incident has brought to light similar past controversies involving Newsweek's cover choices, such as the 2009 cover of Sarah Palin in running shorts and the 2011 cover featuring Princess Diana's ghost alongside the Duchess of Cambridge. Critics argue that these covers perpetuate a pattern of *biased* and *sexist* behavior by the media, with some questioning whether a male candidate would ever be subjected to similar treatment. Newsweek has responded by releasing additional photos from the Bachmann photoshoot, but the damage has already been done, with many questioning the magazine's editorial judgment and ethics.
