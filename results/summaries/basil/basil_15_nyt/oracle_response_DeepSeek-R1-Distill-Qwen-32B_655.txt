Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary that preserves the moral framing from the original article. The user provided the article and the specific morally charged words they want included. I need to make sure I capture those words in the summary without making it too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The cover of Newsweek features Michele Bachmann with a wide-eyed look, labeled "The Queen of Rage." Conservatives and some feminists are upset, calling it disrespectful and sexist. The article also mentions past controversial covers, like Sarah Palin and Princess Diana.

I need to include the words: puts, crazy, biased, disrespectful, sexist, done, creepy. I'll structure the summary to highlight the cover's impact, the reactions, and the comparison to past issues. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure each moral term is appropriately placed.

I'll start by introducing the cover and the reaction, then mention the feminist perspective and the comparison to other covers. Finally, I'll note Newsweek's response. This should cover all points while keeping the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY:  
Newsweek's cover featuring Republican candidate Michele Bachmann, labeled "The Queen of Rage," has sparked controversy. Conservatives and feminists alike criticize the image, calling it "disrespectful" and "sexist." Critics argue that such treatment would never be "done" to a male candidate, highlighting accusations of bias against conservatives. The cover has been described as making Bachmann look "crazy," with some comparing it to past controversial covers, like Sarah Palin in running shorts or Princess Diana's "creepy" ghost image. Newsweek defended itself by sharing outtakes, but the article itself has not caused significant outrage. The debate underscores ongoing tensions over media bias and respectful representation in political coverage.  
END OF SUMMARY.
