SUMMARY:

Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its latest cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann. The photo shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed stare, accompanied by the title "The Queen of Rage." Many conservatives have criticized the cover, accusing Newsweek of bias and disrespect. Even the National Organization for Women has weighed in, calling the cover "sexist" and suggesting that a similar photo would never be used for a male politician. Newsweek has responded by posting additional photos from the shoot, showcasing Bachmann in more mundane settings. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced criticism for its cover choices, with previous examples including a photo of Sarah Palin in running shorts and a computer-generated image of Princess Diana.
