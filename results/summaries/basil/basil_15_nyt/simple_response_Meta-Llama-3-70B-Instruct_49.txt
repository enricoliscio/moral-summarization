SUMMARY:

Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its latest cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, dubbed "The Queen of Rage." The image shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed gaze, prompting criticism from conservatives and even some unlikely allies, who deem it "sexist" and "disrespectful." The National Organization for Women's president, Terry O'Neill, argues that such a portrayal would never be done to a man. Newsweek responded by posting an "outtakes" gallery, showcasing other photos of Bachmann, but the damage was done. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash over its cover choices, having previously published images of Sarah Palin in running shorts and a computer-generated image of Princess Diana. The moral framing of this story highlights the importance of respectful and unbiased representation of political figures, particularly women, in the media.
