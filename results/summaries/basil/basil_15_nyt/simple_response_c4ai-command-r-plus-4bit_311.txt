SUMMARY: Newsweek magazine has caused controversy by featuring a photo of Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann on its cover that many perceive as disrespectful and sexist. The photo, which depicts Bachmann with wide-eyed intensity, has sparked outrage among conservatives and unlikely allies, including the National Organization for Women, who have called out the magazine for its biased portrayal of a female political figure. This incident adds to Newsweek's history of controversial cover choices involving conservative women, such as Sarah Palin and Princess Diana. The magazine responded by releasing other photos from the same photoshoot, but the damage was already done, with critics questioning the media's bias against conservatives and the perpetuation of sexist stereotypes. This incident highlights the ongoing challenges of balancing newsworthiness and respect in political journalism, especially when it comes to the representation of women in powerful positions.
