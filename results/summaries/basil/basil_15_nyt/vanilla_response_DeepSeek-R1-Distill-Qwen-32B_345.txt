Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann with the caption "The Queen of Rage." It mentions that conservatives and some feminists are upset, saying it's sexist and biased. Newsweek defended themselves by showing outtakes where Bachmann looks similar. The article also notes that Newsweek has had similar controversies before, like with Sarah Palin and Princess Diana.

Okay, so the main points are: Bachmann's cover, the reaction from conservatives and feminists, Newsweek's response, and past controversies. I should keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the cover and the reactions, then mention the outtakes and past issues. Make sure to include that both sides criticized the cover and that the article itself didn't cause much fuss. That should cover all the key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Newsweek's cover featuring Republican candidate Michele Bachmann with the caption "The Queen of Rage" has sparked controversy. Conservatives and feminists alike criticized the image, with some calling it sexist and biased. Newsweek defended the cover by publishing outtakes showing Bachmann with the same wide-eyed expression. The article accompanying the cover, by Lois Romano, focused on Bachmann's role in the Tea Party movement and has not drawn significant backlash. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced criticism for its cover choices, including past controversies involving Sarah Palin and Princess Diana. END OF SUMMARY.
