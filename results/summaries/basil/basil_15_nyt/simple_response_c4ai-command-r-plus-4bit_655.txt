SUMMARY: Newsweek magazine has caused controversy once again by choosing a photo of Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann that many perceive as disrespectful and sexist. The wide-eyed, intense photo of Bachmann, dubbed "The Queen of Rage," has sparked outrage from both conservatives and unlikely allies like the National Organization for Women. This incident recalls similar controversies in 2009 with a photo of Sarah Palin and in June 2022 with an image of Princess Diana's ghost alongside the Duchess of Cambridge. Critics argue that such choices are biased against conservatives and perpetuate sexist double standards in media representation. The magazine responded by releasing additional photos from the same shoot, but the damage to their reputation and the perception of bias remain.
END OF SUMMARY.
