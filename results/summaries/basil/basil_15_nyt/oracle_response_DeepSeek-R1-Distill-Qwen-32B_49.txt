Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann, with the headline "The Queen of Rage." The image shows her with wide eyes, and conservative bloggers are upset, calling it disrespectful and biased. They argue that the media is targeting conservatives. Even Terry O’Neill from NOW comments, calling it sexist and pointing out that such treatment wouldn't happen to a man. Newsweek defended themselves by showing outtakes, but the issue remains. The article also mentions past controversial covers, like Sarah Palin and the Duchess of Cambridge with Princess Diana.

The user wants a summary that includes the morally framed words: puts, crazy, biased, disrespectful, sexist, done, creepy. I need to make sure these words are included. 

I should start by introducing the cover and the reaction. Mention the conservative bloggers' anger, using "puts" and "crazy." Then include the NOW's perspective on "sexist" and the comparison to men. Newsweek's response with outtakes, but the issue persists. Also, reference past covers with "biased" and "creepy." 

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring all key points are covered without losing the moral elements.
