SUMMARY:
Newsweek magazine's recent cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked outrage among conservatives and unlikely allies alike. The photo, which depicts Bachmann with wide-eyed intensity and is titled "The Queen of Rage," has been criticized as disrespectful and sexist. This incident echoes a similar controversy in 2009 when Newsweek chose a photo of Sarah Palin in running shorts, and another in June 2021 when they featured a computer-generated image of Princess Diana's ghost alongside the Duchess of Cambridge. Critics argue that such choices are biased and disrespectful, especially towards conservative women. The magazine defended its choice by releasing additional photos from the shoot, all portraying Bachmann with the same intense expression. However, the accompanying article by Lois Romano, focusing on Bachmann's role in the Tea Party movement, did not generate similar outrage. This incident highlights the ongoing debate about the media's portrayal of female politicians and the potential bias and sexism that may be involved. END OF SUMMARY.
