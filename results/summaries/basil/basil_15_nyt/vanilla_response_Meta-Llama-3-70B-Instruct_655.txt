SUMMARY:

Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its latest cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann. The cover photo shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed expression, accompanied by the title "The Queen of Rage." Many conservatives have criticized the image, calling it biased and disrespectful. Even some unlikely allies, such as the president of the National Organization for Women, have labeled the cover as sexist. Newsweek has responded to the backlash by posting additional photos from the shoot, showcasing Bachmann in various settings with a similar intense expression. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced criticism for its cover choices, having previously been accused of sexism for a photo of Sarah Palin and creepiness for a computer-generated image of Princess Diana.
