SUMMARY:
Newsweek magazine's recent cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked outrage among conservatives and unlikely allies alike. The photo depicts Bachmann with wide-eyed intensity, labeled as the "Queen of Rage." Many have criticized the image as disrespectful and sexist, questioning the media's bias against conservatives. This incident echoes a similar controversy in 2009 when Newsweek featured Sarah Palin in running shorts, also deemed sexist. Another questionable cover from June featured Princess Diana's ghost alongside the Duchess of Cambridge. The magazine defended its choice by releasing additional photos from the Bachmann photoshoot, all portraying the same intense expression. The article itself, however, sparked little outrage, focusing on Bachmann's role in the Tea Party movement. This incident highlights the challenges of ethical journalism and the perception of media bias.
