Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Michele Bachmann's Newsweek cover. They mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, the article talks about how the cover photo made Bachmann look intense, with the caption "The Queen of Rage." The conservative bloggers are upset, calling it biased and sexist. Even some feminists are saying it's unfair because it wouldn't happen to a man. Newsweek defended themselves by showing other photos, but the issue still caused a stir, similar to past covers of Palin and the Duchess of Cambridge. 

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects, like the bias and sexism accusations. Also, it's important to note the reaction from different groups—conservatives and feminists. The user wants the summary to be concise, under 200 words, so I'll have to be brief but include all key points. I should start with the cover and the reaction, mention the accusations, and then the context of Newsweek's past controversial covers. 

Let me structure it: mention the cover, the caption, the reactions from conservatives and feminists, Newsweek's response, and the historical context. That should cover all the moral framing elements the user wants. I'll make sure it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
This week's Newsweek cover features a photo of Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, with her eyes wide open and a caption reading "The Queen of Rage." The image has sparked outrage, particularly in conservative circles, with critics accusing the magazine of bias and sexism. Conservative bloggers argue the photo portrays Bachmann as "crazy" and question the mainstream media's fairness. Even feminists, like Terry O’Neill of the National Organization for Women, have criticized the cover, suggesting such treatment would never be applied to a male politician. Newsweek defended itself by releasing additional photos from the photo shoot, showing Bachmann in more neutral settings, but the controversy persists. The article accompanying the cover, by Lois Romano, focuses on Bachmann's role in the Tea Party movement and has not drawn the same level of criticism. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for its cover choices, with past examples including photos of Sarah Palin and Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, drawing similar accusations of bias and insensitivity.  
END OF SUMMARY.
