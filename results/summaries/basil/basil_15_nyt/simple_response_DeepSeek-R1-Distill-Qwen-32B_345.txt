Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand what's going on.

The article is about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann with the caption "The Queen of Rage." The photo shows her with wide eyes, and conservative bloggers are upset, calling it biased. Even some feminists are criticizing it as sexist, pointing out that such treatment wouldn't happen to a man. Newsweek defended themselves by showing other photos from the shoot, but the article itself didn't cause much controversy. They also mentioned past controversial covers, like Sarah Palin and Princess Diana.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no more than 200 words, ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I need to make sure I capture the key points: the cover image, the reactions from conservatives and feminists, Newsweek's response, and the context of previous controversial covers.

I should start by mentioning the cover and the caption. Then, highlight the conservative backlash and the feminist criticism, emphasizing the sexism angle. Include Newsweek's response with the outtakes. Finally, reference the past covers to show a pattern.

I need to keep the language clear and concise, making sure each point flows logically. Also, preserve the moral framing by showing how both conservatives and feminists are upset, indicating a broader issue with Newsweek's approach.

Let me structure it: introduce the cover, describe the reactions, mention the outtakes, and then the historical context. That should cover all the necessary points succinctly.

SUMMARY: Newsweek's recent cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, titled "The Queen of Rage," has sparked controversy. The image, showing Bachmann with wide, intense eyes, has drawn criticism from conservative bloggers, who accuse the magazine of bias. Some feminists, including Terry Oâ€™Neill of the National Organization for Women, argue the cover is sexist, pointing out that such imagery would not be used for a male politician. Newsweek defended the cover by releasing outtakes from the photo shoot, which showed Bachmann in more mundane settings but with the same intense expression. The article accompanying the cover, by Lois Romano, has not generated significant backlash. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced criticism for its cover choices, including a 2009 image of Sarah Palin and a 2011 cover featuring Princess Diana's "ghost." The controversy highlights ongoing debates about media bias and the treatment of female political figures. END OF SUMMARY.
