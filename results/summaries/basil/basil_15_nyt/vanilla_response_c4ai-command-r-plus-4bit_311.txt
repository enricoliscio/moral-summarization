SUMMARY: Newsweek's recent cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has sparked controversy among conservatives and unlikely allies alike. The photo depicts Bachmann with wide-open eyes, focused intensely off in the distance, and has been criticized as disrespectful and sexist. The conservative blogosphere has voiced its displeasure, with some suggesting that the Mainstream Media is biased against conservatives. Newsweek responded by releasing additional photos from the shoot, all of which portray Bachmann with the same wide-eyed intensity. This is not the first time Newsweek has caused a stir with its cover choices, having previously featured Sarah Palin in running shorts and a computer-generated image of Princess Diana's ghost. The accompanying article, however, generated little outrage.
END OF SUMMARY.
