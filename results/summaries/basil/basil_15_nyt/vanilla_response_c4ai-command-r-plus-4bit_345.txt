SUMMARY: This week's Newsweek cover features a photo of Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann with a wide-eyed expression, sparking outrage among conservatives and some unlikely allies who deemed it disrespectful and sexist. The photo, accompanied by the title "The Queen of Rage," has been criticized for portraying Bachmann in a negative light, with some suggesting that such a depiction would never be used for a male candidate. In response, Newsweek released additional photos from the shoot, all of which showcase Bachmann's intense expression. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced criticism for its cover choices, having previously featured Sarah Palin in running shorts and a computer-generated image of Princess Diana alongside the Duchess of Cambridge. The article accompanying the Bachmann cover, however, has generated little controversy, focusing on Bachmann's role in the Tea Party movement and her national prominence.
END OF SUMMARY.
