SUMMARY: Newsweek magazine has caused controversy once again with its choice of cover image, this time featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann. The photo, which depicts Bachmann with her eyes open wide and focused intensely off in the distance, has been criticized by many in the conservative blogosphere as disrespectful and biased. The use of this particular image has sparked outrage, with some claiming that it makes Bachmann "look crazy." Even the National Organization for Women has spoken out against the cover, calling it sexist and asking if the same treatment would be given to a male politician. This incident adds to a history of questionable cover choices by Newsweek, including a 2009 photo of Sarah Palin in running shorts and a recent creepy image of Princess Diana's ghost alongside the Duchess of Cambridge. The article itself, however, seems to have generated little controversy. This incident raises questions about the ethical boundaries of media representation, especially when it comes to portraying female political figures.
END OF SUMMARY.
