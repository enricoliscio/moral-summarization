SUMMARY:

Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its latest cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, dubbed "The Queen of Rage." The image shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed stare, prompting critics to accuse the magazine of being biased and disrespectful. Conservative bloggers have cried foul, with some even suggesting that the cover makes Bachmann look "crazy." The National Organization for Women's president, Terry O'Neill, has also weighed in, calling the cover "sexist" and arguing that a similar image would never be used for a male politician. Newsweek has responded by releasing additional photos from the shoot, showcasing Bachmann in more mundane settings, but the damage may already be done. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced criticism for its cover choices, having previously been accused of sexism for a photo of Sarah Palin and of being "creepy" for a computer-generated image of Princess Diana.

END OF SUMMARY.
