SUMMARY: Newsweek magazine caused controversy by featuring a photo of Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann on its cover that many perceived as disrespectful and sexist. The photo, which highlighted Bachmann's wide-eyed intensity, was criticized by both conservatives and unlikely allies like the National Organization for Women, who questioned the media's bias against conservatives and the sexist treatment of female politicians. This incident adds to Newsweek's history of controversial cover choices involving conservative women, such as Sarah Palin and Princess Diana. The magazine responded by releasing additional photos from the same photoshoot, but the damage was already done, with many questioning the ethics of such portrayals.
END OF SUMMARY.
