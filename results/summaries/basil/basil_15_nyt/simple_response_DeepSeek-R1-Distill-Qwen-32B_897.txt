Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article talks about Newsweek's cover featuring Michele Bachmann with the caption "The Queen of Rage." The cover image has Bachmann with wide eyes, looking intense. The conservative blogosphere is upset, calling it disrespectful and biased. They question the editors' decision to portray her that way.

I notice that Terry O’Neill from NOW is also criticizing it as sexist, comparing it to how men wouldn't be portrayed similarly. This highlights a gender bias angle. Newsweek defended themselves by showing other photos from the shoot, which didn't seem to calm the controversy.

Looking back, Newsweek had similar issues before, like with Sarah Palin and Princess Diana. These past incidents add context about the magazine's tendency to create controversial covers.

I need to make sure the summary captures the main points: the cover image, the reactions from conservatives and feminists, the comparison to past covers, and Newsweek's response. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral aspects discussed, like sexism and bias.

I'll structure it by first mentioning the cover and the caption, then the reactions from different groups, the comparison to past covers, and finally Newsweek's response. I'll ensure it's clear and flows well, sticking to the word limit.

SUMMARY: Newsweek's recent cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann with the caption "The Queen of Rage" has sparked controversy. The image, showing Bachmann with wide, intense eyes, has been criticized by conservatives as disrespectful and biased. Critics argue that such a portrayal would not be used for a male candidate, highlighting gender bias. Terry O’Neill of the National Organization for Women called the cover sexist, using Gloria Steinem’s test to question if such treatment would ever be applied to a man. Newsweek defended itself by releasing outtakes from the photo session, which showed Bachmann in more mundane settings but with the same intense expression. The article accompanying the cover, by Lois Romano, has not generated significant outrage. This is not the first time Newsweek has faced backlash for controversial covers, including a 2009 image of Sarah Palin and a 2011 cover featuring Princess Diana’s ghost. The incident reflects ongoing debates about media bias and gendered portrayals of political figures. END OF SUMMARY.
