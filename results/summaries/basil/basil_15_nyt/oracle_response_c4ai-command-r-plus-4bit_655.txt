SUMMARY: Newsweek's recent cover featuring a photo of Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann with her eyes wide open has sparked outrage among conservatives and some unlikely allies. The photo, accompanied by the title "The Queen of Rage," has been criticized as disrespectful and sexist. Many believe that the photo intentionally makes Bachmann look crazy and that the mainstream media is biased against conservatives. This incident echoes a similar controversy in 2009 when Newsweek featured a photo of Sarah Palin in running shorts, which was also deemed sexist. Additionally, the magazine's use of a computer-generated image of Princess Diana's ghost on a cover earlier this year was labeled as creepy. Newsweek's response to the backlash over the Bachmann cover was to release additional photos from the shoot, all of which portrayed Bachmann with the same wide-eyed intensity. While the accompanying article by Lois Romano sparked little outrage, the magazine's choice of cover photo has once again brought attention to the issue of biased and disrespectful media representation of conservative women. END OF SUMMARY.
