SUMMARY:
Newsweek magazine has sparked controversy with its latest cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, dubbed "The Queen of Rage". The cover photo shows Bachmann with an intense, wide-eyed stare, which many in the conservative blogosphere have deemed "disrespectful" and "biased" against conservatives. Even unlikely allies, such as the National Organization for Women, have criticized the cover as "sexist", arguing that a similar photo would never be used for a male candidate. Newsweek has responded by posting additional photos from the shoot, showcasing Bachmann's intensity in various settings. This is not the first time Newsweek has caused a stir with its cover choices, having previously been accused of "sexist" and "creepy" covers featuring Sarah Palin and Princess Diana. The article itself, which explores Bachmann's place in the Tea Party movement, has sparked little "outrage". END OF SUMMARY.
