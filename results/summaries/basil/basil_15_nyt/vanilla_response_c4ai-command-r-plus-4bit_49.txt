SUMMARY: Newsweek magazine's cover featuring Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann sparked controversy due to its unflattering portrayal. The photo depicts Bachmann with wide, intense eyes, and the headline "The Queen of Rage," leading many to criticize it as sexist and disrespectful. The conservative blogosphere and even unlikely allies like the National Organization for Women denounced the cover. Newsweek responded by releasing outtakes from the photoshoot, but the damage was done. This incident adds to Newsweek's history of controversial covers, including a 2009 photo of Sarah Palin in running shorts and a 2021 cover featuring Princess Diana's ghost.
