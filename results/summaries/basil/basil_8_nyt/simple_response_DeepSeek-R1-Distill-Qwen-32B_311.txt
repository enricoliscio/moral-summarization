Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Larry Summers warning about a double-dip recession if the tax deal isn't passed. The administration is trying to counter criticism from Democrats who feel the president caved to Republicans.

I should note that the article highlights Obama's defense of the deal, saying it makes sense and that the American people are expecting action. Biden is involved in meeting with House Democrats to push the compromise. The administration is using economic forecasts to support the deal, citing growth and job creation.

On the other side, there's significant opposition from liberal Democrats and interest groups. They're calling the deal irresponsible and unfair. Some lawmakers are firmly against it, and there's a letter signed by many House Democrats opposing the deal.

I need to make sure the summary captures both the administration's support and the opposition's criticism, highlighting the tension. Also, include the economic projections and the political maneuvering. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and preserve the moral elements like responsibility, fairness, and the impact on the economy and workers.

I'll structure the summary to start with the warning, then the administration's efforts, followed by the opposition, and end with the political dynamics. Make sure it's clear and balanced, reflecting both sides' arguments without bias.

SUMMARY:  
Larry Summers, outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failing to pass the tax deal announced by President Obama would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration is countering criticism from Democrats who argue Obama conceded too much to Republicans. Obama defended the deal, stating it makes sense and urged Congress to act, emphasizing the American people’s expectation for action. Vice President Biden is meeting with House Democrats to promote the compromise, while the White House is circulating endorsements from economists and Democratic officials to support the deal. However, opposition remains strong among liberal Democrats and interest groups, with over three dozen House Democrats opposing the deal, calling it "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." The administration’s efforts to secure support are facing significant resistance, with many lawmakers expressing disappointment in Obama’s approach.  

END OF SUMMARY.
