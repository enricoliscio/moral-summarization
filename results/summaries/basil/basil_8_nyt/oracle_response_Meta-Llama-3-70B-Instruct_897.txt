SUMMARY:

Larry Summers, outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failing to pass the tax deal would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. President Obama disputed claims that Democrats feel betrayed by the deal, saying it makes sense and urging Congress to take action. The administration is pushing back against criticism, citing endorsements from economists and Democratic officeholders. However, many Democrats remain outraged, calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." Despite the backlash, the White House is emphasizing the potential benefits, including increased economic growth and job creation. David Axelrod warned that middle-class Americans would "get screwed" if their tax cuts are not extended, while John Podesta acknowledged the deal is "a steep price" but necessary to help working Americans. The administration's efforts to quell the uproar may fall short, as many Democrats, including Representative Barney Frank, remain firmly opposed to the deal.
