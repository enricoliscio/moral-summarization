SUMMARY:
Outgoing National Economic Council Chairman Larry Summers warned that failing to pass the tax deal would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. President Obama disputed claims that Democrats feel betrayed by his deal with Congressional Republicans, saying it makes sense and would increase economic growth. However, many Democrats remain outraged, calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." Despite the administration's efforts to sell the compromise, over 30 Democratic senators and close to three dozen House Democrats remain opposed to the deal. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. attempted to quell the uproar among liberals, but many, like Representative Barney Frank, feel coerced and refuse to vote for it. The administration's message machine highlighted supportive comments from various economic forecasters and Democratic officeholders, but the public relations offensive has been met with public expressions of outrage from the president's base. END OF SUMMARY.
