Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warning that failing to pass a tax deal could increase the risk of a double-dip recession. He made these remarks with Robert Gibbs and David Axelrod. The administration is defending the deal against criticism from Democrats who think Obama caved to Republicans. Obama himself said the deal makes sense and urged Congress to act. Biden is meeting with House Democrats to sell the deal, and the White House is getting endorsements from various economists and officials. However, many Democrats are upset, with over 30 House members opposing it, and some senators remain firmly against it as well. The administration is using economic projections to support the deal, but there's a lot of internal opposition.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention Summers' warning, the administration's defense, Obama's comments, Biden's meetings, the support from economists, and the opposition from Democrats. Also, include the economic projections but note the criticism.

Let me structure it: Start with Summers' warning, then the administration's pushback, Obama's stance, Biden's efforts, the support they're getting, and the opposition from within the party. Keep it concise, making sure each key point is included without too much detail.

I should avoid getting bogged down in specifics like the number of House members or the exact job projections. Focus on the main elements: the tax deal, the risk of recession, administration's support, and internal Democratic opposition.

Make sure the summary flows logically, starting from the warning, then the administration's response, their efforts to gain support, and the opposition they're facing. End with the split within the party and the economic projections.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, let me put it all together in a coherent summary.
