SUMMARY: The Obama administration is facing criticism from fellow Democrats and liberal interest groups over the president's recent tax deal with Congressional Republicans. Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failing to pass a package like the tax deal could lead to a double-dip recession. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to sell the compromise, while the White House circulated endorsements from economists and Democratic officeholders. However, close to three dozen House Democrats have signed a letter calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible." Some Democratic senators and lawmakers remain firmly opposed to the deal, expressing disappointment with the president. White House advisers and allies, such as David Axelrod and John Podesta, defended the deal, emphasizing the potential economic benefits and the need to avoid a deadlock. The administration is facing a challenge in trying to quell the uproar among liberals and gain support for the tax deal.
