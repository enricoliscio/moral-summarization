SUMMARY: The Obama administration defended the tax deal negotiated with Republicans against criticism from fellow Democrats, arguing that failure to pass the deal would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, and David Axelrod, the president's chief political adviser, emphasized the deal's potential to boost economic growth and job creation. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to sell the compromise, while the White House circulated endorsements from economists, analysts, and Democratic officeholders. However, some Democrats in Congress, including close to three dozen House members, signed a letter calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible." Despite the administration's efforts, some Democratic senators and lawmakers remained firmly opposed to the deal, expressing disappointment with the president. Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts stated his intention to vote against the deal, refusing to feel coerced.
