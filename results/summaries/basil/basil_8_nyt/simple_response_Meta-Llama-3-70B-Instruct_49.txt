SUMMARY:

Outgoing National Economic Council Chairman Larry Summers warns that failing to pass the tax deal announced by President Obama would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration is pushing back against criticism from fellow Democrats that the president has caved too much to Republicans. President Obama emphasizes the importance of passing the deal, citing economists' revised growth forecasts and the potential creation of 1.6 million jobs. However, many Democrats, including liberal members of Congress and interest groups, are outraged, calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." Vice President Biden is meeting with House Democrats to sell the compromise, but faces strong opposition. The moral framing of the article suggests that the administration's deal is a necessary compromise to avoid economic disaster, while critics see it as a betrayal of liberal values.
