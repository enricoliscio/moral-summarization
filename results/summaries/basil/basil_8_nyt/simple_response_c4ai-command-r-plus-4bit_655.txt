SUMMARY: The Obama administration scrambled to defend a tax deal with Republicans on Wednesday as a chorus of criticism mounted from the left, threatening one of the president’s signature initiatives. The White House press office circulated supportive comments from economists and Democrats, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. returned to Capitol Hill to meet with House Democrats. Administration officials argued that failure to pass the deal would risk a double-dip recession and that the more people examined it, the more they would agree with the president. But some three dozen House Democrats have already signed a letter calling the deal “fiscally irresponsible” and “grossly unfair.” The sense of disappointment among Democrats on the Hill remained strong, with Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts saying he did not feel he should be “coerced” into voting for the deal. END OF SUMMARY.
