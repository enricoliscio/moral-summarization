SUMMARY:

Outgoing National Economic Council Chairman Larry Summers warned that failing to pass the tax deal announced by President Obama would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration is pushing back against criticism from fellow Democrats that the president has caved too much to Republicans. President Obama disputed claims that Democrats feel betrayed by the deal, saying that "the more who look at it, the more will say this makes sense." Vice President Joe Biden met with House Democrats to sell the compromise, as the White House circulated statements of support from economic forecasters, liberal analysts, and Democratic officeholders. Despite the administration's efforts, many Democrats remain opposed to the deal, with close to three dozen House Democrats signing a letter calling it "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair."

END OF SUMMARY.
