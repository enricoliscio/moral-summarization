Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

So, Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman, warns about a double-dip recession if the tax deal isn't passed. The administration is pushing back against Democrats who think Obama caved to Republicans. Obama says the deal makes sense and urges Congress to act. Biden is meeting with House Democrats to sell the deal. The White House is using endorsements from various economists and politicians to support the deal. They also highlight job creation and growth projections. However, there's a lot of backlash from liberals, with many House Democrats opposing it, calling it fiscally irresponsible. Some senators are firmly against it too. Barney Frank says he won't vote for it and feels coerced.

I need to capture the key points: Summers' warning, administration's defense, Obama's stance, Biden's efforts, the PR campaign with endorsements, and the strong opposition from the left. The moral framing here is the tension between compromise for economic stability and criticism for not being progressive enough.

I should structure the summary to include these elements, keeping it under 200 words. Make sure to mention the administration's efforts to justify the deal and the significant opposition from within their own party. Also, highlight the economic projections versus the criticism for fairness.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes all these points without getting too detailed.
