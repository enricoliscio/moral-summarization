SUMMARY:
Outgoing National Economic Council Chairman Larry Summers warned that failing to pass the tax deal would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. President Obama disputed claims that Democrats feel betrayed by his deal with Congressional Republicans, saying that "the more who look at it, the more will say this makes sense." However, many Democrats remain outraged, calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." Despite the administration's efforts to sell the compromise, including Vice President Biden's meeting with House Democrats, around 30 Democratic senators and close to three dozen House Democrats remain firmly opposed to the deal. Some, like Representative Barney Frank, feel coerced into voting for it. The White House has countered with endorsements from economic forecasters and Democratic officeholders, but the deal's fate remains uncertain. END OF SUMMARY.
