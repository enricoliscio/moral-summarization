SUMMARY:

Larry Summers, outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failing to pass the tax deal announced by President Obama would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration is pushing back against criticism from fellow Democrats, who feel betrayed by the president's compromise with Congressional Republicans. President Obama emphasized the importance of taking action, saying "the American people are watching, and they're expecting action on our parts." He believes that the more people examine the agreement, the more they will see that it makes sense. The White House is countering condemnations from Democrats by circulating endorsements from economic forecasters, liberal analysts, and Democratic officeholders. However, the public relations offensive is being met with outrage from the president's base, including liberal members of Congress and interest groups on the left, who call the tax deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." Vice President Biden is trying to sell the compromise to House Democrats, but many remain firmly opposed.

END OF SUMMARY.
