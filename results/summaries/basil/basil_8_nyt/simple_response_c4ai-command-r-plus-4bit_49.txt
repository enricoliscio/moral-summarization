SUMMARY: In an attempt to quell the backlash from fellow Democrats, President Obama defended his controversial tax deal with Republicans, arguing that it was necessary to prevent a double-dip recession. The White House mobilized a public relations offensive, citing endorsements from economists and Democratic leaders, but faced fierce opposition from liberal members of Congress and interest groups. Larry Summers, the outgoing National Economic Council chairman, warned of increased recession risks without the deal. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to sell the compromise, but many remained opposed, including Representative Barney Frank, who felt he should not be "coerced" into supporting it. The administration emphasized job creation and economic growth projections from economists, while the Democratic National Committee circulated supportive statements. Despite this, close to three dozen House Democrats signed a letter calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible." The intense debate underscores the moral imperative of responsible governance and the ethical duty to prioritize the economic well-being of Americans over political differences. END OF SUMMARY.
