Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. The article is about Larry Summers warning about a double-dip recession if the tax deal isn't passed, and the administration's efforts to defend it against criticism from Democrats.

First, I'll start by mentioning Summers' warning about the risk of a double-dip recession if the package fails. That uses "failure" and "recession." Then, I'll note Obama's response, using "failure" again when he says people will realize it makes sense. 

Next, I should include the administration's pushback against criticism, using "failure" and "betrayed." I'll mention Biden's efforts to sell the deal, using "failure" again. The White House is highlighting support from economists, which ties into "create" jobs and "helping" working Americans. 

On the other side, there's outrage from Democrats, using "outrage," "fiscally irresponsible," and "grossly unfair." They're opposing the deal, so I'll use "back down," "vote," and "won." 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it flows naturally while including as many of the moral words as possible. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point incorporates the necessary terms without making it sound forced.

SUMMARY: Larry Summers warned that failing to pass the tax deal would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. President Obama defended the deal, stating it makes sense and urging Congress to act. Vice President Biden is meeting with House Democrats to sell the compromise, while the White House highlights endorsements from economists and Democratic officials. However, liberal Democrats and interest groups express outrage, calling the deal fiscally irresponsible and unfair. Representative Peter Welch led a letter opposing the deal, and many Democrats remain firmly opposed. Summers emphasized the need for action to help working Americans, while critics argue the deal was a steep price. The administration's push for the deal faces strong resistance, with some lawmakers refusing to vote for it, fearing they would be "screwed" if tax cuts aren't extended. END OF SUMMARY.
