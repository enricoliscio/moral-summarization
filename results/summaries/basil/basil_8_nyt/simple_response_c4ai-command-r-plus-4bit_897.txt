SUMMARY: As the Obama administration scrambles to quell criticism from fellow Democrats over the president's recent tax deal with Congressional Republicans, top economic advisers warn that failure to pass such a package would greatly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The White House has launched a public relations offensive, citing endorsements from economists, analysts, and Democratic officeholders, who support the deal as a necessary compromise to boost economic growth and create jobs. Vice President Biden has been dispatched to Capitol Hill to sell the deal to House Democrats, but faces strong opposition from liberal members of Congress and interest groups on the left, who view the deal as a betrayal of Democratic values. Despite the administration's efforts, close to three dozen House Democrats have signed a letter calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and vowing to stand firm against it. This moral dilemma between economic necessity and ideological purity sets the stage for a contentious debate within the Democratic Party, with the potential for far-reaching consequences for the nation's economy. END OF SUMMARY.
