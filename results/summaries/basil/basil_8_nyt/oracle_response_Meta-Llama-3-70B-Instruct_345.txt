SUMMARY:

Larry Summers, outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failure to pass the tax deal would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. President Obama emphasized the importance of taking action, saying "the American people are watching, and they're expecting action on our parts." He urged Congress to examine the agreement and have a thorough debate, but ultimately get it done. The administration is pushing back against criticism from fellow Democrats, who feel betrayed by the deal with Congressional Republicans. Vice President Biden is meeting with House Democrats to sell the compromise, as the White House seeks to quell the outrage among liberals. The administration is highlighting supportive comments from economic forecasters and Democratic officeholders, who argue that the deal will help working Americans and create jobs. However, many Democrats remain firmly opposed, calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." The sense of disappointment with the president remains strong, with some lawmakers refusing to vote for the deal.

END OF SUMMARY.
