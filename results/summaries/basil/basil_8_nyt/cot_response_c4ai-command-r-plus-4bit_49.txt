SUMMARY:
President Obama is facing fierce criticism from fellow Democrats and liberal interest groups over his decision to compromise with Congressional Republicans on tax cuts. Many Democrats, including close to three dozen House members, have signed a letter calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." They argue that the president should not *back down* and *betrayed* them by caving to Republican demands. The White House has launched a public relations offensive, citing endorsements from economists and analysts who project that the deal will boost economic growth and create jobs. However, the administration's efforts have been met with *outrage* by the president's liberal base, who feel a sense of *disappointment* and believe they are being *coerced*. Despite the pushback, about 30 Democratic senators remain *firmly opposed* to the deal, and House Democrats are also voicing their strong objections. Vice President Biden has been tasked with trying to sell the compromise to Congress, but it remains to be seen if he will be successful in swaying his fellow Democrats. The president, however, maintains that "economists across the country have upwardly revised their forecasts for growth" and that the deal "makes sense."
