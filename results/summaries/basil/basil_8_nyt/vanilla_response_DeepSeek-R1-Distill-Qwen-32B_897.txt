Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The main points are about Larry Summers warning about a double-dip recession if the tax deal isn't passed. Obama is defending the deal, saying it makes sense and that Congress should act. There's also a lot about the administration trying to convince Democrats, with Biden meeting with House Dems again. Some economists support the deal, projecting growth and job creation. But there's a lot of opposition from within the Democratic party, with many members calling it unfair and opposing it. I should include the key players, the arguments for and against the deal, and the current state of support within Congress. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure it's concise but covers all main points.

SUMMARY: Larry Summers, outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failing to pass President Obama's tax deal could increase the risk of a double-dip recession. Obama defended the deal, emphasizing its importance and urging Congress to act. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to garner support, while the administration highlighted endorsements from economists and Democratic officials. However, many Democrats, including liberal members and interest groups, criticized the deal as "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." Despite economic projections of growth and job creation, opposition within the party remains strong, with several lawmakers vowing not to support the agreement. END OF SUMMARY.
