SUMMARY: Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failing to pass a package like the tax deal negotiated by President Obama with Congressional Republicans could lead to a double-dip recession. The Obama administration has been pushing back against criticism from fellow Democrats, arguing that the deal will boost economic growth and create jobs. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to sell the compromise, while the White House circulated statements of support from economists, analysts, and Democratic officeholders. However, the deal has faced strong opposition from liberal members of Congress and interest groups on the left, who view it as a capitulation to Republicans and fiscally irresponsible. Close to three dozen House Democrats have signed a letter criticizing the deal, and many Democratic lawmakers remain disappointed with the president's decision to compromise.
END OF SUMMARY.
