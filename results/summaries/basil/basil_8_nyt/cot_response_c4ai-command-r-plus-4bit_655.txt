SUMMARY:
The Obama administration is facing strong backlash from fellow Democrats and liberal interest groups over the president's recent tax deal with Congressional Republicans. Despite the administration's efforts to defend the deal, many Democrats remain firmly opposed, with some even calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." Larry Summers, the outgoing National Economic Council chairman, warned that failing to pass such a package would heighten the risk of a double-dip recession. The White House has been actively seeking to quell the moral outrage from liberals, emphasizing support from economists and Democratic officeholders. However, close to three dozen House Democrats have signed a letter expressing their disappointment and refusal to back down. Vice President Biden faced a contentious meeting with House Democrats, similar to his prior encounter with Senate Democrats, as many lawmakers feel coerced and betrayed by the president's compromise. The administration's public relations offensive is being met with moral outrage and a sense of betrayal from the president's base, creating a challenging situation for the White House.
