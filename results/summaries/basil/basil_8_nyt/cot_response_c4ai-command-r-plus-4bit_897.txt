SUMMARY:
The Obama administration is facing strong criticism from fellow Democrats and liberal interest groups over the president's recent tax deal with Congressional Republicans. The deal has been described as a "cave" to Republicans, and many Democrats feel betrayed and outraged by the president's decision. The White House has been pushing back against this criticism, with top economic and political advisers arguing that failure to pass such a deal would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. They have circulated endorsements from economists and officeholders to support their case. However, close to three dozen House Democrats have signed a letter calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair," refusing to back down and feeling coerced. Vice President Biden has been sent to Capitol Hill to meet with House Democrats in an attempt to sell the compromise, but it remains to be seen if he will face firm opposition as he did with Senate Democrats. The sense of disappointment with the president's decision is strong, and some believe that a deadlock could have been avoided without conceding to the Republicans. END OF SUMMARY.
