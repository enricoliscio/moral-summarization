SUMMARY: Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned of a potential double-dip recession if the tax deal announced by President Obama fails to pass. The Obama administration is pushing back against criticism from fellow Democrats, who argue that the president has caved to Republicans. Obama disputed that Democrats feel betrayed and emphasized the need for Congress to examine the facts and engage in a thorough debate, with the American people expecting action. The White House has sought to quell the uproar from liberals, circulating endorsements and supportive statements from economists and Democratic officeholders. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to sell the compromise, but faced opposition from some who called the deal fiscally irresponsible and unfair. Despite the administration's efforts, about 30 Democratic senators remain firmly opposed, and some House Democrats expressed disappointment and a sense of coercion.
