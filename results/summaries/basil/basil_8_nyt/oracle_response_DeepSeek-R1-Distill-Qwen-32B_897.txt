Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The user wants a concise summary, under 200 words, using as many of those words as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about Larry Summers warning about a double-dip recession if the tax deal isn't passed. Obama is defending the deal against criticism from Democrats, saying it makes sense. Biden is meeting with House Democrats to push the deal. The White House is using economic forecasts and endorsements to support the deal, but there's a lot of outrage from liberals. Some lawmakers are firmly against it, and there's a strong sense of disappointment.

I need to make sure to include words like failure, increase, recession, done, action, choose, helping, conflagration, screwed, extended, create, outrage, back, won, vote. I'll structure the summary to cover Summers' warning, Obama's defense, Biden's efforts, the administration's support, and the opposition from Democrats. I'll keep each sentence tight and include the moral terms where appropriate.

Let me start by mentioning Summers' warning about failure leading to a recession. Then, Obama's stance on the deal making sense and the need for action. Next, Biden's meetings with Democrats to sell the deal. Then, the administration's use of economic forecasts to create support. Finally, the outrage from liberals and the opposition within Congress.

I should check that I'm not exceeding 200 words. Let me count as I go. Each sentence is concise, so it should fit. I'll make sure to include all the necessary moral terms without making it sound forced.

Okay, putting it all together now. Make sure each point flows logically and includes the key moral words. That should cover the summary effectively.

SUMMARY: Larry Summers warned that failing to pass the tax deal would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. President Obama defended the deal, stating it makes sense and urging Congress to act. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to sell the compromise, while the administration highlighted endorsements from economists and analysts to create support. However, outrage from liberals and Democratic lawmakers persists, with many firmly opposed to the deal. Some lawmakers, like Representative Peter Welch, called it "fiscally irresponsible" and urged Obama not to back down. The administrationâ€™s efforts to extend the tax cuts and help working Americans were contrasted with fears of a conflagration if the deal fails. Economists projected the deal could create jobs and boost growth, but critics argued it was a steep price for the middle class. The debate over whether to vote for the deal remains contentious, with some lawmakers refusing to coerce support. END OF SUMMARY.
