Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Larry Summers and the Obama administration's tax deal, and the moral words they used are listed. 

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. Larry Summers warns that failing to pass the tax deal increases the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration is pushing back against criticism from Democrats who think Obama caved to Republicans. Obama and Biden are trying to convince Congress, especially House Democrats, to support the deal. They're using economic projections to argue it's beneficial, but there's a lot of outrage from the left, with many Democrats opposing the deal.

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally framed words: failure, increase, recession, done, action, choose, helping, conflagration, screwed, extended, create, outrage, back, won, vote.

I'll start by mentioning Summers' warning about failure leading to increased recession risk. Then, the administration's push against criticism, using words like "failure" and "action." Obama's emphasis on the need for Congress to act, using "done" and "action." Biden's role in selling the compromise, using "helping" and "create." The administration's PR efforts with economic projections, using "create" and "extended." The outrage from the left, using "outrage," "back," and "vote." Finally, the internal opposition with some lawmakers refusing to vote for the deal.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of those moral words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the warning, then the administration's response, their arguments, the opposition, and the internal dissent.

Let me draft this, making sure each sentence incorporates the necessary moral terms where appropriate.
