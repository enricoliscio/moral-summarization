SUMMARY:

Outgoing National Economic Council Chairman Larry Summers warned that failing to pass the tax deal announced by President Obama would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration is pushing back against criticism from Democrats that the president has caved too much to Republicans. President Obama disputed that Democrats feel betrayed by the deal, saying that it makes sense and urging Congress to examine the agreement and have a thorough debate. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is meeting with House Democrats to sell the compromise, as the administration tries to quell the uproar among liberals. The White House is circulating statements of support from economic forecasters, liberal and conservative analysts, and Democratic officeholders. Despite the efforts, many Democrats remain opposed to the deal, with close to three dozen House Democrats signing a letter calling it "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair."

END OF SUMMARY.
