SUMMARY:

The Obama administration is facing strong criticism from fellow Democrats over the tax deal with Congressional Republicans, with many feeling betrayed by the president's compromise. However, Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failure to pass the package would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. President Obama emphasized the importance of passing the deal, citing economists' upwardly revised forecasts for growth and the potential creation of 1.6 million jobs. The administration is pushing back against criticism, circulating endorsements from private-sector economic forecasters, liberal analysts, and Democratic officeholders. Despite this, many House Democrats remain strongly opposed to the deal, calling it "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." The moral framing of the article suggests that the administration is prioritizing economic growth and job creation over the concerns of its liberal base, and that failure to pass the deal would have serious consequences for the economy.
