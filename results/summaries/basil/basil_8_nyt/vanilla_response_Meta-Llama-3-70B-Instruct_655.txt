SUMMARY:

Outgoing National Economic Council Chairman Larry Summers warned that failing to pass the tax deal announced by President Obama would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration is pushing back against criticism from fellow Democrats that the president has caved too much to Republicans. President Obama emphasized the importance of passing the deal, citing economists' upwardly revised growth forecasts. Vice President Joe Biden met with House Democrats to sell the compromise, while the White House circulated supportive statements from economic forecasters, liberal analysts, and Democratic officeholders. Despite this, many Democrats remain opposed to the deal, with close to three dozen House Democrats signing a letter calling it "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair."

END OF SUMMARY.
