SUMMARY: The Obama administration is facing criticism from fellow Democrats over the president's recent tax deal with Congressional Republicans. Larry Summers, the outgoing National Economic Council chairman, warned that failing to pass a similar package would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to sell the compromise, while the White House circulated endorsements from economists and Democratic leaders to counter the criticism. David Axelrod, Obama's chief political adviser, argued that middle-class Americans would suffer if their tax cuts were not extended. However, close to three dozen House Democrats have signed a letter calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and some Democratic lawmakers remain disappointed with the president's decision. Despite the pushback, the administration continues to emphasize the potential economic benefits of the deal, citing projections of increased economic growth and job creation.
END OF SUMMARY.
