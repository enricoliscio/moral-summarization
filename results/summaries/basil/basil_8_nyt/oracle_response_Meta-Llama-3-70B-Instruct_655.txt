SUMMARY:

Larry Summers, outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failing to pass the tax deal announced by President Obama would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration is pushing back against criticism from fellow Democrats that the president has caved too much to Republicans. President Obama emphasized the importance of taking action, saying that "the American people are watching, and they're expecting action on our parts." He urged Congress to examine the agreement and have a thorough debate, but ultimately get it done.

The White House is working to quell the uproar among liberals about the tax deal, with Vice President Biden meeting with House Democrats to sell the compromise. The administration is highlighting endorsements from economic forecasters, liberal analysts, and Democratic officeholders, who agree that the deal will help working Americans and increase economic growth.

However, many Democrats remain outraged, calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." They argue that the president should not back down and that they won't vote for it. The sense of disappointment with the president remains strong, with many feeling that they're being coerced into supporting a bad deal.

END OF SUMMARY.
