Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warning that failing to pass the tax deal would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration is pushing back against criticism from Democrats who feel the president caved to Republicans. Obama is defending the deal, saying it makes sense and that Congress should examine it thoroughly. Biden is meeting with House Democrats to sell the compromise. The White House is using endorsements from economists and others to support the deal, but there's a lot of opposition from liberals, including many House Democrats who signed a letter calling it irresponsible. Some senators are firmly opposed, and Biden's meetings are contentious.

Now, the moral framing seems to be about the administration's effort to justify the tax deal despite criticism, emphasizing the economic benefits and the need for action. They're countering the opposition by highlighting support from various quarters, but there's significant pushback from within their own party.

I need to make sure the summary captures this dynamic: the administration's arguments for the deal, the opposition from Democrats, and the economic stakes involved. I should keep it under 200 words and use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

Let me structure it: start with Summers' warning, mention the administration's response to criticism, Obama's defense, Biden's efforts, the White House's PR campaign with endorsements, and the opposition from liberals and specific lawmakers. Conclude with the ongoing debate and economic stakes.

I should ensure that the moral aspects are clearâ€”like the administration's emphasis on the necessity of the deal for the economy versus the criticism for caving in to Republicans, and the internal party conflict.

I need to be concise, so I'll combine points where possible and avoid getting bogged down in too many details. Make sure it's a coherent flow from the warning to the administration's actions, the opposition, and the implications.

Alright, let me draft the summary now, keeping it within the word limit and the required structure.
