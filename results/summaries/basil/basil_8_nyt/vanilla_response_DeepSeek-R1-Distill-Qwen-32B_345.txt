Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warning that failing to pass a tax deal could lead to a double-dip recession. He made these remarks with Robert Gibbs and David Axelrod. The administration is defending the deal against criticism from Democrats who think Obama conceded too much to Republicans. Obama himself said that more people will see the deal makes sense and urged Congress to act. He mentioned that economists have revised their growth forecasts upward after the tax deal was announced.

Vice President Biden is meeting with House Democrats to sell the compromise. The White House is circulating endorsements from various economists and politicians to support the deal. They're highlighting positive projections, like Mark Zandi's estimate of 1.25% growth and 1.6 million jobs. However, there's a lot of opposition from liberal Democrats and interest groups. Over 30 House Democrats signed a letter calling the deal irresponsible and unfair. Biden's meetings with senators and representatives are contentious, with many still opposing the deal. Barney Frank, a Democratic representative, said he won't vote for it and doesn't feel coerced.

So, the summary should include the key points: Summers' warning, the administration's defense, Obama's comments, Biden's efforts, the White House's PR campaign with endorsements, the positive economic projections, and the significant opposition from within the Democratic party. I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed.
