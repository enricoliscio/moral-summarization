SUMMARY: Larry Summers, Chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failing to pass President Obama's tax deal could lead to a double-dip recession. The administration has been pushing back against criticism from Democrats, arguing that the deal will boost economic growth and create jobs. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to sell the compromise, emphasizing endorsements from economists and analysts. However, many Democrats remain firmly opposed to the deal, calling it fiscally irresponsible and expressing outrage over the president's concessions to Republicans. The sense of disappointment and coercion among Democrats is strong, with some refusing to back down or feel coerced into supporting the deal. The administration's message machine is working overtime to garner support, but it remains to be seen if they will succeed in getting the deal passed.
END OF SUMMARY.
