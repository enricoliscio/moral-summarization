Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Larry Summers and the Obama administration pushing for a tax deal to avoid a double-dip recession. There's a lot of details here, so I should focus on the main points.

First, the administration is emphasizing the risk of not passing the tax deal, citing economists and job creation. They're trying to counter criticism from Democrats who feel betrayed. I should note that Summers and Obama are making these points to push for the deal.

Next, the administration is using endorsements from various sources, including economists and even a freshman House member, to build support. This shows they're trying to gather as much backing as possible.

On the flip side, there's significant opposition from within the Democratic party. Many House and Senate Democrats are opposing the deal, calling it unfair and fiscally irresponsible. This internal conflict is a key part of the moral framing, showing the tension within the party.

I should also mention Biden's role in trying to sell the deal to lawmakers, which adds to the narrative of the administration's efforts to push through the legislation despite opposition.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include the main points: the administration's push, the economic arguments, the endorsements, and the internal Democratic opposition. I'll structure it to highlight the struggle between the administration's rationale and the party's internal dissent.

SUMMARY: Larry Summers, outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failing to pass President Obama's tax deal would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration is countering criticism from Democrats who argue Obama conceded too much to Republicans. Obama defended the deal, stating it makes sense and urging Congress to act. Vice President Biden is meeting with House Democrats to promote the compromise, while the White House is circulating endorsements from economists and Democratic officials to build support. However, many Democrats, including Representatives Peter Welch and Barney Frank, are opposing the deal, calling it "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." The administration faces internal opposition, with about 30 Democratic senators and dozens of House members firmly against the deal. The White House highlights economic projections suggesting the tax deal will boost growth and create jobs, but its PR campaign is meeting strong resistance from its base. END OF SUMMARY.
