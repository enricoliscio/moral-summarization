SUMMARY: Despite facing criticism and outrage from fellow Democrats, President Obama stood firm on his negotiated tax deal with Congressional Republicans, arguing that it made sense economically and would help Americans. The deal aimed to prevent a double-dip recession and boost economic growth and job creation. Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned of the increased risk of recession without such a package. The White House pushed back against criticism, citing support from economists, analysts, and Democratic officeholders. Vice President Biden also played a key role in liaising with Congress. However, some House Democrats, including Representative Barney Frank, remained disappointed and felt coerced by the deal, refusing to vote for it. The administration's message of helping working Americans and creating jobs was met with resistance from liberal members of Congress and interest groups on the left.
END OF SUMMARY.
