Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Larry Summers and the tax deal. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts with Larry Summers warning about the risk of a double-dip recession if the tax deal isn't passed. He made these remarks with Robert Gibbs and David Axelrod. The administration is pushing back against criticism from Democrats who think Obama gave in too much to Republicans.

Obama himself disputed the idea that Democrats feel betrayed, saying the deal makes sense. He emphasized the importance of Congress acting quickly. The administration is trying to get support by citing economists who revised their growth forecasts positively after the tax deal.

Vice President Biden is meeting with House Democrats to sell the deal, which has caused some controversy. The White House is using endorsements from various economists and Democratic officials to counter criticism. However, many Democrats, including Representatives like Peter Welch and Barney Frank, are upset, calling the deal irresponsible and unfair. Some are firmly opposed and won't vote for it.

So, the summary needs to capture the key points: Summers' warning, administration's defense, Obama's stance, Biden's efforts, the mixed reactions from Democrats, and the economic projections supporting the deal.

I should make sure to include all these elements concisely, keeping it under 200 words. I'll structure it to first mention the warning, then the administration's response, followed by the opposition and economic arguments.

SUMMARY: Larry Summers, outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failing to pass President Obama's tax deal would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration is countering criticism from Democrats who argue Obama conceded too much to Republicans. Obama defended the deal, emphasizing its importance and urging Congress to act quickly. Vice President Biden is meeting with House Democrats to promote the compromise, while the White House is circulating endorsements from economists and Democratic officials to build support. However, many Democrats, including Representatives Peter Welch and Barney Frank, are strongly opposed, calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." Some senators remain firmly against the agreement, despite Biden's efforts. The administration highlights positive economic projections, but its messaging faces backlash from its liberal base. END OF SUMMARY.
