SUMMARY:
President Obama's tax deal with Congressional Republicans has sparked outrage among his liberal base, with many Democrats feeling betrayed by the compromise. Outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, Larry Summers, warned that failure to pass the deal would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. Despite criticism, Obama emphasized that the deal makes sense and urged Congress to examine the agreement and have a thorough debate. The White House launched a public relations offensive, circulating statements of support from economists, analysts, and Democratic officeholders. However, close to three dozen House Democrats signed a letter calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met with House Democrats to sell the compromise, but many remained firmly opposed. The deal has been met with public expressions of outrage, with some Democrats refusing to vote for it, feeling they should not be coerced.
