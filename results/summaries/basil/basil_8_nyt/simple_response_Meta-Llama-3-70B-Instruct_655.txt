SUMMARY:

Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failing to pass the tax deal announced by President Obama would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration is pushing back against criticism from fellow Democrats that the president has caved too much to Republicans. President Obama emphasized that the deal makes sense and urged Congress to examine the agreement and have a thorough debate. The White House is circulating statements of support from economic forecasters, liberal and conservative analysts, and Democratic officeholders to counter condemnations from some Democrats in Congress. Despite the public relations offensive, the administration's base is expressing outrage, with close to three dozen House Democrats signing a letter calling the tax deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." The moral framing of the article suggests that the administration is prioritizing economic growth and helping working Americans over partisan politics, but is facing criticism from its own base for compromising too much with Republicans.
