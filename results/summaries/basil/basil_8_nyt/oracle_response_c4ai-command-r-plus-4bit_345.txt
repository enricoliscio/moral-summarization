SUMMARY: In a bid to avoid failure and increase action, President Obama and his administration are pushing for the passage of a tax deal with Republicans. The deal, which has been criticized by some Democrats as a cave-in to the Republicans, is being defended by the President and his advisers, who argue that it will help create jobs and boost economic growth. They are choosing to help working Americans and avoid a double-dip recession, despite the risk of outrage from the President's base. The White House is working done to quell the uproar, with Vice President Biden meeting with House Democrats to sell the compromise. However, some Democrats remain firmly opposed to the deal, feeling betrayed and coerced. The administration is emphasizing the support of economists and other analysts who project that the deal will increase growth and create jobs. Despite these efforts, expressions of disappointment and betrayal from the President's base continue, with close to three dozen House Democrats signing a letter calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." The administration is urging Congress to extend the middle-class tax cuts and get the deal voted on, emphasizing that the American people are expecting action and will not be coerced.
END OF SUMMARY.
