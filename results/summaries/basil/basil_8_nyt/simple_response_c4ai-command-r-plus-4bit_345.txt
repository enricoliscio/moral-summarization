SUMMARY: The Obama administration is facing backlash from fellow Democrats and liberal interest groups over the president's recent tax deal with Congressional Republicans. Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failing to pass such a package would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration has been defending the deal, arguing that it will boost economic growth and create jobs. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to sell the compromise, but many remain opposed, calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." Despite the criticism, the White House has been circulating endorsements from economic forecasters and Democratic officeholders, and emphasizing the potential benefits for the middle class. The administration is facing a difficult task in trying to quell the outrage from its own party, with many Democrats feeling betrayed by the president's compromise with Republicans.
