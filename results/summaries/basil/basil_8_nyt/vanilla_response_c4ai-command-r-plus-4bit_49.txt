SUMMARY: The Obama administration faced criticism from fellow Democrats for the president's tax deal with Republicans. Larry Summers, the outgoing National Economic Council chairman, warned that failing to pass the package could lead to a double-dip recession. The White House pushed back against the criticism, emphasizing the deal's potential for boosting economic growth and job creation. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to sell the compromise, while the White House circulated endorsements from economists and Democratic officials. However, some House Democrats, including Representative Welch, signed a letter calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible." Despite the pushback, about 30 Democratic senators remained opposed to the deal, and Representative Frank expressed his disappointment with the president's decision. END OF SUMMARY.
