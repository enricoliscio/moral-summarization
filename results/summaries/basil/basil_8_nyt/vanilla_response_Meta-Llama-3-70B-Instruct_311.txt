SUMMARY:

Outgoing National Economic Council Chairman Larry Summers warned that failing to pass the tax deal announced by President Obama would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration is pushing back against criticism from Democrats that the president has conceded too much to Republicans. President Obama disputed that Democrats feel betrayed by the deal, saying that it makes sense and urging Congress to examine the agreement and take action. Vice President Joe Biden met with House Democrats to sell the compromise, as the White House circulated statements of support from economists, analysts, and Democratic officeholders. Despite this, many Democrats, including liberal members of Congress and interest groups, expressed outrage, calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." Over 30 Democratic senators and many House Democrats remain opposed to the deal.

END OF SUMMARY.
