SUMMARY:
President Obama's tax deal with Congressional Republicans has sparked outrage among liberal Democrats, who feel he has caved too much to Republicans and betrayed their trust. Outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, Larry Summers, warned that failure to pass the package would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. Despite criticism, Obama emphasized that the deal makes sense and urged Congress to examine the agreement and have a thorough debate. The White House launched a public relations offensive, circulating endorsements from economists, analysts, and Democratic officeholders, including liberal supporters. However, close to three dozen House Democrats signed a letter calling the tax deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair," and many remain firmly opposed to the president's negotiated deal.
