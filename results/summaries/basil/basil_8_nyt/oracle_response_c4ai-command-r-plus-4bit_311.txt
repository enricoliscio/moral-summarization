SUMMARY: Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failure to pass a package like the tax deal negotiated by President Obama and Congressional Republicans would heighten the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration has been pushing back against criticism from fellow Democrats, arguing that the deal will boost economic growth and create jobs. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to sell the compromise, while the White House circulated endorsements from economists and Democratic officials. However, the deal has faced strong opposition from liberal members of Congress and interest groups on the left, who view it as fiscally irresponsible and unfair. Close to three dozen House Democrats have signed a letter expressing their outrage and vowing to not back down. Despite the administration's efforts, about 30 Democratic senators remain firmly opposed to the deal, and Representative Barney Frank has stated his intention not to vote for it. The sense of disappointment with the president's decision remains strong among Democrats.
END OF SUMMARY.
