SUMMARY: The Obama administration is facing backlash from fellow Democrats for its tax deal with Republicans, with some calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." Despite this, Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, argued that failure to pass such a package would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration has been pushing back against criticism, emphasizing the potential economic benefits of the deal and the support it has received from economists and Democratic officeholders. Vice President Biden has been serving as the liaison with Congress, trying to sell the compromise to House Democrats. However, close to three dozen House Democrats have signed a letter expressing their disapproval, and many Democratic senators remain firmly opposed to the deal. The sense of disappointment and outrage among Obama's base is strong, with some feeling coerced and betrayed by the president's decision to cave to Republican demands. The administration is urging Congress to take action and choose what is best for helping Americans, warning that failure to extend the tax cuts would screw over the middle class.
END OF SUMMARY.
