SUMMARY: Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned of the risks of a double-dip recession if a tax deal like the one announced by President Obama is not passed. The administration has been pushing back hard against criticism from Democrats, who feel betrayed by the president's deal with Republicans. Obama emphatically disputed that Democrats generally feel betrayed and called for Congress to act, stating that the American people are watching and expecting action. The administration's message machine has been churning out statements of support, but this public relations offensive is met with outrage from the president's base, including liberal members of Congress. Vice President Biden has been serving as the liaison-in-chief, but his visit with House Democrats is expected to be contentious, as many remain firmly opposed to the deal. Despite the administration's efforts, disappointment and a sense of betrayal among Democrats persist. Representative Barney Frank stated that he will not vote for the deal, refusing to be coerced. END OF SUMMARY.
