SUMMARY: The Obama administration is facing criticism from fellow Democrats for the president's recent tax deal with Republicans. Larry Summers, the outgoing National Economic Council chairman, warned that failing to pass the package would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. Vice President Biden met with House Democrats to sell the compromise, while the White House circulated statements of support from various sources. However, close to three dozen House Democrats have signed a letter calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible." Democratic lawmakers expressed their disappointment with the president, feeling that they should not be coerced into supporting the deal. Despite the pushback, the administration maintains that the deal will boost economic growth and create jobs.
END OF SUMMARY.
