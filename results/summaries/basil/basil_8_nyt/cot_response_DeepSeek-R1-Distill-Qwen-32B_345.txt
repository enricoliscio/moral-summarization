Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Larry Summers and the Obama administration's response to the tax deal and the criticism from Democrats. 

The user wants two things: first, to identify all the single words that are morally framed, and second, to write a summary that includes as many of those words as possible. 

Starting with STEP 1, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "failure," "risk," "betrayed," "cave," "screws," "fiscally irresponsible," "grossly unfair," "back down," "conflagration," "compromise," "betrayal," "screwed," "disappointment," and "coerced" stand out as having moral implications. These words are used to convey approval or disapproval of actions or decisions.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into about 200 words, making sure to include these moral terms. The summary should highlight the administration's efforts to justify the tax deal despite criticism, the reactions from Democrats, and the economic implications. I'll structure it to show the administration's stance and the opposing views, using the identified moral words to maintain the original framing.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the administration's position, followed by the criticism, and ending with the ongoing debate. I'll also make sure to mention key figures like Biden and the economists' projections to provide context.

Let me put it all together, making sure to stay within the word limit and include all the necessary moral terms without making the summary too cluttered. I'll check that each sentence contributes to the overall picture and that the moral framing is clear.

**SUMMARY:**  
Larry Summers warned that failing to pass the tax deal would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. President Obama defended the deal, emphasizing its economic benefits and urging Congress to act. However, many Democrats criticized the deal, calling it "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair," accusing Obama of caving to Republicans. Vice President Biden and administration officials, including David Axelrod, have been working to sell the compromise, highlighting endorsements from economists and Democratic figures. Despite this, liberal members of Congress remain firmly opposed, with some calling the deal a "steep price" and urging Obama not to back down. The administration’s efforts to quell opposition have been met with outrage, as many Democrats feel betrayed by the compromise. The debate over the tax deal continues, with economic projections showing potential job creation and growth, but criticism from Obama’s base persists. END OF SUMMARY.
