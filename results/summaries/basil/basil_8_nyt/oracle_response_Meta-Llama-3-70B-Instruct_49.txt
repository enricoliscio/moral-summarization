SUMMARY:

Larry Summers, outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failing to pass the tax deal would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. President Obama disputed claims that Democrats feel betrayed by the deal, saying it makes sense and urging Congress to take action. The administration is pushing back against criticism, citing endorsements from economists and Democratic officeholders. However, many Democrats remain outraged, calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." Vice President Biden is trying to sell the compromise to House Democrats, but many remain opposed, feeling they should not be coerced into voting for it. The administration's message machine is highlighting the deal's potential to create 1.6 million jobs and increase economic growth, but critics argue that it's a "steep price" to pay. The debate has sparked a sense of moral urgency, with both sides calling for action and warning of the consequences of inaction.
