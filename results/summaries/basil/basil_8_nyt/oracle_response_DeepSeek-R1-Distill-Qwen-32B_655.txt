Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Larry Summers and the Obama administration's tax deal and the reactions to it. The author used specific morally charged words like failure, recession, action, choose, helping, conflagration, screwed, create, outrage, back, won, vote. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Larry Summers warns that not passing the tax deal increases the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration is countering criticism from Democrats who think Obama gave too much to Republicans. Obama defends the deal, saying it makes sense and urges Congress to act. Biden is meeting with House Democrats to sell the deal. The White House is using endorsements from economists and others to support the deal. They also highlight job creation and economic growth projections. However, there's significant outrage from liberals and some Democrats oppose the deal, with many vowing not to vote for it.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary, using as many of the listed words as possible without making it too long. I should structure it to show the administration's stance, the criticism, and the consequences of not passing the deal.

I'll start by mentioning Summers' warning about failure to pass the deal increasing recession risk. Then, note Obama's defense and the administration's efforts with Biden and the endorsements. Highlight the projected job creation and economic growth. Then, address the outrage and opposition from Democrats, including their refusal to vote.

I need to make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate. Words like 'failure' in the context of not passing the deal, 'increase' the risk,'recession,' 'action' needed, 'choose' to help,'screwed' if tax cuts aren't extended, 'create' jobs, 'outrage' from the base, 'back' the deal, 'won' support, 'vote' against.

Putting it all together, I'll make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the warning, moving to the administration's efforts, the positive projections, and ending with the opposition and their stance.

I should also keep the summary under 200 words. Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll aim for clarity and conciseness while including all necessary elements and the moral framing words.

SUMMARY: Larry Summers warned that failing to pass the tax deal would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. President Obama defended the deal, emphasizing the need for action and urging Congress to examine it thoroughly. Vice President Biden is meeting with House Democrats to promote the compromise, while the White House highlights endorsements and projections of job creation and economic growth. However, the deal faces outrage from liberals and Democratic opposition, with some lawmakers vowing not to vote for it, arguing it is fiscally irresponsible and unfair. The administration's efforts to back the deal and create jobs contrast with criticism that it was a steep price to help working Americans over political conflict. END OF SUMMARY.
