SUMMARY:
The Obama administration is facing criticism from fellow Democrats over the tax deal with Congressional Republicans, with some feeling "betrayed" and arguing that the president has "caved" too much. Outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council Larry Summers warned that failure to pass the package would "significantly increase the risk" of a double-dip recession. President Obama defended the deal, saying it "makes sense" and that "economists across the country have upwardly revised their forecasts for growth" after the announcement. However, many Democrats remain opposed, calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair". Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is trying to sell the compromise to House Democrats, but many are still unhappy, with some saying they would not vote for it, feeling they should not be "coerced" into supporting a deal that would leave middle-class Americans "screwed". END OF SUMMARY.
