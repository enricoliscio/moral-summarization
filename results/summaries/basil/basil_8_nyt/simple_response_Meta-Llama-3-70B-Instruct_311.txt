SUMMARY:

The Obama administration is pushing back against criticism from fellow Democrats that the president has caved too much to Republicans in the tax deal announced this week. Outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, Larry Summers, warned that failure to pass the package would significantly increase the risk of a double-dip recession. President Obama emphasized that the deal makes sense and urged Congress to examine the agreement and have a thorough debate. The administration is circulating statements of support from economic forecasters, liberal and conservative analysts, and Democratic officeholders to counter condemnations from some Democrats in Congress. However, many Democrats, including liberal members of Congress and spokesmen for interest groups on the left, have expressed outrage, calling the deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." The moral framing of the article suggests that the administration's decision to compromise with Republicans is a pragmatic and responsible choice, while the criticism from Democrats is seen as ideological and potentially harmful to the economy.
