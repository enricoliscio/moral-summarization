SUMMARY:

The Obama administration is pushing back against criticism from fellow Democrats that the president has caved too much to Republicans in the tax deal. Outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, Larry Summers, warned that failure to pass the package would increase the risk of a double-dip recession. President Obama emphasized that the deal makes sense and urged Congress to examine the agreement and have a thorough debate. The administration is circulating statements of support from economic forecasters, liberal and conservative analysts, and Democratic officeholders to counter condemnations from some Democrats in Congress. However, many liberal members of Congress and spokesmen for interest groups on the left have expressed outrage, calling the tax deal "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair." The moral framing of the article suggests that the administration is prioritizing economic growth and helping working Americans over partisan politics, but is facing opposition from its own base who feel betrayed by the compromise.
