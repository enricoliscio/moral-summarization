Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Larry Summers and the tax deal. Let me read through the article first. It's about the National Economic Council chairman warning about the risk of a double-dip recession if the tax deal isn't passed. The administration is trying to defend the deal against criticism from Democrats who think Obama gave in too much to Republicans. Obama himself says the deal makes sense and that Congress should examine it thoroughly. There's also mention of Biden meeting with House Democrats to sell the compromise. The White House is getting support from various economists and some Democrats, but there's a lot of outrage from liberal members who think the deal is bad. Some House Democrats have even signed a letter against it, calling it fiscally irresponsible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: Summers' warning, administration's defense, support from economists, and the opposition from Democrats. I should make sure to mention the possible impact on the economy and the political pushback. Let me structure it step by step, starting with Summers' remarks, then the administration's stance, followed by the support and opposition, and end with the potential economic effects. I need to keep it clear and within the word limit. Maybe I can combine some sentences to save space. Also, include that Biden is meeting with House Dems again and the mixed reactions. That should cover the main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Larry Summers, outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, warned that failing to pass the tax deal announced by President Obama could increase the risk of a double-dip recession. The administration is defending the deal against criticism from Democrats who argue Obama conceded too much to Republicans. Obama emphasized the deal's importance, stating it makes sense and urging Congress to act. Vice President Biden is meeting with House Democrats to promote the compromise. The White House highlights support from economists, projecting the deal could boost growth by 1.25 percentage points and create 1.6 million jobs. However, liberal Democrats and interest groups strongly oppose the deal, with over three dozen House members calling it "fiscally irresponsible." Some senators remain firmly against it, and Democratic lawmakers express disappointment in Obama's approach. END OF SUMMARY.
