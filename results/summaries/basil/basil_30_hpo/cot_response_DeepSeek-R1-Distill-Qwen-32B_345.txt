Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify the morally framed words as per the instructions. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation.

Looking at the text, words like "bold," "historic," "increase," "safe," "judge," "can’t," "put off," "sweeping," "reform," "dangerous," "eliminate," "obligation," "save," "monumental," "thrilled," "push," "block," "hypocrite," "cure-all," "tangible," "missing," and "comprehensive" stand out. These words carry moral weight, indicating the author's stance on the issue.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include as many of these moral terms as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of Obama's gun control proposals, the challenges, and the moral implications involved.

I'll start by outlining the main points: Obama's comprehensive proposals, the four key areas, the funding, executive actions, the administration's confidence, challenges from the NRA, and the limitations of the proposals. I'll weave in the moral words to reflect the author's framing, emphasizing the necessity and potential impact of the reforms.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, highlighting the administration's efforts, the support from advocates, the opposition from the NRA, and the recognition that the proposals aren't a complete solution. This will maintain the moral perspective presented in the original article.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Obama unveiled the most sweeping gun control proposals in a generation, emphasizing the moral obligation to protect children and reduce mass gun violence. The plan includes background checks, reinstating the assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazines, and funding school safety and mental health programs. The administration also introduced 23 executive actions to implement parts of the plan immediately. Advocates praised the effort as historic, while the NRA criticized it as overreach. The proposals aim to address gun violence comprehensively but face significant legislative and public opinion challenges. The administration acknowledges the plan isn’t a cure-all but hopes it will save lives and reduce the impact of military-style weapons. The debate over the proposals highlights the tension between public safety and gun rights, with Obama urging Americans to demand change. END OF SUMMARY.
