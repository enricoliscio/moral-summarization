SUMMARY:
President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping gun control proposal, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. The plan aims to keep children "safe" and fulfill the country's "obligation" to prevent mass gun violence. The proposal includes requiring criminal background checks, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools. The administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions, which will be taken immediately. Obama emphasized that "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The approach is "monumental" and "bold," but selling it to Congress will require "legislative craft." The gun-rights lobby has already signaled its opposition, calling the administration's effort "failed solutions." END OF SUMMARY.
