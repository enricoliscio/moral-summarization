SUMMARY: President Obama has unveiled a bold and sweepingly historic attempt to curb the increase in mass gun violence. The proposal, which comes after a month-long review process led by Vice President Biden, is divided into four key areas: law enforcement, dangerous firearms and ammunition availability, school safety, and mental health. The president's recommendations include requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, eliminating armor-piercing bullets, providing mental health services in schools, allocating funds for more police officers, and creating a federal gun trafficking statute. The cost of the package is estimated at $500 million. To immediately implement some changes, the administration is also taking 23 executive actions, such as improving training for active shooting situations and directing the CDC to research gun violence prevention. The proposal goes beyond what gun control advocates initially hoped for and faces opposition from gun-rights lobbyists like the NRA, who argue that law-abiding gun owners should not be blamed for the evil acts of criminals and madmen. The White House admits its proposals are not a cure-all for evil and mass shootings but insists they will provide law enforcement with tools to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands, stem the use of military-style weapons, and give schools and communities resources to address violence. President Obama acknowledges that public demand is crucial for the success of these proposals and urges Americans to raise their voices in support of these much-needed changes to protect the innocent and ensure the safety of our children.
