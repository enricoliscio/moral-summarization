SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping gun control proposal, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. The proposal aims to stem the increase in mass gun violence, with Obama emphasizing that "keeping our children safe" is the society's first task. The plan includes requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools. The administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions, including requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system. The approach is so sweeping that it goes beyond what most gun control advocates were hoping for. While the gun-rights lobby has signaled opposition, Obama vowed to use the full weight of his office to make the proposals a reality, urging the American people to demand change. The proposal is a monumental moment in the effort to reduce gun violence, and its success will depend on public opinion and legislative craft.
