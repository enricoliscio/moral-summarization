SUMMARY: In a historic move to curb the rising gun violence in the country, President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping set of gun control policy reforms. The proposal, broken into four key areas: law enforcement, dangerous firearms and ammunition availability, school safety, and mental health, includes background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, improving mental health services in schools, and more. The estimated cost of the package is $500 million. To immediately implement some changes, Obama also announced 23 executive actions, such as better training for active shooting situations and research on gun violence prevention. The proposal goes beyond initial expectations and has received support from gun control advocates. However, the NRA has criticized the administration's efforts and will likely try to block the proposals. The White House admits that the measures are not a complete solution but insists that they will provide law enforcement with needed tools and resources for schools and communities to address violence. The article also questions why it took the administration so long to propose these reforms.
