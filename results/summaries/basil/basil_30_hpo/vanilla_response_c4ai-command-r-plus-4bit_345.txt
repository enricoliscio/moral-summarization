SUMMARY: President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping set of gun control policy proposals on Wednesday, marking the most ambitious effort to curb gun violence in a generation. The plan includes four key areas: law enforcement, availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health. Obama's proposal includes requiring background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, and improving mental health services in schools. The cost of the package is estimated at $500 million. In addition to the legislative proposals, Obama announced 23 executive actions that will be implemented immediately, such as improving training for active shooting situations and directing the CDC to research gun violence. The NRA has criticized the administration's efforts and plans to block the proposals. The White House acknowledges that the proposals are not a cure-all but insists they will provide law enforcement with needed tools and resources to address gun violence. The plan is a result of a month-long review process led by Vice President Joe Biden and includes input from various organizations and elected officials. Obama called on the American people to demand action from Congress and pledged to use the weight of his office to push for the proposals.
