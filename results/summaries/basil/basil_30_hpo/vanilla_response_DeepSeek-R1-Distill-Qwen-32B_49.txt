Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about Obama's gun control proposals. The user wants the summary to be concise, no more than 200 words, and it should follow specific formatting instructions. 

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main points. The key elements include the unveiling of the proposals, the four main areas they cover (law enforcement, firearm availability, school safety, mental health), specific measures like background checks and bans on certain firearms, the cost, and the executive actions. Also, there's mention of the administration's efforts to push these through Congress, reactions from gun control advocates and the NRA, and the limitations of the proposals.

I need to condense all this information into a coherent summary. I'll start by stating that Obama introduced comprehensive gun control measures after a month of review. Then, I'll list the main components of the proposals, the cost, and the immediate executive actions. I should also mention the potential challenges, such as opposition from the NRA and the need for public support. Finally, I'll note that the proposals aren't a complete solution but aim to address some critical issues.

I'll make sure to keep each sentence concise and avoid unnecessary details. I'll also ensure that the summary flows logically, covering the introduction, the measures, the costs, the actions, the reactions, and the limitations. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll focus on the most important aspects without getting bogged down in specifics.

After drafting, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that it accurately reflects the article's content. I'll also check that the formatting requirements are met, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY:  
President Barack Obama unveiled comprehensive gun control proposals, marking the most significant legislative effort in decades. The initiative, following a month-long review by Vice President Joe Biden, includes four key areas: law enforcement, firearm availability, school safety, and mental health. Key measures include universal background checks, reinstating an assault weapons ban, limiting magazine capacity, banning armor-piercing bullets, and funding school safety programs. The $500 million plan requires congressional approval, but Obama also announced 23 immediate executive actions, such as improving background check data and training for law enforcement. Gun control advocates praised the proposal, while the NRA criticized it as overreach. The administration emphasized the need for public support to push the measures through Congress. While the proposals aim to reduce gun violence, they do not address existing firearms and are not a complete solution.  

END OF SUMMARY.
