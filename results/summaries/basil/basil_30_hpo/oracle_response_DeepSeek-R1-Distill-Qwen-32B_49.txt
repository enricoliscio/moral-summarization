Alright, I need to summarize the news article about Obama's gun control proposals while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Obama introduced comprehensive gun control measures after a month-long review. The proposals include background checks, assault weapons ban, magazine limits, mental health services, school safety, and more. The administration is also taking executive actions alongside these proposals.

Next, I need to identify the key moral elements. Words like "stem," "increase," "violence," "keeping," "saved," "demand," "push," "act," "ban," "limit," "provide," "prevent," "improve," and "address" are crucial. These words highlight the moral imperative to reduce violence and protect communities.

I should structure the summary to include these terms. Start by stating the main goal: stemming gun violence. Mention the components of the proposal, using terms like "background checks," "ban," "limit," and "mental health services." Highlight the administration's efforts to push these measures, the demand for public support, and the improvements over past policies.

I also need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the key points without going into too much detail. The tone should reflect the moral urgency, emphasizing the importance of the proposals in saving lives and preventing future tragedies.

Finally, I'll ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the introduction of the proposals, their components, the administration's efforts, and the moral call to action for public support. This approach will effectively capture the essence of the article while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: President Obama unveiled comprehensive gun control proposals to stem the increase in mass gun violence, emphasizing the moral obligation to protect communities. The plan includes requiring universal background checks, reinstating an assault weapons ban, limiting magazine capacity, and providing mental health services in schools. The administration is supplementing its legislative recommendations with 23 executive actions, such as improving training for law enforcement and directing research on gun violence prevention. Obama stressed the urgency, stating, "If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The proposal aims to address school safety, mental health, and law enforcement, while also targeting illegal gun trafficking. However, the administration acknowledges it won't solve all gun violence issues, focusing instead on preventing future tragedies. The plan faces challenges, including opposition from gun-rights groups, but Obama urged the American people to demand change. The proposals reflect a long-overdue effort to improve public safety and reduce violence. END OF SUMMARY.
