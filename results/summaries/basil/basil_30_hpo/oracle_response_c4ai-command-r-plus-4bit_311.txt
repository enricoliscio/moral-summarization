SUMMARY: In a bold move to stem the increase in mass gun violence, President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping set of proposals for gun control policy reform. The proposals are broken down into four key areas: law enforcement, availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health. Obama recommended requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, and eliminating armor-piercing bullets. He also proposed providing mental health services in schools and allocating funds for hiring more police officers. The cost of the package is estimated at $500 million. To supplement the proposals, 23 executive actions will be taken immediately, including improving training for active shooting situations and directing the CDC to research gun violence prevention. The approach is comprehensive and goes beyond what gun control advocates initially hoped for. However, selling the proposals on Capitol Hill will require legislative craft. The gun-rights lobby has already signaled its opposition to the administration's efforts, claiming that law-abiding gun owners should not be blamed for the acts of criminals and madmen. The White House admits that the proposals are not a cure-all, but insists that they will provide law enforcement with needed mechanisms to prevent illegal weapon transfers and give schools and communities resources to address violence. The question remains: what took the administration so long to propose these measures?
