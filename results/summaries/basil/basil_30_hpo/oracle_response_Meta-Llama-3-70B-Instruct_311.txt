SUMMARY: President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping gun control proposal to stem the increase in mass gun violence, emphasizing that "keeping our children safe" is society's first task. The proposal aims to prevent gun violence by requiring criminal background checks, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools. The administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions, including requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system and directing the Centers for Disease Control to research the causes and prevention of gun violence. Obama emphasized that "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The proposal's cost is estimated to be around $500 million. While the gun-rights lobby has already signaled opposition, Obama urged the American people to demand change, saying "we are going to need voices in those areas and congressional districts where the tradition of gun ownership is strong."
