SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama has unveiled a comprehensive gun control proposal, the most sweeping effort in a generation, to address the increase in mass gun violence. The proposal includes four key subsections: law enforcement, availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health. Recommendations include requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools. The package also includes 23 executive actions that will be taken immediately. The cost of the package is estimated to be around $500 million. The administration acknowledges that selling the proposal on the Hill will require legislative craft, and the president is willing to work with lawmakers to move the process forward. The gun-rights lobby has already signaled opposition to the proposal, but the administration is hopeful that public demand will drive change.
