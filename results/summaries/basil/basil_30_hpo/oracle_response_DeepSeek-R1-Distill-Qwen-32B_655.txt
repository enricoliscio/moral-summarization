Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. 

The article discusses Obama's gun control proposals, which are the most comprehensive in a generation. He emphasizes the importance of keeping children safe and preventing violence. The proposals include background checks, assault weapons bans, magazine limits, mental health services, and school safety measures. The cost is around $500 million, with some funds from the budget. The administration is also taking 23 executive actions, like data sharing and training. 

I need to make sure the summary includes words like "stem," "increase," "violence," "keeping," "provide," "allocate," etc. I should structure the summary to highlight the key points: the proposals, their components, the funding, executive actions, and the challenges ahead, like opposition from the NRA and the need for public support. 

I'll start by stating the main action, then outline the four key areas. I'll mention the funding and executive actions, followed by the administration's stance and the opposition. Finally, I'll note the challenges and the call for public involvement. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay within 200 words.

SUMMARY: President Obama unveiled sweeping gun control proposals, marking the most significant legislative effort in a generation to stem the increase in mass gun violence. The initiative focuses on law enforcement, firearm availability, school safety, and mental health, including measures like universal background checks, reinstating the assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazines, and enhancing school safety. The $500 million package requires congressional approval, with 23 executive actions to be implemented immediately, such as improving background check data sharing and training for active shooter situations. Obama emphasized the moral obligation to act, stating, "If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The proposal goes beyond initial expectations, but challenges remain, including opposition from the NRA and the need to build public support. The administration acknowledges the proposals won't solve all issues but aim to improve prevention and enforcement. END OF SUMMARY.
