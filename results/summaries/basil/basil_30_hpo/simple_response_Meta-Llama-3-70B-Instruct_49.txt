SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama unveiled a comprehensive gun control proposal, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. The proposal aims to stem the increase in mass gun violence, with Obama emphasizing that "keeping our children safe" is society's first task. The plan includes four key subsections: law enforcement, availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health. Recommendations include requiring criminal background checks, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools. The administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions, including requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system. The approach is sweeping, with Obama vowing to use the full weight of his office to make the recommendations a reality. The proposal has been met with praise from gun control advocates, but the gun-rights lobby has signaled opposition. The administration acknowledges that the proposals are not a cure-all for mass shootings, but insists that they have teeth and can make a tangible impact.
