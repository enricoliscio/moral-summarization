SUMMARY: President Barack Obama unveiled a bold and potentially historic sweeping gun control policy reform, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. The proposal aims to stem the tide of mass gun violence and keep children safe from harm. It addresses four key areas: law enforcement, dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health. Obama's plan includes requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazine capacity, enhancing mental health services in schools, and providing funds for hiring more police officers. The cost of the package is estimated at $500 million. 

Obama's administration also announced immediate executive actions, such as improving training for active shooting situations and researching gun violence causes. The president emphasized his commitment to using the full weight of his office to ensure these recommendations become a reality and save lives. The proposal goes beyond initial expectations and faces opposition from gun-rights lobbyists like the NRA. 

However, the White House acknowledges that the package is not a cure-all, and only a ban on high-capacity magazines could have potentially impacted the Newtown shooting. The administration refrains from targeting lawfully owned weapons and ammunition but aims to prevent future production and sale of military-style weapons. The proposal underscores the moral duty to protect innocent victims from the slaughter of defenseless children. It calls for common-sense, decent, and outraged citizens to demand action from their representatives. 

END OF SUMMARY.
