SUMMARY: President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping set of proposals to reduce gun violence in America, marking the biggest push for gun control in a generation. The plan includes four key areas: law enforcement, dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health. Key provisions include universal background checks for gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, improving mental health services in schools, and increasing funding for police officers and school resource officers. The cost of the package is estimated at $500 million. In addition to these congressional proposals, 23 executive actions will be taken immediately, such as improving training for active shooter situations and directing the CDC to research gun violence. The White House acknowledges that the proposals will not prevent all mass shootings but aims to provide law enforcement with better tools, reduce military-style weapons, and give schools and communities more resources to address violence. Obama called on the American people to demand action from Congress and work together to find solutions. The NRA has criticized the proposals and vowed to block the administration's efforts.
