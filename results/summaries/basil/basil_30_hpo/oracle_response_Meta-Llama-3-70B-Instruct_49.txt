SUMMARY: 

In a historic attempt to stem the increase in mass gun violence, President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping effort at gun control policy reform, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. "This is our first task as a society: keeping our children safe. This is how we will be judged," Obama said. The proposal aims to provide mental health services in schools, allocate funds to hire more police officers, and institute a federal gun trafficking statute, among other policies. The administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions that will be taken immediately, including requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system and providing law enforcement officials with better training for active shooting situations. "If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try," said the president. The approach is so sweeping that what would have otherwise been a headline-grabbing announcement received second billing. The president is putting the full weight of his office behind this, and is ready to push this thing through, but acknowledges that selling them on the Hill will take legislative craft.
