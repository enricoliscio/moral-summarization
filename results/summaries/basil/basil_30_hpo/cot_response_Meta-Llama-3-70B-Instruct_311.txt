SUMMARY:
President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping effort to stem the increase in mass gun violence, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. "This is our first task as a society: keeping our children safe. This is how we will be judged," Obama said. The proposal includes requiring criminal background checks, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools. The administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions, including requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system. Obama emphasized the moral obligation to act, saying "If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The approach is monumental, but the administration acknowledges that selling the proposal on the Hill will require legislative craft. The president urged the American people to demand change, saying "This will not happen unless the American people demand it." END OF SUMMARY.
