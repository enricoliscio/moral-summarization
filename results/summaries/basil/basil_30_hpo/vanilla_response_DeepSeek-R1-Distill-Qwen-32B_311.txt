Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Obama's gun control proposals. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Obama unveiled the most comprehensive gun control measures in a generation. He emphasized the importance of keeping children safe and that this issue can't be delayed. The proposals are divided into four key areas: law enforcement, firearm availability, school safety, and mental health.

Looking at the specifics, the proposals include universal background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, limiting magazines to 10 rounds, banning armor-piercing bullets, providing mental health services in schools, funding more police, and creating a federal gun trafficking law. The cost is estimated at $500 million, some from existing budgets. Additionally, there are 23 executive actions to be taken immediately, like sharing data for background checks and training for law enforcement.

Obama is determined to push these through, recognizing that it's not a cure-all but a significant step. The administration also faces opposition from the NRA, which criticizes the proposals as overreach. The plan is comprehensive but may need to be broken down for legislative feasibility. Public support is crucial, especially in areas where gun ownership is strong.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, capturing the main points: the scope of the proposals, key measures, funding, executive actions, the administration's determination, opposition, and the challenges ahead.

I'll structure it by first stating the unveiling of the proposals, their scope, key components, funding, immediate actions, Obama's commitment, the NRA's opposition, and the acknowledgment that it's a step towards reducing gun violence, needing public support.

Let me make sure I include all the essential elements without getting too detailed. Also, I need to keep the language clear and concise, avoiding jargon.
