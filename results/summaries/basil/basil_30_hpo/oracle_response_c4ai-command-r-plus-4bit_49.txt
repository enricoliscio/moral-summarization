SUMMARY: In a historic attempt to stem the increase in mass gun violence and keep children safe, President Barack Obama unveiled sweeping gun control policy reform proposals, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. The proposal, broken down into law enforcement, firearm availability, school safety, and mental health, includes requiring background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazines, and improving mental health services in schools. The cost is estimated at $500 million. To supplement these recommendations, 23 executive actions will be taken immediately, such as improving training for active shooting situations and directing research on gun violence prevention. The proposal goes beyond what gun control advocates hoped for, and the administration will work with lawmakers and build public opinion to push it through. The gun-rights lobby has criticized the effort as overreach and blamed law-abiding gun owners for the acts of criminals. The White House insists its package has teeth and will provide law enforcement with tools to prevent weapons from falling into the wrong hands, while also improving school and community resources to address violence. This proposal marks a significant moment in the ongoing debate over gun control in America. END OF SUMMARY.
