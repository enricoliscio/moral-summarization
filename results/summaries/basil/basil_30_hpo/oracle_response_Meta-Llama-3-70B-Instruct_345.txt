SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping gun control proposal, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation to stem the increase in mass gun violence. The proposal aims to keep children safe, and Obama emphasized that "this is our first task as a society." The plan includes requiring criminal background checks, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools. The administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions, including directing the Centers for Disease Control to research the causes and prevention of gun violence. Obama intends to use the full weight of his office to make the recommendations a reality, stating "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The proposal goes beyond what most gun control advocates were hoping for, and the administration is working to build public opinion and demand for change. However, the gun-rights lobby has already signaled its opposition, criticizing the administration for overreach. END OF SUMMARY.
