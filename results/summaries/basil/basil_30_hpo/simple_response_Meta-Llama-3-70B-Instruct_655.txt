SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping gun control proposal, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. The proposal aims to stem the increase in mass gun violence, with Obama emphasizing that "keeping our children safe" is the society's first task. The plan includes four key subsections: law enforcement, availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health. It recommends criminal background checks, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools, among other policies. The administration will supplement the proposal with 23 executive actions, including requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system. While the gun-rights lobby has already signaled opposition, Obama vowed to use the full weight of his office to make the proposals a reality, emphasizing that "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try."
