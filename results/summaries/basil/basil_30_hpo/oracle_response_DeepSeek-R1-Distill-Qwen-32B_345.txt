Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Obama's gun control proposals. They also listed morally framed words that should be included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Obama introduced comprehensive gun control measures after a month of review. The proposals include background checks, assault weapons ban, school safety, mental health services, and funding for police. He's using executive actions to implement some policies immediately. The cost is $500 million, and the administration is working with Congress. There's opposition from the NRA, and the proposals are seen as a significant step but not a complete solution.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words from the article. The list includes words like stem, increase, violence, keeping, put, providing, etc. I'll make sure to incorporate these into the summary without making it too long, keeping it under 200 words.

I'll structure the summary by highlighting the key aspects: the bold effort to stem violence, the components of the proposal, the funding, executive actions, the need for public support, opposition, and the limitations. I'll use the moral words to emphasize the urgency and importance of the measures.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." while keeping it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Obama has unveiled a comprehensive gun control proposal, marking the most significant legislative effort in decades to stem the increase in mass gun violence. The plan includes requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, reinstating an assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazine capacity, and providing mental health services in schools. The administration is supplementing its recommendations with 23 executive actions, such as improving background check data sharing and training law enforcement for active shooter situations. The $500 million proposal requires congressional approval, and Obama emphasized the need for public demand to drive its success. Gun control advocates are thrilled, while the NRA has criticized the administration for overreach. The plan, while not a cure-all, aims to prevent future violence by addressing law enforcement, firearm availability, school safety, and mental health. The administration acknowledges the challenges ahead but remains committed to using its influence to push for change. END OF SUMMARY.
