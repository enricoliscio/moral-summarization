Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Obama's gun control proposals. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. 

Obama is introducing a comprehensive set of gun control measures, which is a big deal. He mentions keeping children safe and not putting it off any longer. The proposals include background checks, assault weapons ban, magazine limits, mental health services, and funding for police. The cost is $500 million, some from existing budgets. He's also taking executive actions immediately, like sharing data and training for active shooter situations. 

The administration is pushing hard, but it's up to Congress. Gun control advocates are thrilled, but the NRA is against it, calling it overreach. The proposals aren't a complete solution but aim to reduce gun violence. 

Now, I need to highlight the morally framed words. Words like stem, increase, violence, keeping, put, providing, allocating, trafficking, supplementing, actions, training, directing, research, prevention, intend, saved, try, proposal, push, demand, voices, overreach, failed, blamed, spend, hire, allocate, help, address, improve, riddled, give, address. 

I'll structure the summary to include these words, ensuring it's concise and under 200 words. I'll mention Obama's commitment, the key policies, the cost, executive actions, the administration's efforts, challenges with Congress, NRA's opposition, and the impact on reducing violence. 

Let me put it all together, making sure to include as many of those moral terms as possible without making it too long. I'll start with Obama's bold move, then list the policies, mention the cost and funding, executive actions, the administration's strategy, the need for public demand, NRA's criticism, and conclude with the hope to reduce violence despite not being a cure-all.

SUMMARY: President Obama unveiled comprehensive gun control proposals, marking a significant effort to stem the increase in mass gun violence. The plan includes requiring background checks for all gun sales, reinstating an assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazines, and providing mental health services in schools. The $500 million package also allocates funds for police and school safety, with 23 executive actions to be taken immediately, such as training law enforcement and directing research on gun violence prevention. Obama emphasized the moral obligation to act, stating, "If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The proposal goes beyond initial expectations, but its success hinges on congressional approval and public demand. Gun control advocates are hopeful, while the NRA has criticized the administration for overreach. The plan aims to improve on past policies, such as the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, but does not target existing weapons. The administration hopes the proposal will help address gun violence and save lives. END OF SUMMARY.
