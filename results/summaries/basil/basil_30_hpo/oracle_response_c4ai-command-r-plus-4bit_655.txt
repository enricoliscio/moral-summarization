SUMMARY: In a sweeping attempt to stem mass gun violence and keep children safe, President Barack Obama unveiled bold gun control policy reform proposals, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. The proposals are broken down into four key areas: law enforcement, availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health. The president recommended requiring background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazines, and eliminating armor-piercing bullets. He also proposed providing mental health services in schools, allocating funds for more police officers, and creating a federal gun trafficking statute. The administration is supplementing these recommendations with 23 immediate executive actions, including improved training for active shooting situations and directing the CDC to research gun violence prevention. The proposal goes beyond what gun control advocates hoped for, and the NRA has already signaled its opposition. The White House admits that the proposals are not a cure-all, but they insist they will provide law enforcement with needed mechanisms to prevent illegal weapon transfers and give schools resources to address violence. The question remains as to whether these proposals will be successful in stopping mass shootings and saving lives.
