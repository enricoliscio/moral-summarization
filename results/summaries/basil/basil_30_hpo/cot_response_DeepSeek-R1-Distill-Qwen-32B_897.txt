Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've provided specific steps: first, identify all single words that are morally framed, and then write a concise summary using those words.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral connotation, such as'safe,' 'judge,' 'obligation,' etc. They reflect the author's stance or the moral implications of the actions described.

Looking at the article, I'll go through each paragraph and pick out words that have a moral tone. For example, words like 'bold,' 'historic,''safe,' 'judge,' 'obligation,''sweeping,' 'thrift,' 'hope,' 'push,' 'demand,' 'oppose,' 'hypocrite,' 'fail,' 'attack,' 'cure-all,' 'tooth,' 'comprehensive,' 'learn,' 'hope,' 'process,' 'debate,' 'come up with.'

Next, I need to write a summary that includes these words. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the essence of Obama's gun control proposals, the moral framing, and the reactions from different groups.

I should structure the summary to highlight the main points: the introduction of the proposals, the key elements, the administration's commitment, the challenges in Congress, the opposition from the NRA, and the acknowledgment that the measures aren't a complete solution.

I need to ensure that the morally framed words are included naturally within the summary without forcing them. The summary should flow well and maintain the original tone and moral perspective of the article.

I'll start by outlining the main points: the proposals' goals, the specific measures, the funding, the executive actions, the administration's hope for public support, the NRA's opposition, and the limitations of the proposals.

Now, I'll weave in the morally framed words into the summary, making sure each word fits contextually. For example, using 'bold' to describe the proposals, 'judge' to show the societal expectation, 'obligation' to emphasize the moral duty, 'push' to indicate the effort behind the initiative, and 'oppose' to show the NRA's stance.

I'll also need to keep the summary concise, ensuring it's under 200 words. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the moral framing as per the user's instructions. I'll make sure all the key points are covered and that the morally framed words are appropriately integrated without disrupting the flow.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Obama unveiled sweeping gun control proposals, marking a bold attempt to address rising gun violence. The plan includes background checks, an assault weapons ban, and school safety measures, aiming to "keep our children safe." The administration emphasized the moral obligation to act, urging Congress to approve the measures. While gun control advocates praised the initiative, the NRA opposes it, calling it overreach. The proposals, though not a cure-all, aim to reduce gun violence through stricter laws and community support. Obama stressed the need for public demand and bipartisan effort to succeed. The plan faces challenges in Congress, but the administration remains hopeful, calling it a "monumental moment" in the fight against gun violence. END OF SUMMARY.
