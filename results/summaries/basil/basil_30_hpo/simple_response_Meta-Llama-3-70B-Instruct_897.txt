SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping gun control proposal, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. The proposal aims to stem the increase in mass gun violence, with Obama emphasizing that "keeping our children safe" is society's first task. The plan includes requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools. The administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions, including requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system. The approach is considered monumental, with the president vowing to use the full weight of his office to make the recommendations a reality. However, the gun-rights lobby has already signaled opposition, and the proposal's fate depends on congressional approval and public demand. The president urged the American people to demand change, saying "we can't put this off any longer."
