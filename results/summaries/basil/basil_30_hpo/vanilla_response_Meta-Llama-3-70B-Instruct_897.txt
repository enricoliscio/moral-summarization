SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama has unveiled a comprehensive proposal for gun control reform, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. The proposal aims to stem the increase in mass gun violence and includes four key subsections: law enforcement, availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health. The plan includes requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools. The administration is also taking 23 executive actions immediately, including requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system. The proposal's cost is estimated to be around $500 million. While the gun-rights lobby has signaled opposition, the administration is working to build public opinion and push the proposal through Congress. The president emphasized that the American people must demand change for it to happen.
