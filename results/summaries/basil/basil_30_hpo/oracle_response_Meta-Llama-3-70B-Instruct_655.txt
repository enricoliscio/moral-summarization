SUMMARY: 

President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping effort to stem the increase in mass gun violence, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. "This is our first task as a society: keeping our children safe. This is how we will be judged," Obama said. The proposal, which comes after a month-long review process, aims to provide mental health services in schools, allocate funds to hire more police officers, and institute a federal gun trafficking statute, among other policies. The administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions that will be taken immediately, including requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system and providing law enforcement officials with better training for active shooting situations. "If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try," said the president. The approach is so sweeping that what would have otherwise been a headline-grabbing announcement received second billing. The president's proposal goes beyond what most gun control advocates were hoping for, and is a monumental moment in the effort to stop gun violence.
