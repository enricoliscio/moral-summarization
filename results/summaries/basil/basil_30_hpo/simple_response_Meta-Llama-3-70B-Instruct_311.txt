SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama unveiled a comprehensive gun control proposal, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. The proposal aims to stem the increase in mass gun violence, with Obama emphasizing that "keeping our children safe" is the first task of society. The plan includes four key subsections: law enforcement, availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health. Recommendations include requiring criminal background checks, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools. The administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions, including requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system. Obama vowed to use the full weight of his office to make the recommendations a reality, stating that "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The proposal has been met with enthusiasm from gun control advocates, but the gun-rights lobby has signaled its opposition.
