SUMMARY:
In a historic and bold attempt to stem the increase in mass gun violence, President Barack Obama unveiled the most sweeping effort at gun control policy reform in a generation. "This is our first task as a society: keeping our children safe. This is how we will be judged," Obama said. The proposal, which comes at the end of a month-long review process, includes requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools. The administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions that will be taken immediately. "I intend to use whatever weight this office holds to make them a reality," said the president. The approach is monumental, and the administration is ready to push it through. However, the gun-rights lobby has already signaled that it will try to block the administration's effort, calling it an "unfortunate" and "failed" solution. END OF SUMMARY.
