SUMMARY: In a courageous and potentially historic attempt to reduce mass gun violence, President Barack Obama unveiled the most far-reaching gun control policy reform in a generation. The proposal, which addresses law enforcement, dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health, includes requiring universal background checks for gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and improving mental health services in schools. The cost of the package is estimated at $500 million, and the administration is also taking 23 immediate executive actions, such as improving training for active shooting situations. Obama acknowledged the challenge of getting the proposal through Congress and called on the American people to demand change and build a groundswell of support. He also proposed incentives for police departments to hire more school resource officers and encouraged schools to hire more mental health professionals. The White House admits that the proposals are not a cure-all for mass shootings, but they insist that they will provide law enforcement with needed tools and help prevent military-style weapons from falling into the wrong hands. The question remains as to why the administration took so long to act on gun control.
END OF SUMMARY.
