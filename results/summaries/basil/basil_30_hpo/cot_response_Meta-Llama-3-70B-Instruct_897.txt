SUMMARY:
In a historic and bold attempt to stem the increase in mass gun violence, President Barack Obama unveiled the most sweeping effort at gun control policy reform in a generation. "This is our first task as a society: keeping our children safe. This is how we will be judged," Obama said. The proposal includes requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools. The administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions that will be taken immediately. The approach is so sweeping that it has been called a "monumental moment" by gun control advocates. However, the gun-rights lobby has already signaled that it will try to block the administration's effort, calling it an "unfortunate" and "failed" solution. The president urged the American people to demand change, saying "We are going to need voices in those areas and congressional districts where the tradition of gun ownership is strong."
