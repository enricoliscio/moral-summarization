SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama has unveiled a comprehensive gun control proposal, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. The proposal aims to stem the increase in mass gun violence and includes four key subsections: law enforcement, availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health. The president recommended requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools, among other policies. The cost of the package is estimated to be around $500 million. The administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions that will be taken immediately. The approach is sweeping, and the president has vowed to use the full weight of his office to make the recommendations a reality. However, selling the proposal on the Hill will require legislative craft, and the gun-rights lobby has already signaled its opposition.
