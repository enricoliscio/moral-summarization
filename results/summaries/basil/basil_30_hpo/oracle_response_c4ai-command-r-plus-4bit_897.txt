SUMMARY: In a bold move to stem mass gun violence and keep children safe, President Barack Obama unveiled sweeping gun control policy reform proposals. The proposals, which come after a month-long review process, are divided into four key areas: law enforcement, availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health. The president recommended requiring background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazines, providing mental health services in schools, allocating funds for police officers, and more. The package is estimated to cost $500 million. To supplement the proposals, 23 executive actions will be taken immediately, including improving training for active shooting situations and directing research on gun violence prevention. The administration recognizes that these proposals are not a cure-all, but they aim to provide mechanisms for law enforcement, prevent weapons from falling into the wrong hands, improve upon the previous assault weapons ban, and give schools and communities resources to address violence. The question remains as to why it took so long for the administration to act on gun control, but they assert that they worked tirelessly and comprehensively to develop these proposals.
