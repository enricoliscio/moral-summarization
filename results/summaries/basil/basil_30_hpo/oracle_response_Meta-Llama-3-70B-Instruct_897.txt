SUMMARY: President Barack Obama has unveiled a comprehensive gun control proposal, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation, to stem the increase in mass gun violence and keep children safe. The proposal, broken down into four key subsections, aims to provide mental health services in schools, allocate funds to hire more police officers, and institute a federal gun trafficking statute, among other policies. The administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions, including requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system and providing law enforcement officials with better training for active shooting situations. Obama emphasized that "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The proposal goes beyond what most gun control advocates were hoping for, but its success depends on congressional approval and public demand. The gun-rights lobby has already signaled its opposition, criticizing the administration for overreach. END OF SUMMARY.
