Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's gun control proposals. The user wants a summary that's no more than 200 words, preserving the moral framing from the article. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Obama is introducing comprehensive gun control measures after a month of review. The proposals include background checks, assault weapons ban, magazine limits, mental health services, and school safety. He's also taking executive actions alongside legislative recommendations. The cost is around $500 million, some from existing budgets. Gun control advocates are positive, but there's opposition from the NRA, who see it as overreach. The proposals aren't a complete solution but aim to reduce gun violence.

I need to highlight the moral aspect, so I'll focus on Obama's emphasis on children's safety and the obligation to save lives. I should mention the NRA's criticism and the need for public support. I'll make sure to include the key components of the proposals and the challenges ahead, like legislative efforts and public demand.

I'll structure the summary to start with the announcement, outline the proposals, mention the costs and executive actions, then touch on the reactions from both supporters and opponents. Finally, I'll note that while it's a significant step, it's not a complete solution and requires public backing.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. I'll avoid jargon and keep the language clear. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key points are covered without exceeding the word limit.

The $500 million plan also includes 23 executive actions, such as improving background check data and training for active shooter situations. Obama emphasized the moral obligation to protect children and save lives, stating, "If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." Gun control advocates praised the proposal, while the NRA criticized it as overreach. The administration acknowledges the plan isn't a complete solution but hopes it will reduce gun violence. Passage will require public demand and bipartisan support, as the NRA and others oppose the measures. END OF SUMMARY.
