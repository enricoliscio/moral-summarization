Okay, so I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and identify the moral elements.

The article is about Obama's gun control proposals, which are the most comprehensive in a generation. He emphasizes the need to protect children and reduce gun violence. The proposals include background checks, banning assault weapons, limiting magazine capacity, mental health services, school safety, and funding for police. The administration is also taking executive actions to support these measures.

The moral framing here revolves around responsibility, safety, and the obligation to prevent harm. Words like "stem," "violence," "keeping safe," "provide," "allocate," "trafficking," "recommendations," "actions," "train," "research," "prevent," "intent," "saved," "push," "demand," "voices," "overreach," "failed," "blamed," "allocate," "help," "address," "improve," etc., are key.

I should structure the summary to highlight Obama's commitment, the components of the proposal, the challenges in passing it through Congress, and the moral obligation to act. I need to ensure that the summary is concise, within 200 words, and includes as many of the specified moral words as possible.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure to incorporate the moral language and the key points without getting bogged down in too many details. I'll focus on the main initiatives, the costs, the executive actions, the support from advocates, the opposition from the NRA, and the administration's hope for public support.

I should also mention that the proposals aren't a complete solution but aim to reduce violence. The use of terms like "push," "demand," "voices," and "improve" will help maintain the moral tone. I'll ensure the summary flows logically, covering the proposal's scope, its components, the legislative challenges, and the moral imperative behind it.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it's under 200 words and that all key moral elements are included without making it sound too verbose or jargon-heavy. The goal is to capture the essence of the article while emphasizing the ethical and societal responsibilities involved.

SUMMARY: President Obama unveiled comprehensive gun control proposals, marking the most significant legislative effort in decades to stem the increase in mass gun violence. He emphasized the moral obligation to protect children and prevent harm, stating, "We canâ€™t put this off any longer." The proposals include requiring universal background checks, reinstating an assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazine capacity, and providing mental health services in schools. The administration is supplementing its recommendations with 23 executive actions, such as enhancing training for law enforcement and directing the CDC to research gun violence prevention. The $500 million plan requires congressional approval, and the administration is urging public support to push the measures through. Gun control advocates praised the initiative, while the NRA criticized it as overreach. The proposals aim to improve school safety, reduce illegal trafficking, and allocate resources for law enforcement, though they do not address existing weapons. The administration stresses the moral imperative to act, acknowledging that while the measures are not a cure-all, they represent a critical step toward reducing violence and saving lives. END OF SUMMARY.
