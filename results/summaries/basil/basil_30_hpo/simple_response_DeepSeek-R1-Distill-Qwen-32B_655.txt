Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's gun control proposals. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. 

The article talks about Obama unveiling comprehensive gun control measures after a month of review. He emphasizes keeping children safe and the urgency of the issue. The proposals include background checks, assault weapons ban, magazine limits, mental health services, and funding for police. The cost is around $500 million, some from existing budgets. He's also taking executive actions immediately, like improving background check data and training for law enforcement. 

Obama stresses that public support is crucial, especially in areas where gun ownership is common. The gun lobby opposes the measures, with the NRA criticizing the administration. The proposals aren't a complete solution but aim to prevent future violence. The administration is hopeful but acknowledges challenges in getting Congress to approve the measures.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral elements like the emphasis on child safety, the need for public demand, and the opposition from the NRA. I'll structure it to highlight Obama's stance, the key proposals, the challenges, and the administration's hopes.

I should start with Obama's unveiling, mention the key points of the proposals, the funding, executive actions, the moral obligation, the opposition, and the administration's outlook. I need to ensure the moral framing is clear, like the obligation to save lives and the need for public support.

Let me draft that, making sure it's concise and within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it captures the essence without unnecessary details. Also, I'll make sure to end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama unveiled comprehensive gun control proposals, marking the most significant legislative effort in decades to address rising gun violence. The plan includes universal background checks, reinstating an assault weapons ban, limiting magazine capacity, and enhancing school safety and mental health services. The $500 million proposal requires congressional approval, but Obama is also taking 23 executive actions, such as improving background check data and training for law enforcement. He emphasized the moral obligation to act, stating, "If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The administration acknowledges the challenges of gaining bipartisan support, particularly in regions with strong gun ownership traditions. Gun rights groups, like the NRA, have criticized the proposals as overreach. While the measures don't fully address all gun violence issues, the administration hopes they will reduce future incidents and save lives. END OF SUMMARY.
