Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Obama's gun control proposals. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

The article starts by saying Obama unveiled the most sweeping gun control effort in a generation. He mentions it's about keeping children safe and can't be delayed. The proposals are divided into four areas: law enforcement, firearm availability, school safety, and mental health. 

Specifically, the proposals include universal background checks, reinstating the assault weapons ban, limiting ammo magazines to 10 rounds, banning armor-piercing bullets, mental health services in schools, more police funding, and a federal gun trafficking statute. The cost is around $500 million, some from existing budgets. 

Obama also took executive actions, like data sharing for background checks, training for law enforcement, and CDC research on gun violence. He emphasized the importance of public support and admitted the proposals aren't a complete solution but aim to reduce mass shootings. The NRA opposes the measures, calling them overreach. The plan includes funding for cops and school resource officers, and emergency plans for schools and places of worship. 

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary. I'll focus on the main initiatives, the cost, the need for congressional approval, the executive actions, and the opposition. Also, mention that it's a significant step but not a cure-all. 

Let me structure it: introduce the initiative, list key proposals, mention cost and funding, note the need for Congress, executive actions, public support, opposition from NRA, and the overall aim.

I should make sure it's concise and covers all main points without going into too much detail. Avoiding jargon and keeping it clear.

SUMMARY: President Obama has unveiled the most comprehensive gun control initiative in decades, aiming to reduce mass gun violence. The proposals include universal background checks, reinstating the assault weapons ban, limiting ammo magazines to 10 rounds, banning armor-piercing bullets, expanding mental health services in schools, funding police, and creating a federal gun trafficking statute. The $500 million plan, partly funded by existing budgets, requires congressional approval. Obama also took immediate executive actions, such as improving background check data sharing, training law enforcement, and researching gun violence. He emphasized the need for public support, as the NRA opposes the measures, calling them overreach. The initiative, while significant, isn't a complete solution but aims to reduce mass shootings by limiting future military-style weapons and ammo sales. END OF SUMMARY.
