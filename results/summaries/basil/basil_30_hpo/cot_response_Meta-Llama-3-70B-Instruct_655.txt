SUMMARY:
President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping gun control proposal, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. The plan aims to stem the increase in mass gun violence, with Obama emphasizing that "keeping our children safe" is society's first task. The proposal includes requiring criminal background checks, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools. The administration estimates the cost to be around $500 million. Obama stressed that "if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try." The plan is a "monumental moment" for gun control advocates, but its success depends on public demand and congressional approval. The gun-rights lobby has already signaled opposition, calling the administration's effort an "unfortunate" and "failed" solution. END OF SUMMARY.
