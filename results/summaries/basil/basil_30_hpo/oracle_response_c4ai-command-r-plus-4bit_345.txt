SUMMARY: In an attempt to stem the increase in mass gun violence and keep children safe, President Barack Obama unveiled sweeping gun control policy reform proposals, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. The proposal, broken down into law enforcement, availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health, includes requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools. The administration is also taking 23 executive actions immediately, such as improving training for active shooting situations and researching gun violence prevention. The proposal goes beyond what gun control advocates were hoping for, and the NRA has signaled it will try to block the effort. The White House admits the proposals are not a cure-all but insists they have teeth and will provide law enforcement with needed mechanisms to prevent weapons from falling into the wrong hands. The question remains as to why the administration took so long to act.
END OF SUMMARY.
