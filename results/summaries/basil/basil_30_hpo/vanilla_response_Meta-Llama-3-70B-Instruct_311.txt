SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama has unveiled a sweeping proposal to reform gun control policy in the US, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. The proposal aims to stem the increase in mass gun violence and is broken down into four key subsections: law enforcement, availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health. The president recommended requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools, among other policies. The cost of the package is estimated to be around $500 million. The administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions that will be taken immediately. The approach is so sweeping that it goes beyond what most gun control advocates were hoping for. However, selling the proposal to Congress will require legislative craft, and the president will need to build public opinion to push it through.

END OF SUMMARY.
