SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama has unveiled a comprehensive gun control proposal, marking the biggest legislative effort in a generation. The proposal aims to stem the increase in mass gun violence and includes four key subsections: law enforcement, availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health. The president recommended requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, and providing mental health services in schools, among other policies. The cost of the package is estimated to be around $500 million. The administration is also taking 23 executive actions immediately, including requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system. While the proposal is sweeping, it faces opposition from the gun-rights lobby, and its success will depend on public demand and congressional approval.

END OF SUMMARY.
