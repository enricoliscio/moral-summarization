SUMMARY:
In a bold and potentially historic move, President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping set of proposals to address the increase in mass gun violence. The plan, which comes after a month-long review process led by Vice President Joe Biden, aims to tackle four key areas: law enforcement, dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety, and mental health. The moral heart of the proposal is to fulfill "our first task as a society: keeping our children safe," as Obama stated. 

The plan includes a mix of legislative recommendations and executive actions, with a total estimated cost of $500 million. Legislative proposals include universal background checks for gun sales, reinstating the assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazine capacity, banning armor-piercing bullets, and improving mental health services in schools. Executive actions will enhance training for active shooting situations and direct research into gun violence causes and prevention. 

The comprehensive approach goes beyond what gun control advocates initially hoped for and faces opposition from gun rights lobbyists. The White House admits the proposals are not a cure-all, but they aim to give law enforcement teeth to prevent illegal weapon transfers, stem the use of military-style weapons, and provide resources for schools and communities to address violence. Obama acknowledged that change will only come if the American people demand it and work to push these moral good over evil proposals through Congress. 

END OF SUMMARY.
