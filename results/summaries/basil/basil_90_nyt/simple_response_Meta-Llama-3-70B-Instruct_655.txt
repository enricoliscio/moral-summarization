SUMMARY:

The newly sworn-in 116th Congress has been shaken by a freshman House Democrat's expletive-laden promise to impeach President Trump. Representative Rashida Tlaib's comments have sparked a heated debate, with Republicans accusing Democrats of being out to destroy Trump's presidency. Democratic leaders, however, are trying to downplay the issue, viewing impeachment discussions as premature and politically dangerous. Trump, on the other hand, has dived into the conversation, even suggesting that an impeachment fight could help him politically. The episode has exposed the deep divisions within the Democratic party, with some members calling for impeachment while others advocate for a more cautious approach. The controversy has also highlighted the moral implications of impeachment, with some arguing that it would be unjust to impeach Trump without a thorough investigation.
