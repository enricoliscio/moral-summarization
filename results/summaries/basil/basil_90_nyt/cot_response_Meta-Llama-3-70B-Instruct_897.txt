SUMMARY:
In a divided Washington, a freshman House Democrat's expletive-laden promise to impeach President Trump has sparked controversy. Representative Rashida Tlaib's remarks were criticized by Republicans as "foul-mouthed" and "disrespectful," with some comments racially tinged. Democratic leaders, who view impeachment discussions as "premature" and "dangerous," tried to tamp down speculation about their intentions. However, President Trump dived into the conversation, asking if Democrats planned to impeach him. Trump's frank embrace of the issue was seen as "astonishing." Democrats are determined not to take the bait, fearing a "backlash" from Trump's supporters. Meanwhile, Tlaib stood by her comments, saying she would always "speak truth to power." END OF SUMMARY.
