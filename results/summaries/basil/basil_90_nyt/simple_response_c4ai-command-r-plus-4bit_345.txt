SUMMARY: The inauguration of the 116th United States Congress was marked by controversy when Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, a newly elected Democrat and one of the first Muslim women in Congress, was filmed making an exuberant and profane promise to impeach President Trump. The incident quickly escalated into a partisan battle, with Republicans criticizing Ms. Tlaib's comments as disrespectful and racially tinged, while Democrats tried to distance themselves from the discussion of impeachment. 

President Trump, however, eagerly engaged in the conversation, going as far as to bring up impeachment during a meeting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who denied offering him any reassurances. The incident highlighted the growing pressure on Democratic leaders from the left, where many liberals want the president removed from office. Despite their concerns about the president's conduct, senior Democrats, including Ms. Pelosi and Representative Jerrold Nadler, have cautioned against impeachment, arguing that it is premature and could backfire politically. 

Ms. Tlaib stood by her comments, stating that she would always speak truth to power, while some of her colleagues expressed sympathy for her sentiments. The episode underscored the deep divisions in Washington and the challenges faced by Democrats as they navigate the potential impeachment of a president who has shown no hesitation in embracing the issue head-on.
END OF SUMMARY.
