SUMMARY: In the first 24 hours of the 116th Congress, Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan made headlines with her exuberant and profanity-laced promise to impeach President Trump. This episode quickly escalated impeachment discussions within a divided Washington and prompted a direct response from the president himself. Republicans criticized Ms. Tlaib's comments, with some using racially tinged language, while Democratic leaders tried to downplay impeachment talk as premature. President Trump, however, openly embraced the topic during a White House news conference. Despite the pressure from the left and public opinion polls suggesting liberal support for impeachment, senior Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, maintained that it is too early to consider impeachment. They argued that an impeachment attempt without a reasonable chance of conviction in the Senate would backfire and strengthen Mr. Trump politically. Nonetheless, House Democrats have introduced articles of impeachment, and multiple investigations into accusations of wrongdoing by the president and his administration are expected to take place.
END OF SUMMARY.
