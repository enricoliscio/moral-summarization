SUMMARY: A freshman Democrat's exuberant and profane impeachment promise upended the bonhomie of a divided Washington and prompted President Trump to ask the newly elected speaker, Nancy Pelosi, if Democrats planned to impeach him. The episode began when a camera captured Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan promising to impeach the "motherf****r" and drew cheers from liberal activists. Despite attempts by Democratic leaders to tamp down speculation about their intentions, Mr. Trump frankly embraced the issue of impeachment, even discussing it with Ms. Pelosi during a meeting meant to negotiate an end to the government shutdown. Republicans criticized Ms. Tlaib's comments as disgraceful and disrespectful, while many of her Democratic colleagues expressed sympathy for her sentiments. Ms. Pelosi defended Ms. Tlaib's right to speak her mind but maintained that it was too early to consider impeachment. The episode highlights the mounting pressure on Democrats from the left to take action against Mr. Trump, as well as the peril and political dangers of impeachment for the party. It also showcases the astonishing frankness with which Mr. Trump embraces potentially divisive issues.
