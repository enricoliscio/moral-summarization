SUMMARY: The threat of impeachment has been looming over Washington since the Democratic Party gained control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections. However, the discussion took an unexpected turn when Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan made an exuberant and profane promise to impeach President Trump, causing a stir among both Democrats and Republicans. While Republicans criticized Tlaib's comments, with some even using racially tinged language, Democratic leaders tried to downplay the speculation, believing that an impeachment attempt could backfire and strengthen Trump's position. Despite this, Trump openly addressed the issue, claiming that Pelosi had assured him that Democrats were not planning to impeach him, which Pelosi's aides disputed. The episode highlights the pressure mounting from the left to hold Trump accountable, even as Democratic leaders prefer to wait for the findings of the Mueller investigation before making any decisions. The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach, but what constitutes "high crimes and misdemeanors" is defined by the majority party in the House. As the debate continues, many Democrats believe that Trump poses a threat to the country's democratic institutions and that investigations into his conduct are necessary. 

END OF SUMMARY.
