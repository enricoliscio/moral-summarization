SUMMARY:

The newly elected Congress is already divided, with impeachment hanging over Washington. Freshman House Democrat Rashida Tlaib's expletive-laden promise to impeach President Trump has sparked criticism and threatening behavior from Republicans. Tlaib's words, though criticized by some Democrats, reflect the pressure from the left to remove Trump from office. Democrats, however, are cautious, viewing discussion of impeachment as premature and potentially politically dangerous. They want to wait for the findings of the special counsel's investigation before considering impeachment. Trump, on the other hand, has dived into the conversation, asking if Democrats plan to impeach him and claiming that he cannot be impeached because he is doing a great job. The episode has exposed the deepening legal perils facing Trump and the potential for wrongdoing in his administration. Democrats plan to open multiple investigations into accusations of wrongdoing, but Republicans have seized on Tlaib's words to portray Democrats as out to destroy Trump's presidency. END OF SUMMARY.
