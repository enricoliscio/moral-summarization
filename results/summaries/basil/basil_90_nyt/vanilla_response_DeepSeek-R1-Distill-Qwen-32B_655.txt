Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the recent events surrounding impeachment discussions in the U.S. Congress. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that impeachment has been a significant issue in Washington since the new Congress began. It highlights an incident where Representative Rashida Tlaib made a profane promise to impeach Trump, which led to a lot of reactions. I should note that Tlaib's comments were part of a celebration after the Congress was sworn in.

Next, the article talks about Trump's response. He brought up impeachment during a meeting with Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, while discussing the government shutdown. Pelosi denied planning to impeach him, but there's some dispute over the exact conversation details. It's important to include that Trump openly discussed impeachment, which is unusual.

The article also mentions that some Republicans criticized Tlaib, some with racial overtones, and that Democrats, including Pelosi, are cautious about impeachment, considering it premature and politically risky. They want to wait for the Mueller investigation's findings.

Additionally, other Democrats, like Brad Sherman and Al Green, have introduced articles of impeachment, focusing on obstruction of justice. There's a divide between those eager to move forward and those who want to proceed more cautiously.

I should structure the summary to cover these points concisely: the incident with Tlaib, Trump's response, the reactions from both parties, the cautious stance of Democratic leaders, and the ongoing discussions about impeachment.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main events and reactions without going into too much detail. Also, I'll ensure to mention the key players and their positions on impeachment.

Let me make sure to include the essential elements: Tlaib's statement, Trump's mention of impeachment, Pelosi's response, the cautious approach by Democrats, and the broader context of potential investigations and political implications.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the summary clear and straightforward. I'll start with the incident, then move to the political reactions, and conclude with the current stance and future possibilities regarding impeachment.
