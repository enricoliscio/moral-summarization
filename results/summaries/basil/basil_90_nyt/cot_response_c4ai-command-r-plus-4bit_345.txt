SUMMARY: House Democrat Rashida Tlaib's exuberant and expletive-laden promise to impeach President Trump has upended the bonhomie of the new Congress and prompted a discussion on impeachment. The episode began just hours after the 116th Congress was sworn in and has already caused a divide among lawmakers. Tlaib's comments have been criticized by Republicans, who have singled out Speaker Nancy Pelosi for not censuring the freshman Democrat. Despite the criticism, Tlaib stands by her comments and has refused to apologize. Democratic leaders, including Pelosi, have tried to tamp down speculation about their intentions, arguing that it is too early to consider impeachment. However, many Democrats believe that Trump is threatening the country's democratic institutions and suspect that he has obstructed justice and collaborated with Russia during the 2016 election. Republicans have ignored this distinction and criticized the Democrats' behavior as the new majority party in Congress. The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach officials for treason, bribery, and other high crimes, but what constitutes such crimes is defined by the majority party. While some Democrats are pushing for impeachment, others are concerned that it could backfire and strengthen Trump in the 2020 election. END OF SUMMARY.
