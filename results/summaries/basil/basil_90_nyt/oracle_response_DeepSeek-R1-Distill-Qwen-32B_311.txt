Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. The summary needs to be under 200 words and should end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about the recent events surrounding the new Congress and the topic of impeaching Trump. Rashida Tlaib made some strong statements, which caused a stir. Trump brought up impeachment during a meeting about the government shutdown. Pelosi and other Democrats are cautious about impeachment, fearing political backlash. There's also mention of legal issues and investigations.

Now, I need to identify the key moral terms: criticism, threaten, shutdown, impeachment, reopening, crime, interfere, treason, bribery, crimes, misdemeanors, threatening, obstructed, collaborated, wrongdoing, behavior, obstruction, misdemeanor, impeached, martyr.

I'll start by outlining the main events: Tlaib's statement, Trump's reaction, Pelosi's caution, the legal issues, and the political implications.

I should make sure to include words like criticism, threaten, impeachment, shutdown, crime, obstruction, wrongdoing, and martyr. I need to keep the summary concise, so I'll focus on the most impactful points.

Let me draft a summary that includes these elements, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows naturally.

SUMMARY: The recent events in Washington highlight the moral and political tensions surrounding President Trump's potential impeachment. Rashida Tlaib, a freshman House Democrat, sparked controversy by vowing to impeach Trump during a celebration, using strong language that drew criticism and racial undertones from Republicans. Trump himself addressed the issue during a news conference, suggesting Democrats might use impeachment as a political tool, while Pelosi and other Democrats caution against premature action, fearing backlash. Legal concerns, including possible obstruction of justice and collaboration with Russia, loom large, though Democrats aim to follow Mueller's findings. Tlaib's bold stance reflects growing pressure from the left, with some colleagues supporting her sentiment but advocating for a more measured approach. The debate underscores the delicate balance between pursuing justice and avoiding political martyrdom for Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
