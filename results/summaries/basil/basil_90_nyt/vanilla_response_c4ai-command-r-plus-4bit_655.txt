SUMMARY: Impeachment discussions have dominated the early days of the 116th US Congress, following a profanity-laden comment by Representative Rashida Tlaib, a freshman Democrat from Michigan, about impeaching President Trump. Tlaib's comment, made at a celebration near the Capitol, prompted a direct response from Trump during a news conference in the Rose Garden. While Trump claimed that Speaker Nancy Pelosi assured him Democrats were not planning to impeach him, Pelosi's spokesman disputed this. The episode has highlighted divisions within the Democratic Party, with some members, like Tlaib, eager to impeach Trump, while others, like Pelosi and Representative Jerrold Nadler, argue that it is too early to consider impeachment. Republicans have criticized Tlaib's comments and accused Democrats of being focused on impeachment rather than governing. Despite the divisions, many Democrats believe Trump has threatened the country's democratic institutions and suspect him of obstructing justice and colluding with Russia. They plan to open multiple investigations into accusations of wrongdoing by the president and his administration.
END OF SUMMARY.
