SUMMARY:

The newly sworn-in 116th Congress has been plunged into controversy after a freshman House Democrat, Rashida Tlaib, made an expletive-laden promise to impeach President Trump, sparking criticism from Republicans and concern from Democratic leaders. Tlaib's comments, which were met with cheers from liberal activists, have been labeled as "foul-mouthed" and "racially tinged" by some Republicans. Democratic leaders, who view discussion of impeachment as premature, have tried to tamp down speculation about their intentions, fearing a backlash from Trump's supporters. However, Tlaib's words have highlighted the pressure from the left to remove Trump from office, with many liberals wanting him impeached. Trump, meanwhile, has embraced the issue, claiming that "you can't impeach somebody who is doing a great job." The episode has raised questions about the behavior of Democrats and the potential for impeachment, with some arguing that it could backfire and strengthen Trump in the 2020 campaign.
