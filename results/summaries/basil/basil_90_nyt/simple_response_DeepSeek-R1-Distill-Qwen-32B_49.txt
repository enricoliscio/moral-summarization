Alright, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned they're a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to create a concise summary of the provided news article, keeping the moral aspects intact. The summary should be under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Representative Rashida Tlaib's expletive-laden promise to impeach Trump, which caused a stir. The article discusses the reactions from both parties, the context of impeachment discussions, and the broader implications for Congress and Trump's presidency.

I need to capture the moral framing, which includes the tension between Democrats wanting to impeach and their cautious approach, Trump's reaction, and the potential political fallout. I should highlight Tlaib's strong stance, the divide in Congress, and the strategic considerations from both sides.

I'll structure the summary to include the key events: Tlaib's comment, Trump's response, the reactions from Pelosi and other Democrats, the Republican criticism, and the ongoing investigations. I'll make sure to mention the moral implications, like the risk of backlash and the potential impact on the 2020 election.

I should keep the language clear and concise, ensuring that the moral dimensions are evident. I'll avoid getting bogged down in too many details, focusing instead on the main ethical and political conflicts presented in the article.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and accurately reflects the article's moral framing.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the recent stir caused by Representative Rashida Tlaib's profane promise to impeach President Trump, which sparked immediate reactions from both parties. Tlaib's remarks at a post-election celebration drew cheers from liberals but were met with criticism, particularly from Republicans who framed it as an attack on Trump's presidency. Trump himself addressed the issue at a press conference, suggesting Democrats were considering impeachment, while Democratic leaders, including Nancy Pelosi, downplayed the idea, emphasizing the need to wait for the Mueller investigation's findings. Tlaib defended her comments, asserting she would "speak truth to power," while Pelosi distanced herself from the rhetoric, stating the focus should remain on reopening the government. The article highlights the growing divide in Congress, with some Democrats, like Brad Sherman and Al Green, formally introducing articles of impeachment, while others caution against premature action to avoid political backlash. The moral framing underscores the tension between accountability and political strategy, with Democrats balancing the risk of impeachment with the potential consequences for Trump's presidency and their own political fortunes. END OF SUMMARY.
