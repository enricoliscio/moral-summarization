Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the recent events in Washington involving impeachment. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

First, the article talks about how the 116th Congress started, and a freshman Democrat, Rashida Tlaib, made some strong statements about impeaching Trump. She used expletives, which caused a stir. Then, Trump responded by asking Nancy Pelosi if they planned to impeach him, which led to a bigger discussion.

I should note the key points: Tlaib's exuberant statement, Trump's response, the reactions from both parties, and the broader implications for impeachment proceedings. Also, the article mentions that some Democrats are cautious about impeachment, while others are pushing for it.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all the essential elements without getting bogged down in details. I should structure it to flow logically, starting with Tlaib's statement, moving to Trump's reaction, and then the differing opinions among Democrats and Republicans.

I should also include that Tlaib stood by her comments and that other Democrats have introduced articles of impeachment. It's important to mention Pelosi's stance on waiting for more information and the potential political risks involved.

I need to avoid jargon and keep it clear. Let me piece together the main events and opinions to form a coherent summary.

SUMMARY: A freshman House Democrat, Rashida Tlaib, sparked controversy by promising to impeach President Trump during a celebration after the 116th Congress was sworn in. Her expletive-laden remarks drew criticism, including racially tinged attacks, while Trump addressed the issue at a news conference, asserting he had asked Speaker Nancy Pelosi about impeachment during a meeting. Pelosi and her aides denied Trump's claim, emphasizing the focus on reopening the government. Democrats are cautious about impeachment, fearing political backlash, but some, like Tlaib and Representatives Brad Sherman and Al Green, are pushing for it. Tlaib defended her comments, stating she would "speak truth to power." Pelosi and others argue it's too early to discuss impeachment, preferring to wait for Mueller's findings. Republicans, meanwhile, criticized Tlaib and portrayed Democrats as intent on destroying Trump's presidency. The situation highlights growing divisions and the potential political risks of impeachment. END OF SUMMARY.
