SUMMARY: A freshman Democrat's exuberant promise to impeach President Trump has upended the bonhomie of the new Congress and prompted discussions of impeachment. Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan made the profanity-laced comment at a celebration near the Capitol, which was captured on camera. This sparked criticism from Republicans and concern from Democratic leaders, who view impeachment discussions as premature. President Trump openly discussed impeachment at a White House news conference, claiming that Speaker Nancy Pelosi assured him that Democrats were not looking to impeach him. Democratic leaders disputed this characterization, saying Pelosi tried to shift the conversation back to reopening the government. The episode highlights the pressure mounting from the left to impeach Trump, even as Democratic leaders argue that an impeachment without a reasonable shot at conviction in the Senate will backfire. Republicans have criticized the comments and Pelosi's response, while Democrats have expressed sympathy for Tlaib's sentiments but cautioned against proceeding with impeachment at this time.
END OF SUMMARY.
