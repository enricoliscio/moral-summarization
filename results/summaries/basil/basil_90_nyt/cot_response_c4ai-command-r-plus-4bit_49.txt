SUMMARY:
The prospect of impeachment has cast a shadow over a divided Washington, with freshman Democrat Rashida Tlaib's exuberant and profane promise to impeach President Trump igniting intense debate. Republicans criticized Tlaib's remarks as disgraceful and disrespectful, with some using racially tinged language. Democratic leaders, worried about appearing premature, tried to tamp down speculation of impeachment plans. Trump, facing potential peril, openly embraced the issue, claiming he cannot be impeached because he is "doing a great job." Despite pressure from the left, Democrats are cautious, fearing a backlash from Trump supporters who could see impeachment as an overreaction. Tlaib's colleagues express sympathy for her sentiments but want to proceed differently to avoid making Trump a martyr. The Constitution grants the House power to impeach for treason, bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors, but what constitutes such crimes is defined by the majority party. The impeachment process requires a simple majority in the House but a two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict and remove an official from office. Democrats plan multiple investigations into accusations of wrongdoing by Trump and his administration. END OF SUMMARY.
