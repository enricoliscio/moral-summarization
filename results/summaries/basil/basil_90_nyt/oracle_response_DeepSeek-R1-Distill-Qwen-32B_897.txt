Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use as many of the morally charged words as possible from the list they provided. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the recent events involving Representative Rashida Tlaib's comments on impeaching Trump, the reactions from both parties, and the broader implications for the new Congress. The moral framing here includes words like criticism, threaten, impeachment, crime, etc.

I should start by identifying the key events: Tlaib's expletive-laden promise, Trump's response, the Republican and Democratic reactions, and the ongoing discussions about impeachment. I need to make sure to include the morally framed words without making the summary too long—under 200 words.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflict, the opposing viewpoints, and the potential consequences. I'll mention Tlaib's comments, Trump's involvement, the party reactions, and the strategic considerations around impeachment. 

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and covers all critical points while incorporating the moral terms. I'll avoid adding my own opinions and stick strictly to summarizing the article's content with the specified framing.

SUMMARY:  
The recent events surrounding Representative Rashida Tlaib’s expletive-laden promise to impeach President Trump have sparked intense political and moral debate. Tlaib’s comments at a post-election celebration, where she vowed to “impeach the motherfucker,” drew criticism from Republicans, who accused her of being disrespectful and racially tinged in their attacks. Trump himself brought up impeachment during a meeting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, asking if Democrats planned to “use this for impeachment.” Pelosi denied any such intentions, emphasizing that the discussion should focus on reopening the government, which Trump had shut down over border wall funding.  

Democrats, including Pelosi and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, have cautioned against premature impeachment discussions, arguing it could backfire politically. Meanwhile, Tlaib and other progressives, like Representatives Brad Sherman and Al Green, have formally introduced articles of impeachment, accusing Trump of obstructing justice. Trump’s supporters view impeachment as an overreach, while liberals, supported by public opinion polls, increasingly demand his removal.  

The moral framing of the debate centers on accusations of wrongdoing, obstruction, and potential threats to democratic institutions. Republicans, led by Kevin McCarthy, have criticized Tlaib’s behavior, while Democrats argue for a measured approach to avoid creating a “martyr” for Trump. The situation remains tense, with both sides weighing political risks and moral imperatives.  
END OF SUMMARY.
