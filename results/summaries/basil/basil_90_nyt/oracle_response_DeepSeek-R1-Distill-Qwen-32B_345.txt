Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure those words are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Representative Rashida Tlaib's statement about impeaching Trump, the reactions from both parties, and the broader implications for impeachment discussions.

I need to identify key events: Tlaib's expletive-laden promise, Trump's response, Pelosi's stance, and the political dynamics. I should include the morally charged words like "criticism," "threaten," "shutdown," "impeachment," etc.

I'll structure the summary to cover Tlaib's statement, Trump's reaction, Pelosi's caution, the legal context, and the ongoing debate. I'll make sure to use as many of the listed words as possible without making it sound forced.

I should also keep the tone neutral but include the moral elements. Maybe start with Tlaib's action, then move to Trump's response, followed by Pelosi's caution, and end with the ongoing investigations and political considerations.

Let me draft this, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows naturally while incorporating the necessary moral terms.

SUMMARY: The article details the political fallout after Representative Rashida Tlaib made a profane promise to impeach President Trump during a celebration shortly after the 116th Congress was sworn in. Her statement sparked criticism from Republicans, who accused her of being disrespectful and racially tinged, while Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, distanced themselves from her remarks, emphasizing that impeachment discussions were premature. Trump himself addressed the issue, claiming Pelosi denied any plans for impeachment during a meeting to resolve the government shutdown. Pelosi's aides disputed Trump's account, stating the meeting focused on reopening the government, not impeachment. Tlaib stood by her comments, asserting her right to speak truth to power. While some Democrats, like Representatives Brad Sherman and Al Green, have introduced articles of impeachment, others, including Pelosi and Jerrold Nadler, caution against rushing into the process, fearing political backlash. The article highlights the tension between the left's push for impeachment and Democratic leaders' desire to proceed cautiously, emphasizing the legal and political stakes involved in the impeachment process. END OF SUMMARY.
