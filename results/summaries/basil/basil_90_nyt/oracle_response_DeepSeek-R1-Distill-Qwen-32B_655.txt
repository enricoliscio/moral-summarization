Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible. The summary needs to be concise, no longer than 200 words, and should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the new Congress and the immediate focus on impeachment of Trump. Rashida Tlaib made some strong statements, which led to criticism and political maneuvering. The Democrats are divided on whether to pursue impeachment, with some leaders cautioning against it too early. Trump is reacting to these developments.

I need to identify the key morally framed words: criticism, threaten, shutdown, impeachment, reopening, crime, treason, bribery, obstruction, collaborate, wrongdoing, etc. I should incorporate these into the summary.

I'll start by mentioning the new Congress and the focus on impeachment. Then, describe Tlaib's expletive-laden promise and the subsequent criticism. Mention Trump bringing up impeachment during the shutdown talks. Note the divide among Democrats, with some supporting impeachment and others cautioning. Include the legal issues Trump faces and the Mueller investigation. Highlight the moral implications like obstruction of justice and collaboration with Russia. Conclude with the ongoing investigations and the political stakes.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the important points without going over the word limit. I'll structure it in a few sentences, each covering a main point, using the morally framed words where appropriate.

SUMMARY: The newly elected 116th Congress quickly became entangled in the issue of impeachment after Representative Rashida Tlaib made a profane promise to impeach President Trump, drawing criticism and sparking a political firestorm. Trump directly addressed the matter, asking Speaker Nancy Pelosi if Democrats planned to impeach him, while Republicans accused Tlaib of being disrespectful and racially tinged. Pelosi and other Democrats distanced themselves from Tlaib's remarks, emphasizing that impeachment discussions were premature and politically risky. Trump, however, embraced the topic, asserting that impeachment would backfire if Democrats pursued it. Tlaib stood by her comments, framing them as a bold statement against Trump's actions. Meanwhile, some Democrats, like Representatives Brad Sherman and Al Green, formally introduced articles of impeachment, focusing on potential obstruction of justice. Pelosi and others cautioned against rushing into impeachment without sufficient evidence, fearing it could strengthen Trump politically. The article highlights the moral and political stakes, including accusations of wrongdoing, obstruction, and potential collaboration with Russia, as Democrats weigh the risks of pursuing impeachment. END OF SUMMARY.
