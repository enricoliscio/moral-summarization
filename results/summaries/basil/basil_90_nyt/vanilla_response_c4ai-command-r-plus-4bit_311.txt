SUMMARY: Just hours after the new Congress was sworn in, Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan was captured on camera promising to impeach President Trump, sparking a heated debate among Democrats and Republicans. The episode upended the bonhomie of the new Congress and prompted President Trump to ask the newly elected speaker, Nancy Pelosi, if Democrats planned to impeach him. While Ms. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders view discussion of impeachment as premature and politically dangerous, Mr. Trump openly embraced the issue at a White House news conference. Ms. Tlaib's comments put pressure on Democrats from the left, as public opinion polls suggest a majority of liberals want the president removed from office. Republicans criticized Ms. Tlaib's comments and accused Democrats of being out to destroy Mr. Trump's presidency. Despite the controversy, Ms. Pelosi defended Ms. Tlaib's right to free speech and said she was "not in the censorship business." Democrats are planning to open multiple investigations into accusations of wrongdoing around the president, his campaign, and his administration.
END OF SUMMARY.
