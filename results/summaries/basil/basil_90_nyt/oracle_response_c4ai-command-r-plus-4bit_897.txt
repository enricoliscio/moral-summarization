SUMMARY: Impeachment is hanging heavily over Washington after a freshman House Democrat, Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, made an exuberant promise to impeach President Trump, prompting him to ask the newly elected Speaker Nancy Pelosi if Democrats planned to impeach him. Republicans criticized Ms. Tlaib, with some comments racially tinged, and Democratic leaders tried to downplay impeachment speculation, believing it could backfire and strengthen Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump, however, embraced the issue, asking how someone who won a great election could be impeached. Ms. Tlaib's comments put pressure on Democrats from the left, where polls suggest a majority want the president removed. She stood by her comments, saying she will always speak truth to power. The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach for treason, bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors, but Democrats argue that an impeachment that doesn't result in conviction in the Senate will only help Mr. Trump. They plan to investigate accusations of wrongdoing and let the process unfold. Republicans criticized Ms. Pelosi for not censuring Ms. Tlaib, while Mr. Trump called her comments disgraceful and disrespectful. Some House Democrats have formally introduced articles of impeachment, but others argue for a cautious approach to avoid making Mr. Trump a martyr. The episode highlights the deep divisions in Washington and the challenges faced by Democrats as they navigate their new majority power.
