Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. It's about the recent events in Washington regarding the possibility of impeaching President Trump. The article starts with Representative Rashida Tlaib making some strong statements about impeaching Trump during a celebration after the new Congress was sworn in. Her comments included some expletives, which caused a stir.

Then, President Trump addressed the issue in a press conference, bringing up impeachment discussions with Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi and other Democrats are cautious, saying it's too early and politically risky. They want to wait for the Mueller investigation results. Meanwhile, Republicans are criticizing Tlaib, some with racial overtones, and trying to paint Democrats as out to get Trump.

Tlaib stands by her comments, and other Democrats have introduced articles of impeachment, focusing on obstruction of justice. Pelosi and others believe impeachment should be based on evidence and not be politically motivated. The article also mentions the constitutional process, needing a majority in the House and two-thirds in the Senate.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: Tlaib's remarks, Trump's response, Pelosi's caution, the Democrats' stance, Republican reactions, and the potential legal basis for impeachment. I'll make sure to mention the divide within the party and the cautious approach from leadership.

Let me structure it: start with Tlaib's comments, then Trump's reaction, Pelosi's response, the cautious approach from Democrats, Republican criticism, and the ongoing investigations. Keep it concise and make sure it flows well.
