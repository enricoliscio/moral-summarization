SUMMARY:

A freshman House Democrat, Rashida Tlaib, sparked controversy by promising to impeach President Trump in an expletive-laden speech, which was captured on camera. The episode prompted Trump to ask Speaker Nancy Pelosi if Democrats planned to impeach him, and Republicans to criticize Tlaib, with some racially tinged comments. Democratic leaders, who view impeachment discussions as premature, tried to downplay the issue, but Trump dived into the conversation, saying he wasn't worried about impeachment. Tlaib stood by her comments, saying she would always "speak truth to power." While some Democrats sympathized with her sentiments, others, including Pelosi, cautioned against rushing into impeachment, fearing it could backfire and strengthen Trump in the 2020 campaign. Instead, they plan to open multiple investigations into accusations of wrongdoing around the president and his administration.
