Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want me to first identify all the single words in the article that have a moral connotation. Then, I need to write a summary that includes as many of those morally framed words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral implications. Words like "impeachment," "expletive-laden," "profanely," "foul-mouthed," "Islamic," "out-of-control," "truth to power," "dishonored," "disrespectful," "martyr," "fairer," "corruption," "obstruction," "treason," "bribery," "high crimes," "misdemeanors," "just," "unjust," "morally," "ethically," "legitimate," "illegitimate," "abuse," "abuse of power," "fairness," "unfair," "integrity," "dishonesty," "hypocrisy," "compromised," "compromised integrity," "abuse," "abuse of power," "fairness," "unfair," "integrity," "dishonesty," "hypocrisy," "compromised," "compromised integrity," "abuse," "abuse of power," "fairness," "unfair," "integrity," "dishonesty," "hypocrisy," "compromised," "compromised integrity."

Wait, that's a lot. Maybe I should look for words that are explicitly moral, like "dishonesty," "hypocrisy," "corruption," "obstruction," "treason," "bribery," "high crimes," "misdemeanors," "fair," "unfair," "integrity," "dishonored," "disrespectful," "martyr," "truth," "power," "abuse," "abuse of power," "fairer," "corruption," "obstruction," "treason," "bribery," "high crimes," "misdemeanors," "just," "unjust," "morally," "ethically," "legitimate," "illegitimate," "abuse," "abuse of power," "fairness," "unfair," "integrity," "dishonesty," "hypocrisy," "compromised," "compromised integrity."

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words while concisely summarizing the article. The article talks about Representative Tlaib's expletive-laden promise to impeach Trump, the reaction from both parties, and the moral implications surrounding impeachment discussions. It also covers Trump's response, the potential political consequences, and the stance of Democratic leaders.

I should structure the summary to include the key events and the moral framing words. Start with Tlaib's promise, mention the expletives, then the reactions from Republicans and Democrats. Highlight the moral issues like obstruction, corruption, and the potential for impeachment. Also, include the points about fairness, integrity, and the risks of backfire if impeachment doesn't lead to conviction.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally while incorporating as many of the moral words as possible without making it forced. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence includes relevant moral terms.
