SUMMARY: Impeachment talk is already dominating the early days of the new Congress, with freshman Democrat Rashida Tlaib's profanity-laden promise to impeach President Trump setting the tone. Republicans have criticized Tlaib's comments as disgraceful and racially tinged, while Democratic leaders have tried to downplay impeachment speculation as premature. Despite this, Trump has openly embraced the impeachment discussion, even asking Speaker Nancy Pelosi if Democrats planned to impeach him. Tlaib's comments reflect the growing pressure from the left to hold Trump accountable for potential wrongdoing, but Democratic leaders worry that impeachment could backfire without a reasonable chance of conviction in the Senate. The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors, and many Democrats believe Trump has threatened democratic institutions and may have obstructed justice or colluded with Russia. The impeachment debate highlights the deep divisions in Washington and sets the stage for a contentious political battle in the coming months.
