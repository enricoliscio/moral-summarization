SUMMARY:
In a divided Washington, a freshman House Democrat's exuberant and expletive-laden promise to impeach President Trump has sparked controversy. Representative Rashida Tlaib's remarks, which included a profanity, were met with criticism from Republicans, who portrayed Democrats as out to destroy Trump's presidency. Democratic leaders, who view impeachment discussions as premature, offered worried words to tamp down speculation about their intentions. Trump, however, dived into the conversation, asking Speaker Nancy Pelosi if Democrats planned to impeach him. The episode has highlighted the pressure from the left, where a majority of liberals want the president removed from office. Tlaib's outburst, which she refused to apologize for, has been labeled as "disgraceful" and "disrespectful" by Trump. The incident has sparked a heated debate, with Democrats planning to open multiple investigations into accusations of wrongdoing around the president, his campaign, and his administration.
