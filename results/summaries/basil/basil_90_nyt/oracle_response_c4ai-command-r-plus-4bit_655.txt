SUMMARY: Freshman House Democrat Rashida Tlaib's exuberant impeachment promise has upended the bonhomie of the new Congress and prompted President Trump to ask Speaker Nancy Pelosi if Democrats planned to impeach him. Republicans have criticized Tlaib's comments, with some racially tinged attacks, while Democratic leaders have tried to tamp down speculation about impeachment, believing that an impeachment that does not result in conviction will backfire. Despite this, Tlaib has stood by her comments, and other House Democrats have introduced articles of impeachment, charging Trump with obstruction of justice. The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach for "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors," but what constitutes such crimes is defined by the majority party. Pelosi has stated that Democrats shouldn't impeach for political reasons, but also shouldn't avoid impeachment for political reasons. Trump has embraced the issue, asking how a president who won a great election could be impeached, while also criticizing Tlaib's comments as disgraceful and disrespectful. The episode highlights the growing pressure on Democrats from the left to take action against Trump, even as leaders try to proceed cautiously to avoid backlash from Trump supporters.
END OF SUMMARY.
