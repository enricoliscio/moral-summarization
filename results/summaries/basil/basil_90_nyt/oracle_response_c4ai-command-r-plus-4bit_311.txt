SUMMARY: Freshman Democrat Rashida Tlaib's exuberant impeachment promise has upended the mood in Washington, prompting President Trump to ask Speaker Nancy Pelosi if Democrats planned to impeach him. Tlaib's comments sparked criticism from Republicans, who portrayed Democrats as seeking to destroy Trump's presidency. The episode has brought to the fore the question of whether Democrats should impeach Trump, with some arguing that it could strengthen him politically. Despite pressure from the left, Democratic leaders have tried to tamp down speculation, arguing that it is too early to consider impeachment and that an unsuccessful impeachment attempt could backfire. However, some House Democrats have already formally introduced articles of impeachment, charging Trump with obstruction of justice. The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors, but the decision to impeach is a politically fraught one. Pelosi has emphasized that impeachment should not be pursued for political reasons, but also stated that Democrats will "have to see how it comes." The episode highlights the divided nature of Washington and the challenges facing Democrats as they assume control of the House.
END OF SUMMARY.
