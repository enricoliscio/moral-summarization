SUMMARY:

A freshman House Democrat, Rashida Tlaib, sparked controversy by promising to impeach President Trump in an expletive-laden speech, prompting Trump to ask Speaker Nancy Pelosi if Democrats planned to impeach him. Republicans criticized Tlaib, with some comments racially tinged, while Democratic leaders distanced themselves from her remarks, viewing discussion of impeachment as premature and politically dangerous. Trump, however, dived into the conversation, saying he wouldn't be impeached because he's doing a great job. Tlaib stood by her comments, saying she would always speak truth to power. Democratic leaders, including Pelosi and Jerrold Nadler, believe it's too early to consider impeachment, wanting to wait for the findings of the special counsel's investigation. They plan to open multiple investigations into accusations of wrongdoing around Trump, but are cautious not to strengthen him in the 2020 campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
