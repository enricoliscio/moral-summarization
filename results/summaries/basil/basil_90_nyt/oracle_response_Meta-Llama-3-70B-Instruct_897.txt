SUMMARY:

A freshman House Democrat, Rashida Tlaib, sparked controversy by promising to impeach President Trump with expletive language, prompting criticism from Republicans and worry from Democratic leaders. Trump, feeling threatened, brought up impeachment in a meeting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who downplayed the discussion. Tlaib's words were seen as premature and out of line with Democratic talking points, which emphasize waiting for the findings of the special counsel's investigation. Many Democrats, including Pelosi, believe Trump is threatening democratic institutions and may have obstructed justice or collaborated with Russians, but they argue that an impeachment without a reasonable shot of winning a conviction in the Senate will backfire. Republicans, meanwhile, pounced on Tlaib's behavior, with Trump calling her comments "disgraceful" and "disrespectful to the United States of America." The episode highlights the pressure mounting from the left to impeach Trump, despite Democratic leaders' caution.
