SUMMARY: A freshman Democrat's exuberant impeachment promise has upended the new Congress and prompted discussion of impeachment between President Trump and Speaker Pelosi. Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan was captured on camera promising to impeach Trump, drawing criticism from Republicans and worry from Democratic leaders who view impeachment talk as premature and politically dangerous. Trump has embraced the issue, asking Pelosi if Democrats planned to impeach him and later asserting that impeachment is not possible if a president is "doing a great job." Pelosi and other Democrats argue that an impeachment that does not result in conviction in the Senate will backfire and strengthen Trump. They plan to open investigations into accusations of wrongdoing, obstruction of justice, and collaboration with Russia around Trump, his campaign, and his administration. Tlaib's comments reflect pressure mounting from the left, where many want the president removed from office. The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach for "treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors," but what constitutes such crimes is defined by the majority party. Republicans have criticized Tlaib's comments as disgraceful and disrespectful, with some using racially tinged language. Democrats are divided between those who want to proceed with caution and those who want to impeach Trump as soon as possible.
