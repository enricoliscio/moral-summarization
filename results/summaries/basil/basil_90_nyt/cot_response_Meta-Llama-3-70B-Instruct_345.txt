SUMMARY:
A freshman House Democrat, Rashida Tlaib, sparked controversy with her expletive-laden promise to impeach President Trump, prompting him to ask the newly elected speaker if Democrats planned to impeach him. Republicans pounced on the opportunity to portray Democrats as out to destroy Trump's presidency, with some criticism racially tinged. Democratic leaders, who view discussion of impeachment as premature and dangerous, tried to tamp down speculation about their intentions. However, Tlaib stood by her comments, proclaiming that she will always speak truth to power and fashioning her own hashtag, #unapologeticallyme. While some Democrats expressed sympathy for her sentiments, they also emphasized the need for a fair and thorough investigation to avoid making a martyr out of Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
