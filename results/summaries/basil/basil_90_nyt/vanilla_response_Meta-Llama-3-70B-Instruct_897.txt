SUMMARY:

A freshman House Democrat, Rashida Tlaib, sparked controversy by promising to impeach President Trump with an expletive-laden speech, prompting Trump to ask Speaker Nancy Pelosi if Democrats planned to impeach him. Republicans criticized Tlaib, with some comments being racially tinged. Democratic leaders, who view impeachment discussions as premature, tried to downplay the issue. Trump, however, dove into the conversation, claiming Pelosi said they weren't looking to impeach him, which her aides disputed. Trump also tweeted that you can't impeach someone who is doing a great job. Tlaib stood by her comments, saying she would always speak truth to power. While some Democrats sympathized with her sentiments, they also cautioned against making Trump a martyr. The episode highlights the divisions in Washington and the pressure from the left to impeach Trump.
