SUMMARY:

The newly elected Congress has been thrown into turmoil after freshman House Democrat Rashida Tlaib's expletive-laden promise to impeach President Trump. The episode has sparked a heated debate, with Republicans accusing Democrats of being out to destroy Trump's presidency. Democratic leaders, however, are cautious, viewing discussion of impeachment as premature and potentially politically dangerous. Trump, meanwhile, has dived into the conversation, claiming that an impeachment fight would help him politically. The incident has highlighted the pressure mounting from the left, where a majority of liberals want the president removed from office. While some Democrats have expressed sympathy with Tlaib's sentiments, they argue that an impeachment that does not have a reasonable shot of winning a conviction in the Senate will backfire and strengthen Trump in the 2020 campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
