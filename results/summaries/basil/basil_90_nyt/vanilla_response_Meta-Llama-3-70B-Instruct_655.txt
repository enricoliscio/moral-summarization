SUMMARY:

A freshman House Democrat, Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, sparked controversy by using expletive language to promise impeachment of President Trump. The episode unfolded just hours after the 116th Congress was sworn in, prompting Trump to ask Speaker Nancy Pelosi if Democrats planned to impeach him. Republicans criticized Tlaib, with some comments being racially tinged, while Democratic leaders distanced themselves from her remarks, viewing discussion of impeachment as premature. Trump, however, dove into the conversation, suggesting that an impeachment fight could help him politically. Tlaib stood by her comments, saying she would "always speak truth to power." While many Democrats share her sentiments, party elders believe it's too early to consider impeachment and want to wait for the findings of the special counsel's investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
