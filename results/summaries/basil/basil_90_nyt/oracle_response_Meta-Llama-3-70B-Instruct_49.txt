SUMMARY:

The impeachment debate has ignited in Washington, with a freshman House Democrat's expletive-laden promise to impeach President Trump sparking criticism from Republicans. The episode began when Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan vowed to impeach Trump, prompting the President to ask the newly elected speaker if Democrats planned to impeach him. Republicans pounced on Tlaib's comments, with some criticism racially tinged. Democratic leaders, who view discussion of impeachment as politically dangerous, offered worried words to tamp down speculation about their intentions. Trump, however, dived into the conversation headfirst, asserting that "you can't impeach somebody who is doing a great job." The President's frank embrace of the issue was another astonishing development, with senior Democrats saying they were determined not to take the bait and risk generating a backlash from Trump's supporters. The words of Tlaib, who stood by her comments, made evident the pressure already mounting from the left, where public opinion polls suggest a majority of liberals want the President removed from office.

END OF SUMMARY.
