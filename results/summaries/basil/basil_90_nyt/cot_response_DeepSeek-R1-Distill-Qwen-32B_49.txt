Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two main steps: first, identifying all the morally framed single words, and then writing a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Starting with Step 1, I'll go through the article and look for words that carry moral connotations. Words like "impeachment," "exuberant," "expletive-laden," "profanely," "destroy," "foul-mouthed," "Islamic," "backlash," "outrage," "truth," "power," "grandmother," "dishonored," "disrespectful," "obstruction," "justice," "misdemeanor," "martyr," "fairer," and "deserves." These words reflect the moral judgments and emotions present in the article.

For the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less, making sure to include these morally framed words. The key points are Rashida Tlaib's expletive-laden promise to impeach Trump, the resulting political backlash, Trump's and Republican reactions, Democratic leaders' caution, and the broader implications of impeachment discussions. I'll structure the summary to highlight these elements, ensuring the moral language is preserved to convey the original tone and framing.

I should also be concise, focusing on the main events and reactions without getting bogged down in details. It's important to balance between including all necessary moral terms and maintaining a coherent, concise summary. I'll make sure to mention the divide within the Democratic party, the potential political risks, and the ongoing investigations, all while keeping the language as per the original article's moral perspective.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article details the fallout from Representative Rashida Tlaib’s expletive-laden promise to impeach President Trump, which sparked widespread backlash and political tension. Trump directly addressed the issue, questioning Democrats’ intentions, while Republicans criticized Tlaib’s comments, some with racially tinged remarks. Democratic leaders, including Nancy Pelosi, distanced themselves from Tlaib’s outburst, emphasizing that impeachment discussions are premature and politically risky. Tlaib defended her remarks, asserting she speaks "truth to power." Meanwhile, Trump’s supporters view impeachment as an overreaction, and Democrats fear it could backfire. Some House Democrats, like Brad Sherman and Al Green, have already introduced articles of impeachment, focusing on obstruction of justice. Pelosi and others caution against rushing into impeachment without sufficient evidence, fearing it could strengthen Trump politically. The article highlights the moral and political divides surrounding impeachment, with Democrats balancing the need for accountability against the risks of polarizing the nation.
