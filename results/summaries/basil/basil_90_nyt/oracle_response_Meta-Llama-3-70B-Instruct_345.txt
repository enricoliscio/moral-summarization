SUMMARY:

A freshman House Democrat, Representative Rashida Tlaib, sparked controversy with her expletive-laden promise to impeach President Trump, prompting criticism from Republicans and concern from Democratic leaders. Tlaib's comments were seen as threatening to destroy Trump's presidency, and Republicans piled on criticism, some of it racially tinged. Democratic leaders, who view discussion of impeachment as premature, offered worried words to tamp down speculation about their intentions. Trump, however, dived into the conversation, asking if Democrats planned to impeach him and claiming that "you can't impeach somebody who is doing a great job." Tlaib stood by her comments, proclaiming that "I will always speak truth to power." The episode has highlighted the pressure mounting from the left, where public opinion polls suggest a majority of liberals want the president removed from office. Democratic leaders believe Trump is threatening the country's democratic institutions, but argue that an impeachment that does not have a reasonable shot of winning a conviction in the Senate will backfire and strengthen Trump in the 2020 campaign.
