Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about the recent events in Washington involving impeachment talk after a new Congress started. A freshman Democrat, Rashida Tlaib, made some strong statements about impeaching Trump, which caused a stir. Trump responded by bringing it up in a meeting with Pelosi, and the Democrats are divided on whether to pursue impeachment now.

So, the key points are: Tlaib's expletive-laden promise to impeach Trump, the reaction from Trump and Republicans, Pelosi's stance against premature impeachment, the legal context of impeachment, and the broader political implications. I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the main actors and the conflict between the parties.

I should start by mentioning Tlaib's statement and its impact. Then, describe Trump's response and the Republican reaction. Next, cover Pelosi's position and the Democratic leaders' caution. Also, include the legal aspects and the ongoing investigations. Finally, touch on the political strategy and the potential consequences of impeachment attempts.

I need to keep the summary concise, so I'll focus on the most critical details without getting bogged down in specifics. Make sure it flows logically from one point to the next, ending with the implications for both parties and the process moving forward.

SUMMARY: A freshman House Democrat, Rashida Tlaib, sparked controversy by vowing to impeach President Trump during a celebration after the 116th Congress was sworn in. Her expletive-laden promise drew cheers from liberal activists but prompted Trump to ask Speaker Nancy Pelosi if Democrats planned to impeach him. Trump addressed the issue openly at a news conference, asserting that a president doing a "great job" couldn't be impeached. Pelosi and other Democrats dismissed the idea, emphasizing the need to wait for the findings of the Mueller investigation. Tlaib defended her remarks, stating she would "always speak truth to power." Meanwhile, other Democrats, including Representatives Brad Sherman and Al Green, introduced articles of impeachment, focusing on obstruction of justice. While some Democrats support impeachment, others caution against premature action, fearing political backlash. The situation highlights the growing divide in Washington and the potential risks of pursuing impeachment without a clear path to conviction in the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
