Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the recent events surrounding the impeachment discussions in the U.S. Congress. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It starts with Rep. Rashida Tlaib making an expletive-laden promise to impeach Trump, which caused a stir. Trump then brought up impeachment during a meeting with Pelosi, and the Democrats are divided on whether to pursue it. There's also mention of the legal implications and the political strategy behind impeachment.

I need to capture the main elements: Tlaib's statement, Trump's reaction, the Democratic leaders' stance, the legal issues, and the political implications. Also, I should highlight the moral aspects, like the potential for backlash and the Democrats' cautious approach.

I should structure the summary to include the initial event, the reactions from both sides, the political strategies, and the broader implications. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and ensuring the moral framing is clear.

Let me start drafting. I'll mention Tlaib's promise, the subsequent reactions, the Democrats' caution, Trump's comments, and the ongoing investigations. I'll also note the political risks involved.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically and covers all critical points without getting too detailed. I'll avoid jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: A freshman House Democrat, Rashida Tlaib, sparked controversy by vowing to impeach President Trump in a profane outburst shortly after the new Congress was sworn in. This led Trump to inquire with Speaker Nancy Pelosi about impeachment plans during a meeting to discuss the government shutdown. Pelosi denied any intention to impeach, but Trump's openness to the topic highlighted the political stakes. While Tlaib and others on the left advocate for impeachment, Democratic leaders caution against premature action, fearing political backlash. They emphasize following the facts and waiting for the Mueller investigation. Republicans, meanwhile, criticize Tlaib's remarks, with some making racially tinged comments. The situation underscores the tension between Democratic unity and the pressure from progressive constituents to confront Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
