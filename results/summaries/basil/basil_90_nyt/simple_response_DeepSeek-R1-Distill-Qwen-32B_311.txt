Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. The user specified that I should preserve the moral framing the author provided. So, first, I'll read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the underlying moral perspectives.

The article discusses the recent events around impeachment in the U.S. Congress. It starts with Rashida Tlaib's expletive-laden promise to impeach Trump, which caused a stir. I notice that the author presents both sides: the Democrats' internal conflict between those eager to impeach and those cautious about the political implications, and the Republicans' reaction, which includes some racially tinged criticism.

I should highlight the moral framing here. The author seems to critique the political tactics, especially the Democrats' hesitation despite potential evidence, and the Republicans' use of race and religion against Tlaib. The summary needs to reflect this tension without bias, showing both the enthusiasm from the left and the cautious approach from party leaders.

I'll structure the summary to include the main events: Tlaib's statement, Trump's response, the differing opinions within the Democratic party, and the broader implications of impeachment. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the moral nuances, such as the criticism of Tlaib and the strategic considerations of the Democrats.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." while maintaining clarity and brevity.

SUMMARY: A freshman House Democrat, Rashida Tlaib, sparked controversy by vowing to impeach President Trump during a celebration near the Capitol, using profane language. Her comments escalated tensions, prompting Trump to inquire with Speaker Nancy Pelosi about impeachment plans. While Pelosi and other Democrats dismissed the idea as premature and politically risky, Tlaib defended her remarks, emphasizing her commitment to "truth to power." Republicans criticized her, with some comments tinged with racial and religious undertones. Trump, meanwhile, framed impeachment as a political tool, asserting his administration's success. Pelosi and party leaders argue that pursuing impeachment without sufficient evidence could backfire, especially with a Republican-controlled Senate. However, progressive Democrats, including Tlaib and others, are pushing for impeachment proceedings, citing potential legal violations. The episode highlights the growing divide within the Democratic party over how to address Trump's presidency, with some advocating for immediate action while others caution against political overreach. END OF SUMMARY.
