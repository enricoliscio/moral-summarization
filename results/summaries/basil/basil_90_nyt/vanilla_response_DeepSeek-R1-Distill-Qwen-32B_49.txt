Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the recent events surrounding impeachment discussions in the U.S. Congress after the 116th Congress was sworn in. 

So, it starts with Representative Rashida Tlaib making a profane promise to impeach Trump at a bar near the Capitol. This caused a stir, leading Trump to bring up impeachment during a meeting with Pelosi about the government shutdown. Trump asked Pelosi if they planned to impeach him, and she denied it. However, her aides say Trump brought it up first, and they were focused on reopening the government.

The article mentions that while some Democrats, especially liberals, want to impeach Trump, the leadership is cautious. They don't want to risk a political backlash. Pelosi and others believe it's too early and want to wait for Mueller's findings. Meanwhile, Republicans are using Tlaib's comments to paint Democrats as out to get Trump.

Tlaib herself stands by her comments, saying she speaks truth to power. Other Democrats, like Sherman and Green, have introduced impeachment articles, focusing on obstruction of justice. Pelosi and others are planning investigations but are cautious about the political implications.

I need to condense all this into a 200-word summary. I should include the key points: Tlaib's statement, Trump's reaction, Pelosi's response, the cautious approach of Democratic leadership, the split within the party, and the broader implications of impeachment discussions.

Let me structure it step by step. First, the event with Tlaib. Then Trump bringing it up with Pelosi. Her denial and the aides' clarification. The split between the left wanting impeachment and leadership being cautious. Mention the legal issues and Mueller's investigation. Also, the Republican reaction and the cautious approach of Democrats to avoid political backlash.

I need to make sure it's concise and covers all these points without going over 200 words. I'll start with the event, move to the reactions, then the cautious approach, and end with the split and Republican response.
