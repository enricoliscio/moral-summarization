Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, it's about the recent events surrounding the new Congress and the topic of impeaching President Trump. Rashida Tlaib made some strong statements, which caused a stir. Trump responded by bringing up impeachment during a meeting with Pelosi. Democrats are divided on whether to pursue impeachment now or wait.

I should highlight the key players: Tlaib, Trump, Pelosi, and the reactions from both parties. Also, mention the moral implications, like the risks of impeachment and the potential political fallout. I need to keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure it: start with Tlaib's comments, Trump's reaction, Pelosi's stance, the debate within the party, and the broader implications. Make sure to include the moral framing, such as the potential for backlash and the importance of following the facts.

I'll make sure the summary is concise and captures all the essential points without getting too detailed. Also, check that it flows well and ends properly with the tokens.

SUMMARY: A freshman House Democrat, Rashida Tlaib, sparked controversy by vowing to impeach President Trump during a celebration shortly after the new Congress was sworn in. Her expletive-laden promise drew criticism, with some Republicans framing it as an attack on Trump's presidency, while Democrats cautioned against premature impeachment discussions. Trump addressed the issue during a news conference, suggesting Democrats might use impeachment as a political tool, though Pelosi denied this. Tlaib stood by her remarks, emphasizing her commitment to "speak truth to power." Meanwhile, other Democrats, including Brad Sherman and Al Green, introduced formal impeachment articles, while party leaders like Pelosi and Nadler argued for patience, awaiting Mueller's findings. The episode highlighted growing divisions within the party and the political risks of pursuing impeachment, with Trump's supporters likely viewing it as an overreach. END OF SUMMARY.
