SUMMARY:

A freshman House Democrat, Rashida Tlaib, sparked controversy by using expletive language to promise impeachment of President Trump. The episode prompted Trump to ask Speaker Nancy Pelosi if Democrats planned to impeach him. Republicans criticized Tlaib, with some comments being racially tinged. Democratic leaders, who view impeachment discussions as premature, tried to downplay the issue. Trump, however, dove into the conversation, claiming Pelosi said Democrats weren't looking to impeach him, which Pelosi's aides disputed. Tlaib stood by her comments, saying she would "always speak truth to power." While some Democrats sympathized with Tlaib's sentiments, many believe it's too early to consider impeachment and want to wait for the findings of the special counsel's investigation. The episode highlights the pressure from the left to remove Trump from office, but Democratic leaders are cautious not to generate a backlash from Trump's supporters.
