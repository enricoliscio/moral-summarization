SUMMARY:
The newly elected Congress was quickly divided over impeachment after a freshman House Democrat, Rashida Tlaib, made an exuberant and expletive-laden promise to impeach President Trump. Republicans pounced on the opportunity to portray Democrats as out to destroy Trump's presidency, with some criticism being racially tinged. Democratic leaders, who view discussion of impeachment as premature and dangerous, offered worried words to tamp down speculation about their intentions. Trump, however, dived into the conversation head-first, asking if Democrats planned to impeach him. The episode has brought to the forefront the pressure from the left to remove Trump from office, with many liberals wanting him impeached. While Democratic leaders believe Trump is threatening the country's democratic institutions, they also argue that an impeachment without a reasonable shot of winning a conviction in the Senate will backfire and strengthen Trump in the 2020 campaign.
