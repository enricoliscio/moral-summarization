SUMMARY: This week, Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan made headlines by promising to impeach President Trump, using profanity to express her determination. This incident sparked a heated debate among Republicans and Democrats, with Republicans criticizing Ms. Tlaib's comments and Democrats offering more measured responses. President Trump openly embraced the topic of impeachment during a news conference, claiming that Speaker Nancy Pelosi had assured him that Democrats were not planning to impeach him. However, Democratic leaders have tried to shift the focus away from impeachment, arguing that it is too early to consider it. Despite this, some House Democrats have already introduced articles of impeachment, and Ms. Tlaib has stood by her comments. The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach officials for "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors." While many Democrats believe Mr. Trump has threatened democratic institutions and may have obstructed justice, they also argue that an unsuccessful impeachment attempt could strengthen Mr. Trump's position in the 2020 election.
END OF SUMMARY.
