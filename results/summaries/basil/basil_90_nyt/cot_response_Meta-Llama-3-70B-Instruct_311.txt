SUMMARY:
The newly elected Congress was quickly divided over impeachment, sparked by freshman Democrat Rashida Tlaib's expletive-laden promise to impeach President Trump. Republicans pounced on her remarks, calling them "foul-mouthed" and "disrespectful." Democratic leaders, however, were worried about appearing "out-of-control" and premature in discussing impeachment. Trump, sensing an opportunity, dove headfirst into the conversation, asking if Democrats planned to impeach him. He claimed that Speaker Nancy Pelosi reassured him that they weren't, but senior aides disputed this characterization. The episode highlighted the pressure from the left to remove Trump from office, with many Democrats believing he has "dishonored" the presidency. Despite this, party leaders are cautious, fearing an impeachment fight could backfire and strengthen Trump in the 2020 campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
