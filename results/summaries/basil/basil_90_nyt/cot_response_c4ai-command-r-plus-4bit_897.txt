SUMMARY: Impeachment was bound to be a divisive issue in Washington, and it didn't take long for it to become a heated topic. Just hours after the new Congress was sworn in, Representative Rashida Tlaib's impassioned and profane promise to impeach President Trump ignited a firestorm. Republicans were quick to pounce on Tlaib's remarks, with some even using racially tinged criticism. Democratic leaders, worried about the political dangers of impeachment, tried to tamp down speculation, but Trump himself eagerly embraced the issue, even bringing it up with Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Despite the divided opinions within the Democratic Party, many harbor suspicions of obstruction of justice and collaboration with Russia. They fear that an impeachment attempt without a reasonable chance of conviction will only strengthen Trump's position. In the meantime, they plan to investigate accusations of wrongdoing within the administration. The episode highlights the peril of impeachment for both parties and the divided nature of Washington.
