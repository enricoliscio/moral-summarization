Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to identify the morally framed words first. Let me start by reading through the article carefully. 

The article talks about the debate between Obama and Romney-Ryan over Medicare. It mentions terms like "devastating," "dishonest," "hypocritical," "raid," "cuts," "end Medicare as we know it," "guaranteed benefits," "savings," "repeal," "restore," "committed," "solvency," "fiscal challenges," "fixed amount," "rationing," and "endanger." These words seem to carry moral connotations because they're used to criticize or defend the policies.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise. I'll start by outlining the main points: the budget plans, the accusations from both sides, the use of savings, and the methods to control costs. I'll make sure to mention the moral framing words to reflect the author's perspective.

I should structure the summary to show the conflict, the accusations, the plans, and the implications. I'll need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms without being too wordy.

**SUMMARY:**
The article discusses the heated debate over Medicare between Obama and Romney-Ryan. Romney and Ryan claim Obama's Affordable Care Act "raids" Medicare by cutting $716 billion, which they argue is "devastating" for seniors. Obama's campaign counters that Romney's plan would "end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries, calling the Republican claims "dishonest" and "hypocritical." Both sides use similar "savings" but allocate them differently: Obama to cover the uninsured, Ryan to reduce deficits. Democrats accuse Republicans of "repealing" new Medicare benefits, while Republicans aim to "restore" funding. The debate centers on controlling costs, with Romney-Ryan proposing a fixed government contribution for private insurance or traditional Medicare, versus Obama's approach of reducing payments to providers and a cost control board. Romney-Ryan seek to "abolish" the board, calling it a tool for "rationing," while Democrats warn against "endangering" Medicare's future. The moral framing highlights accusations of fiscal irresponsibility and neglect of seniors' health care needs. END OF SUMMARY.
