SUMMARY:
The Obama campaign has accused Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan of being "dishonest" and "hypocritical" in their Medicare plan, which they claim would "end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. The Republicans have hit back with a TV commercial asserting that the Romney-Ryan plan is better for older Americans, claiming that President Obama's health care law has "raided" Medicare of $716 billion to pay for Obamacare. However, the Obama campaign argues that the savings do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit. Ryan's budget plan, which Romney has endorsed, assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as Obama's health care law, but would use the money to "shore up Medicare" and reduce budget deficits. The debate centers on changes to the program made in the Affordable Care Act, with both parties trying to "protect" and "strengthen" Medicare.
