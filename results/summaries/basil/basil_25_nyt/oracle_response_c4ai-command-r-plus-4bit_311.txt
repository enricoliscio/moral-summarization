SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare has become a focal point in the political race, with the Obama campaign accusing the Romney-Ryan plan of "ending Medicare as we know it" and shifting costs to beneficiaries. The Republicans have countered with an ad claiming that Obama's cuts to Medicare are devastating to older Americans and will impact their guaranteed health care. The Obama campaign has called the ad dishonest and hypocritical, arguing that the savings do not cut Medicare benefits. The debate centers on the Affordable Care Act, with Democrats pointing out that the Ryan budget plan includes similar savings by assuming repeal of the expansions in the Affordable Care Act. The Romney-Ryan plan would limit the government's financial commitment to Medicare, while the Affordable Care Act reduces projected payments to providers and creates a cost control board. The moral framing in this debate centers around words like "devastating," "end," "shift," "cut," "dishonest," "hypocritical," "save," "protect," "shore," "reduce," "raided," "solvency," "wipe," "restore," "squeezed," "repealing," "ending," "raid," and "rationing." Both sides claim to be protecting Medicare and improving its financial condition, but disagree on the methods and the impact on beneficiaries.
END OF SUMMARY.
