SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare and its future has become a key issue in the political race between Mitt Romney and President Obama, with both sides accusing the other of jeopardizing the program. The Obama campaign has criticized the Romney-Ryan budget plan, arguing that it would "end Medicare as we know it" and increase costs for beneficiaries. The Romney-Ryan campaign has countered with advertisements claiming that Obama's health care law cuts $716 billion from Medicare to fund his signature health program. This has sparked a moral debate about the fairness and consequences of these proposed changes. The Obama campaign defends their approach by stating that their savings do not cut any guaranteed Medicare benefits. On the other hand, the Romney-Ryan plan proposes to limit the government's financial commitment to Medicare by providing a fixed amount of money per beneficiary, allowing them to purchase private insurance or cover traditional Medicare costs. This debate centers on the moral obligation to protect the well-being of older Americans while also addressing the nation's fiscal challenges. Both sides present different visions for the future of Medicare, each claiming to be the true defenders of the program and the interests of its beneficiaries.
