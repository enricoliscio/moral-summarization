SUMMARY: Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan claim that Barack Obama's health care law is devastating to millions of older Americans on Medicare, as it assumes Medicare savings. Obama's campaign counters that Romney's plan would "end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. The Republicans responded with an ad accusing Obama of cutting Medicare to pay for his health care law. The Obama campaign called the ad dishonest and hypocritical, arguing that the savings do not cut guaranteed Medicare benefits. Ryan welcomed the debate, stating that his plan would save, protect, and strengthen Medicare. With 50 million beneficiaries, Medicare is a major concern for both parties. The dispute centers on changes to the program made in the Affordable Care Act, passed without Republican votes in 2010. Obama aims to use the savings to offset the cost of covering the uninsured and improve Medicare's financial condition. Meanwhile, Ryan intends to use the savings to shore up Medicare and reduce deficits. Democrats accuse Republicans of raiding Medicare, while Republicans counter that the Affordable Care Act includes similar savings. The Ryan budget plan, approved by the House, assumes these savings and devotes them to deficit reduction and Medicare solvency. Romney and Ryan propose to limit the government's open-ended financial commitment to Medicare by contributing a fixed amount for beneficiaries to buy private insurance or cover traditional Medicare. In contrast, Obama's health care law reduces projected payments to providers and creates a Medicare cost control board. Romney and Ryan aim to abolish this board, which they view as rationing health care.
