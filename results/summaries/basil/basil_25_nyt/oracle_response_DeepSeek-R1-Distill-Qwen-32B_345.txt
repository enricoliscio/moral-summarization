Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so they probably want a concise summary that reflects the ethical and value-laden language from the original text.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the debate between Obama and Romney/Ryan regarding Medicare. The key points are the budget plans, the savings, and the accusations of cutting Medicare benefits.

I notice the author uses words like "devastating," "end," "shift," "dishonest," "hypocritical," "save," "protect," "strengthen," etc. I need to include these in the summary to maintain the moral tone.

Next, I'll identify the main arguments from each side. Obama's campaign claims Romney and Ryan's plan would end Medicare as we know it, shifting costs to beneficiaries. Romney and Ryan argue their plan saves Medicare by repealing Obama's law and restoring funding.

I should structure the summary to highlight these opposing viewpoints, using the moral terms. I'll mention the $716 billion figure, the accusations of raiding Medicare, and the differing approaches to Medicare funding.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points. I'll start with the main issue, then outline each side's stance, and conclude with the implications.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows well and accurately reflects the moral framing without adding my own bias. The goal is to present both perspectives clearly while preserving the author's ethical language.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the ongoing partisan debate over Medicare, with both sides using morally charged language to frame their arguments. President Obama’s Affordable Care Act and Representative Paul D. Ryan’s budget plan both assume $700 billion in Medicare savings, but Republicans argue these cuts would be devastating for older Americans. The Obama campaign claims Romney and Ryan’s plan would end Medicare as we know it, shifting costs to beneficiaries, while Republicans counter that Obama’s law has raided Medicare to fund Obamacare. Democrats accuse Republicans of dishonesty and hypocrisy, stating the savings do not cut guaranteed benefits. Ryan defends his plan, asserting it would save, protect, and strengthen Medicare by repealing Obamacare expansions. Meanwhile, Romney vows to restore Medicare funding by repealing the Affordable Care Act. The debate centers on how to offset costs, improve Medicare’s financial solvency, and reduce deficits, with Republicans proposing a fixed government contribution for beneficiaries to purchase private insurance or traditional Medicare, while Obama’s law reduces payments to providers and creates a cost control board. Romney and Ryan aim to abolish this board, calling it a tool for rationing care. END OF SUMMARY.
