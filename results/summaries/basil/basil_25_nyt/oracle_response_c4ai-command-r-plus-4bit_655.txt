SUMMARY: The battle over Medicare has become a central issue in the political race between Mitt Romney and President Obama. Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, have criticized Obama's healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act, for cutting $716 billion from Medicare, claiming it will be devastating for older Americans. Obama's campaign has countered by arguing that the Romney-Ryan plan would "end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. The Romney-Ryan budget plan assumes similar savings to the Affordable Care Act but would use the money differently, aiming to shore up Medicare and reduce deficits. Democrats argue that repealing the Affordable Care Act would also eliminate new Medicare benefits. The debate centers on how to achieve similar constraints on Medicare spending while ensuring the protection and improvement of the program. Romney and Ryan propose limiting the government's financial commitment by providing a fixed amount for beneficiaries to purchase private insurance or use for traditional Medicare, while Obama's law reduces payments to healthcare providers with a cost control board. The moral framing of the debate revolves around words like "devastating," "end," "shift," "cut," "protect," "improve," "shore up," "reduce," and "rationing."
