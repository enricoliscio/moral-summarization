SUMMARY: The partisan brawl over Medicare between the Obama campaign and the Romney-Ryan ticket is intensifying. The Obama campaign accuses the Romney-Ryan plan of "ending Medicare as we know it" and shifting costs to beneficiaries, while the Romney-Ryan ticket counter that the Obama administration has "cut" Medicare to pay for the Affordable Care Act. The Romney-Ryan plan aims to save, protect, and strengthen Medicare by imposing spending constraints and limiting the government's financial commitment, while the Obama administration intends to offset costs and improve the financial condition of the Medicare trust fund through similar spending constraints and a Medicare cost control board. The debate centers on the moral implications of the plans, with both sides claiming to protect and improve Medicare, while accusing the other of devastating cuts and negative consequences for older Americans.
END OF SUMMARY.
