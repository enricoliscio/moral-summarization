Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the debate between Obama and Romney-Ryan regarding Medicare savings. Both sides are accusing each other of cutting Medicare funds, but for different purposes.

The article mentions that Ryan's budget assumes the same savings as Obama's law, but Romney and Ryan say these cuts are devastating. The Obama campaign claims Ryan's plan would end Medicare as we know it, shifting costs to beneficiaries. Republicans counter by saying Obama cut $716 billion for Obamacare. The Democrats argue that the savings don't cut benefits, while Republicans want to use the money to shore up Medicare and reduce deficits.

There's a history of Republicans accusing Democrats of raiding Medicare, and now Democrats are pointing out that Ryan's plan includes similar cuts. The Ryan plan changes how Medicare is funded, moving to fixed contributions, while Obama's law reduces payments to providers and has a cost control board, which Romney wants to abolish.

I need to identify the morally framed words first. Words like "devastating," "dishonest," "hypocritical," "raid," "end Medicare," "shift costs," "savings," "cuts," "repeal," "commitment," "fixed amount," "private insurance," "traditional Medicare," "rationing," "cost control board," "abolish," "solvency," "deficit reduction," "expansions," "subsidies," "low- and middle-income," "additional coverage," "preventive services," "fiscal challenges," "restore funding," "fully committed," "open-ended financial commitment," "guaranteed benefits," "shift costs," "reducing payments," "cost control board," "rationing," "abolish," "solvency," "deficit reduction," "expansions," "subsidies," "low- and middle-income," "additional coverage," "preventive services," "fiscal challenges," "restore funding," "fully committed," "open-ended financial commitment," "guaranteed benefits," "shift costs," "reducing payments," "cost control board," "rationing," "abolish," "solvency," "deficit reduction," "expansions," "subsidies," "low- and middle-income," "additional coverage," "preventive services," "fiscal challenges," "restore funding," "fully committed," "open-ended financial commitment," "guaranteed benefits," "shift costs," "reducing payments," "cost control board," "rationing," "abolish."

Now, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these morally charged words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and highlight the moral framing from both parties.

I'll start by outlining the key points: the debate over Medicare savings, accusations of cutting funds, the purpose of the savings (Obama for expanding coverage, Ryan for solvency and deficit), the history of accusations, the differences in their plans, and the moral language used by both sides.

Putting it all together, I need to ensure that the summary reflects the moral stances without getting bogged down in too much detail. I'll make sure to include words like "devastating," "dishonest," "raid," "end Medicare," "savings," "cuts," "repeal," "commitment," "fixed amount," "private insurance," "rationing," "abolish," "solvency," "deficit reduction," "expansions," "subsidies," "additional coverage," "preventive services," "fiscal challenges," "restore funding," "fully committed," "open-ended financial commitment," "guaranteed benefits," "shift costs," "reducing payments," "cost control board," "rationing," "abolish."

I'll structure the summary to first present the debate, then the accusations, followed by the differing approaches to Medicare funding, and conclude with the implications of each plan. This should encapsulate the moral framing effectively.

The article discusses the heated debate between President Obama and the Romney-Ryan ticket over Medicare savings, highlighting significant moral framing from both sides. Romney and Ryan argue that the $716 billion in Medicare cuts, as per Obama's Affordable Care Act, are devastating, while Obama's campaign accuses Ryan's plan of ending Medicare as we know it, shifting costs to beneficiaries. The Republicans counter by claiming Obama raided Medicare funds for Obamacare, asserting their plan would restore Medicare's solvency and reduce deficits. Democrats argue that the savings do not cut guaranteed benefits, emphasizing that the cuts are for expanding coverage. The Ryan plan, which Romney supports, shifts Medicare to a fixed contribution model, while Obama's law reduces payments to providers and introduces a cost control board, which Republicans criticize as rationing. The debate centers on accusations of raiding Medicare funds, the impact on beneficiaries, and the commitment to Medicare's future, with both sides using strong moral language to frame their arguments.
