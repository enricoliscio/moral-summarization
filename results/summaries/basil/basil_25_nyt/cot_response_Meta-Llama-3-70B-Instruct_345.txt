SUMMARY:
The Obama campaign accuses Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget blueprint of being "dishonest and hypocritical" for assuming the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama's health care law, despite Romney and Ryan's claims that these cuts would be "devastating" to older Americans on Medicare. The Romney campaign responds with a TV ad claiming that Obama's law "raids" Medicare to fund Obamacare, shifting costs to beneficiaries. However, the Obama campaign argues that the savings do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit. Ryan's plan would use the money to shore up Medicare and reduce budget deficits, while Obama's law would use it to cover the uninsured and improve the Medicare trust fund. The debate centers on changes to Medicare made in the Affordable Care Act, with both sides accusing each other of being dishonest about their intentions.
