Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. It's about the debate over Medicare between Obama and Romney-Ryan. The key points are the savings from Medicare, the impact on beneficiaries, and the plans to either save or end Medicare as we know it.

The author uses words like "devastating," "end," "shift," "better," etc. I need to include as many of these as possible. The article mentions that both Obama and Ryan's plans save $700 billion, but Romney says they're raiding Medicare. The Democrats argue that these savings don't cut benefits, while Republicans say it's better for older Americans.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict, the use of morally charged words, and the different approaches to Medicare. Make sure to include the key points about the savings, the accusations of cutting or raiding, and the plans to either protect or end Medicare.

Let me draft a concise version, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes the moral terms. I'll start with the debate, mention the savings, the accusations, and the contrasting plans. Conclude with the stakes involved, emphasizing the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare savings has intensified, with both sides using morally charged language. President Obama’s health care law and Representative Paul D. Ryan’s budget plan assume similar Medicare savings, but Romney and Ryan claim these cuts would be devastating for older Americans. Obama’s campaign accuses Ryan’s plan of ending Medicare as we know it, shifting costs to beneficiaries, while Republicans argue their plan is better for seniors. The savings, $716 billion from 2013 to 2022, are used by Obama to offset costs for the uninsured and improve Medicare’s financial health, while Ryan aims to shore up Medicare and reduce deficits. Republicans claim Democrats raided Medicare to fund Obamacare, but Democrats argue the savings do not cut guaranteed benefits. The Ryan plan limits government spending on Medicare, allowing beneficiaries to choose private insurance or traditional coverage, while Obama’s law reduces payments to providers and creates a cost control board, which Republicans aim to repeal. The debate centers on whether the plans save, protect, or end Medicare, with Romney vowing to restore funding and repeal Obamacare. The moral framing highlights accusations of dishonesty, hypocrisy, and rationing, as both sides tackle the fiscal challenges of Medicare. END OF SUMMARY.
