SUMMARY:

The Medicare debate continues to heat up in the presidential race. Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget plan, endorsed by Mitt Romney, assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama's healthcare law, despite Romney and Ryan's claims that these cuts would harm older Americans. The Obama campaign argues that Ryan's plan would "end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. However, Ryan's plan would use the savings to strengthen Medicare and reduce budget deficits, while Obama's plan would use the savings to cover the uninsured and improve the Medicare trust fund. Democrats point out that Ryan's plan includes similar savings to Obama's plan, roughly $700 billion from 2013 to 2022. The moral framing of this issue is clear: Democrats are accusing Republicans of being dishonest and hypocritical in their criticism of Obama's plan while proposing similar cuts themselves. Republicans, on the other hand, argue that their plan is necessary to save Medicare from bankruptcy.

END OF SUMMARY.
