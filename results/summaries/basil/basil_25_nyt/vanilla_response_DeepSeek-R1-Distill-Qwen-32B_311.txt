Okay, so the user has provided a detailed news article about the Medicare debate between Obama and Romney/Ryan. They want me to summarize it, keeping it under 200 words. 

First, I need to understand the main points. The article talks about how both Obama and Ryan's budgets assume the same Medicare savings, but they're being criticized differently. The Democrats say Romney and Ryan want to end Medicare as we know it, while Republicans argue that Obama is cutting Medicare to fund Obamacare.

I should identify the key elements: the savings amount ($716 billion), the plans to use the savings, the accusations from both sides, and the implications for Medicare beneficiaries. Also, the structure of Ryan's plan versus Obama's approach with the cost control board.

I need to condense this into a concise summary without losing the essential details. I'll start by stating that both plans assume the same savings. Then, mention the accusations from each side. Next, explain how each plan uses the savings and the structural differences. Finally, note the ongoing political battle and the impact on Medicare.

I should make sure the summary is clear and sticks to the word limit. I'll avoid jargon and keep it straightforward, ensuring all critical points are covered without getting too technical.

SUMMARY: The Medicare debate intensified as both President Obama and Representative Paul D. Ryan’s budget plans assume $700 billion in savings over a decade. Obama’s Affordable Care Act uses these savings to expand coverage and strengthen Medicare, while Ryan’s plan allocates them to reduce deficits and reform Medicare by shifting costs to beneficiaries. Romney and Ryan argue that Obama’s cuts to Medicare are devastating, while Obama’s campaign accuses their plan of ending Medicare as we know it. Republicans claim their plan is better for seniors, asserting that Obama’s law raids Medicare funds for Obamacare. Democrats counter that Ryan’s plan does not cut benefits but instead redirects savings. The debate centers on how to ensure Medicare’s solvency, with Obama’s law reducing payments to providers and creating a cost control board, while Ryan and Romney propose capping government contributions and eliminating the board. The political battle over Medicare’s future continues to dominate the race. END OF SUMMARY.
