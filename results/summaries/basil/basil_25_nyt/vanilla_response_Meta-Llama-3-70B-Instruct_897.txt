SUMMARY:

The Medicare debate continues to heat up in the presidential race. Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget plan assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama's healthcare law, despite Romney and Ryan's claims that these cuts would harm older Americans. The Obama campaign argues that Ryan's plan would "end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. The Romney campaign has released a TV ad claiming that Obama's healthcare law has cut $716 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare. However, Democrats point out that Ryan's budget plan also includes similar savings, roughly $700 billion from 2013 to 2022. Both plans aim to reduce Medicare spending, but differ in approach. Ryan's plan would limit the government's financial commitment to Medicare, while Obama's law would reduce payments to healthcare providers and create a cost control board.

END OF SUMMARY.
