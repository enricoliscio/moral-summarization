Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the debate over Medicare between Obama and Romney/Ryan. 

First, I'll identify the key points. The article mentions that both Obama and Ryan's budgets assume the same Medicare savings, around $700 billion. Romney and Ryan argue that these cuts would hurt seniors, while Obama's campaign claims their plan doesn't cut benefits. 

I should note the political ads: Obama's campaign says Ryan's plan ends Medicare as we know it, shifting costs to beneficiaries. The Romney ad accuses Obama of cutting Medicare funds for Obamacare. 

There's also a mention of the 2010 Affordable Care Act and how the savings are used differently. Obama uses them to cover the uninsured and strengthen Medicare, while Ryan uses them to reduce deficits. 

I need to highlight the moral arguments from both sides. Democrats argue that Republicans are using the same cuts but criticizing Obama for it, while Republicans say they're committed to repealing Obamacare and restoring Medicare funds.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it reflects the moral framing each side presents. I'll structure it by introducing the debate, outlining each side's stance, and concluding with the implications for Medicare's future.
