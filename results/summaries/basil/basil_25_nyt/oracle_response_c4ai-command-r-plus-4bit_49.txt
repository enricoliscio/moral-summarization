SUMMARY: Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have been accused of hypocrisy by the Obama campaign, which claims their Medicare plan would be "devastating" to older Americans. A new Romney-Ryan TV ad counters that Obama "has cut $716 billion from Medicare" to fund his health care law, while the Romney-Ryan plan would "save," "protect," and "strengthen" Medicare. The Obama campaign calls the ad "dishonest," arguing that their plan does not cut guaranteed benefits but instead improves the program. The Romney-Ryan plan would restore funding to Medicare and limit the government's financial commitment by providing beneficiaries with a fixed amount to purchase private insurance or supplement traditional coverage. Both plans aim to constrain Medicare spending, but their approaches differ, with the Romney-Ryan plan abolishing the Medicare cost control board, which they see as "rationing" health care. The debate over Medicare, affecting 50 million beneficiaries, is becoming a central issue in the race, with both sides accusing the other of jeopardizing the program's future.
END OF SUMMARY.
