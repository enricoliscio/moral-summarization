SUMMARY: Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan's shared Medicare plan is under fire from the Obama campaign, which claims it would "end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. The Romney-Ryan plan assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama's health care law, but there are key differences in how these savings would be used. While Obama would use the savings to help offset the cost of covering the uninsured and improve the Medicare trust fund, Romney and Ryan would use the money to shore up Medicare and reduce budget deficits. The Romney campaign has countered that their plan would restore funding to Medicare and protect older Americans, arguing that Obama's cuts would be devastating to those relying on the program. The fight over Medicare has become a central issue in the race, with both sides accusing the other of jeopardizing the well-being of millions of Americans. The debate centers on how best to ensure the program's long-term solvency and protect the interests of beneficiaries, with each side proposing different approaches to achieving these goals. The outcome of this debate will have significant implications for the future of Medicare and the well-being of older Americans who depend on it. END OF SUMMARY.
