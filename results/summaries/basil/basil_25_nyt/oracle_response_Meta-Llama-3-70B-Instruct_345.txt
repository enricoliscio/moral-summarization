SUMMARY:

The Medicare debate continues to intensify, with both parties accusing each other of being "devastating" to older Americans. The Obama campaign claims that Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget plan, endorsed by Mitt Romney, would "end Medicare as we know it" and "shift costs" to beneficiaries. In response, the Romney campaign released a TV ad asserting that Obama's healthcare law has "cut" $716 billion from Medicare to "pay for Obamacare." The ad claims that the money Americans paid into Medicare is now being used to fund a "massive new government program" that's not for them.

Ryan's plan assumes the same Medicare savings as Obama's healthcare law, but uses the money to "shore up" Medicare and reduce budget deficits. Democrats argue that Ryan's plan is "dishonest" and "hypocritical" since it includes similar savings. The debate centers on changes made to Medicare in the Affordable Care Act, with both parties accusing each other of "raiding" the program. The morally charged language used by both sides highlights the high stakes of this debate.

END OF SUMMARY.
