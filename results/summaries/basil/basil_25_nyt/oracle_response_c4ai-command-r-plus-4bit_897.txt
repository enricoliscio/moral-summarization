SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare has become a central issue in the political race, with the Obama campaign accusing Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan of planning to "end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. Romney and Ryan have countered by claiming that Obama's health care law cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for his own health care program. The Romney-Ryan plan, they argue, would save, protect, and strengthen Medicare. 

The dispute centers on the Affordable Care Act, which aims to improve Medicare's financial condition and expand coverage. While Democrats argue that the Ryan budget plan, endorsed by Romney, includes similar savings by assuming the repeal of expansions in the Affordable Care Act, Republicans claim that a Romney-Ryan administration would restore funding to Medicare and tackle fiscal challenges. 

The moral framing of the debate highlights the potential impact on older Americans and the perceived fairness of shifting costs or "raiding" Medicare to fund other programs. The debate also raises questions about the role of government in providing health care and the ethics of rationing health care services.
