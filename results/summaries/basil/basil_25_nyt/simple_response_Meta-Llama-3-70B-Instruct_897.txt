SUMMARY:

The debate over Medicare has intensified, with the Obama campaign accusing Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan of planning to "end Medicare as we know it" by shifting costs to beneficiaries. However, the Romney-Ryan campaign claims that their plan would be better for older Americans, as it would restore $716 billion in Medicare savings that were allegedly "raided" by President Obama's health care law to fund Obamacare. In reality, both plans assume the same amount of Medicare savings, but would use the money differently. The Obama plan would use the savings to offset the cost of covering the uninsured and improve the Medicare trust fund, while the Romney-Ryan plan would use it to shore up Medicare and reduce budget deficits. The moral framing of this debate is clear: the Obama campaign is accusing the Romney-Ryan campaign of being dishonest and hypocritical, while the Romney-Ryan campaign is accusing the Obama administration of raiding Medicare to fund a new government program.

END OF SUMMARY.
