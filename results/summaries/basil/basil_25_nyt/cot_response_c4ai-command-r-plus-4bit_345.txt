SUMMARY: 
The battle over Medicare between the Obama and Romney-Ryan campaigns rages on, with both sides accusing the other of dishonesty and hypocrisy. The Obama campaign accuses Romney and Ryan of planning to "end Medicare as we know it," while the Romney-Ryan campaign counters that Obama has "cut" Medicare to fund his health care law. The Romney-Ryan campaign promises to "restore" Medicare funding and accuses Obama of "raiding" the program to fund his signature legislation. 

At the heart of the debate is the Affordable Care Act, which aims to improve Medicare's financial condition and expand coverage to the uninsured. The law achieves savings in part by reducing projected payments to health maintenance organizations and providers. The Romney-Ryan plan, on the other hand, would limit the government's financial commitment to Medicare by providing beneficiaries with a fixed amount to purchase private insurance or cover traditional Medicare costs. 

Both approaches aim to constrain Medicare spending growth, but the moral framing of the debate centers on accusations of "devastating" cuts, "raids," and broken "guarantees." The Romney-Ryan campaign frames its approach as a necessary "tackle" of fiscal challenges, promising to "restore" Medicare to stability, while the Obama campaign defends its reforms as a moral imperative to ensure healthcare access for all Americans, especially the vulnerable elderly population dependent on Medicare.
