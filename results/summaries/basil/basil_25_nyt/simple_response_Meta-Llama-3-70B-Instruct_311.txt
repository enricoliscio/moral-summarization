SUMMARY:

The Medicare debate continues to intensify in the presidential race, with both parties accusing each other of being dishonest about their plans. Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget blueprint assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama's health care law, which Republicans have criticized as devastating to older Americans. However, the Obama campaign argues that Ryan's plan would "end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. Republicans counter that their plan would strengthen Medicare and protect it from Obama's "raid" of $716 billion to fund the Affordable Care Act. Democrats point out that Ryan's budget plan, approved by the House, includes similar savings, and that repealing the Affordable Care Act would also eliminate new Medicare benefits. The moral framing of the debate centers on who is being honest and responsible about protecting Medicare and its beneficiaries.
