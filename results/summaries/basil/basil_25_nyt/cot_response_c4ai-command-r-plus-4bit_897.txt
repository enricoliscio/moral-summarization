SUMMARY: 
The debate over Medicare and its future has become a key focus of the political race, with both parties accusing each other of "devastating" and "unfair" actions. The Obama campaign has attacked the Ryan-endorsed Romney budget plan as "ending Medicare as we know it," claiming it would shift costs to beneficiaries. The Republicans have countered with an ad accusing Obama of "raiding" Medicare to fund his own health care law. The ad has been labeled "dishonest and hypocritical" by the Obama campaign, who argue that their plan protects guaranteed benefits. 

At the heart of the debate is the Affordable Care Act, which aims to improve Medicare's financial condition and expand coverage. The Republicans, including Romney and Ryan, have vowed to repeal this law, arguing that it cuts Medicare benefits and that the savings should be used to shore up Medicare and reduce deficits instead. However, their own budget plan assumes similar savings, leading to accusations of "deflection" and "hypocrisy" from the Democrats. 

The Romney-Ryan plan proposes limiting the government's financial commitment to Medicare, offering beneficiaries a fixed amount to buy private insurance or cover traditional Medicare costs. In contrast, the Affordable Care Act reduces payments to providers and creates a cost control board to ensure savings. The Republicans have criticized this board as a tool for "rationing" healthcare. 

The battle over Medicare highlights the stark differences in approaches to healthcare between the two parties, with both sides claiming to be the true protectors and defenders of this critical program for older Americans.
