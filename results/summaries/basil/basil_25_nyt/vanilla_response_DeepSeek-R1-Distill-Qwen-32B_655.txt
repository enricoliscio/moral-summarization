Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. It's about the debate over Medicare between Obama and the Republicans, specifically Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney. 

The article mentions that Ryan's budget plan assumes the same Medicare savings as Obama's healthcare law. Both sides are accusing each other of cutting Medicare funds. Obama's campaign says Ryan's plan would end Medicare as we know it, while Republicans argue that Obama cut $716 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare.

I should note the key points: both parties are using the same savings figure, the accusations from each side about cutting Medicare, and the different approaches to achieving savings. Obama's law reduces payments to providers, while Ryan's plan changes the government's role by setting fixed contributions for beneficiaries to buy insurance or traditional Medicare.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the main arguments from both sides without getting too detailed. Also, I should include the fact that the Democrats point out Ryan's plan includes similar savings, and the Republicans argue they're using the savings to strengthen Medicare.

Putting it all together, the summary should highlight the ongoing debate, the savings figures, the accusations, and the different approaches to Medicare reform.
