SUMMARY:
The Medicare debate continues to escalate, with the Obama campaign accusing Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget plan of being "dishonest" and "hypocritical" for assuming the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama's health care law. The Romney-Ryan Medicare plan is said to "end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. The Republicans have hit back with a TV commercial claiming that Obama's health care law has "raided" Medicare of $716 billion to pay for Obamacare. However, the Obama campaign argues that the savings do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit. Ryan welcomes the debate, saying his plan is meant to "protect" and "strengthen" Medicare. The debate centers on changes made to the program in the Affordable Care Act, with both parties trying to deflect attacks and present themselves as the true defenders of Medicare. END OF SUMMARY.
