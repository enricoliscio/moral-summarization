SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare has taken center stage in the 2012 presidential election, with both parties accusing the other of jeopardizing the program for older Americans. The Obama campaign has criticized the budget plan proposed by Representative Paul Ryan and endorsed by Mitt Romney, claiming it would "end Medicare as we know it." Meanwhile, Republicans have countered with advertisements accusing Obama of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to fund his health care law. The debate centers on the Affordable Care Act's changes to Medicare, with both sides proposing similar overall constraints on spending per beneficiary. The key difference is in their approaches, with Ryan and Romney favoring a voucher-like system that limits the government's financial commitment, while Obama seeks to reduce payments to providers and create a cost control board. The fight over Medicare reflects the larger ideological divide between the parties on the role of government in healthcare.
