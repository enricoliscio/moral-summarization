SUMMARY:
The Medicare debate continues to intensify, with the Obama campaign accusing Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan of being "dishonest" and "hypocritical" in their claims about the program. The Romney-Ryan Medicare plan, endorsed by the House, assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama's health care law, which they claim would be "devastating" to millions of older Americans. However, the Obama campaign argues that these savings "do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit." The Romney campaign claims that their plan would "strengthen" and "protect" Medicare, while the Obama campaign says it would "end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. The debate centers on changes made to the program in the Affordable Care Act, with both sides accusing each other of being deceitful in their representations. END OF SUMMARY.
