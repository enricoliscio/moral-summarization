Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points. The article is about the debate over Medicare between Obama and the Romney-Ryan campaign. 

First, I see that both sides are talking about savings in Medicare. Obama's health care law includes $716 billion in savings, which Romney and Ryan claim would hurt millions of seniors. The Obama campaign says Ryan's plan would end Medicare as we know it and shift costs to beneficiaries. 

Then, the Republicans are countering with ads saying Obama cut Medicare funds for Obamacare. The Democrats argue that Ryan's budget also includes similar savings but uses them differently. The savings come from the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans want to repeal. 

The article also mentions that both Ryan and Obama aim to control Medicare spending but do so in different ways. Ryan's plan changes the government's role to fixed contributions, while Obama's law reduces payments to providers and has a cost control board. Romney wants to repeal Obama's law and restore Medicare funding.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: the debate over Medicare savings, the accusations from both sides, the methods each side uses to control spending, and the implications for the election. I'll make sure to mention that both plans have similar savings but different approaches. Also, note the political implications and the stakes involved for both parties.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the ongoing debate over Medicare between the Obama administration and the Romney-Ryan campaign. Both sides accuse each other of cutting Medicare funding, with Romney and Ryan claiming Obama's health care law would harm millions of seniors. The Obama campaign argues that Ryan's budget plan, endorsed by Romney, would shift costs to beneficiaries. Republicans counter that Obama's law cut $716 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare. Democrats point out that Ryan's plan includes similar savings but uses them to reduce deficits and strengthen Medicare. The savings stem from the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans aim to repeal, potentially eliminating new Medicare benefits. Romney vows to restore Medicare funding by repealing Obamacare. Both Ryan and Obama propose controlling Medicare spending, but through different methods: Ryan's plan shifts to fixed government contributions, while Obama's law reduces payments to providers and introduces a cost control board. The debate highlights the political stakes as both parties vie for the support of Medicare beneficiaries. END OF SUMMARY.
