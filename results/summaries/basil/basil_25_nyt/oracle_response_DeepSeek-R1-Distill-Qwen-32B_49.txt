Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It's about the debate between Obama and Romney/Ryan over Medicare savings. The author uses words like "devastating," "end," and "dishonest," so I need to include those.

I should start by identifying the main conflict: both sides claim to support Medicare but have different approaches. Romney and Ryan argue that Obama's cuts are harmful, using terms like "raid" and "squeezed." Obama's campaign counters by saying their plan doesn't cut benefits and actually improves Medicare.

Next, I'll note the specific numbers, like the $716 billion in cuts, and how each side uses this to accuse the other of harming Medicare. The article also mentions the Republican ad and the Democratic response, highlighting the moral accusations like "dishonest" and "hypocritical."

I need to include how each candidate's plan differs: Romney wants to restore funding and change the structure, while Obama's plan uses savings to cover the uninsured and improve the trust fund. The summary should reflect the ongoing debate and the stakes involved for the 50 million beneficiaries.

I'll structure the summary to first present the conflict, then each side's arguments using the moral terms, and conclude with the implications for Medicare's future. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll be concise but include all key points and the moral language.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the partisan debate over Medicare, with Democrats and Republicans accusing each other of harming the program. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan claim that President Obama’s health care law "raids" Medicare by cutting $716 billion, which they say "squeezes" funding and "ends" Medicare as we know it. Obama’s campaign counters that the savings "do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit" and instead "offset" the cost of covering the uninsured while "improving" Medicare’s financial health. Ryan’s budget plan, endorsed by Romney, aims to "save," "protect," and "strengthen" Medicare by shifting to a fixed government contribution for beneficiaries, allowing them to choose private insurance or traditional Medicare. Republicans argue this approach is "better" for older Americans, while Democrats warn it would "devastate" Medicare and "wipe out" new benefits. The debate centers on whether the cuts "raid" Medicare or "shore up" its solvency, with both sides accusing the other of being "dishonest" and "hypocritical." The future of Medicare, with 50 million beneficiaries, remains a contentious issue in the race. END OF SUMMARY.
