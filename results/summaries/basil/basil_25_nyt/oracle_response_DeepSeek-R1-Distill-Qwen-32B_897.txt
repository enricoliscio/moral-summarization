Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the debate between Obama and Romney/Ryan over Medicare savings. The key points are the $716 billion in cuts, the impact on Medicare, and the accusations of dishonesty and raiding funds.

I need to highlight the moral terms like devastating, end, shift, better, cut, pay, dishonest, hypocritical, save, protect, strengthen, offset, improve, shore, reduce, raided, solvency, repeal, wipe, restore, squeezed, repealing, ending, raid, tackling, rationing.

I'll start by outlining the conflict: Romney and Ryan claim the cuts are devastating, while Obama says their plan ends Medicare. The ad accuses Obama of cutting funds for Obamacare. The Obama campaign calls the ad dishonest. Both sides are using moral language to frame the debate.

I should mention the $716 billion, the use of savings, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and the accusations of raiding Medicare. Also, the differences in their approaches to controlling costs, like the cost control board versus fixed government contributions.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the main arguments and the moral terms used. Make sure each point is clear and the summary flows logically from one point to the next.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words and that all key moral terms are included where appropriate.

SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare savings has intensified as both parties accuse each other of harming the program. Republicans, including Mitt Romney and Paul D. Ryan, claim President Obama’s health care law cuts $716 billion from Medicare, which they describe as devastating to older Americans. Romney and Ryan argue their plan would save, protect, and strengthen Medicare by repealing Obamacare and restoring funding. However, the Obama campaign accuses their plan of ending Medicare as we know it and shifting costs to beneficiaries. Democrats counter that Romney and Ryan’s budget includes similar cuts, which they claim do not reduce guaranteed benefits but instead offset the cost of covering the uninsured and improving Medicare’s solvency. Republicans argue that Obama’s law raided Medicare to fund Obamacare, while Democrats warn that repealing the law would wipe out new Medicare benefits. The dispute centers on how to control costs: Obama’s law reduces payments to providers and creates a cost control board, while Ryan’s plan limits government contributions and abolishes the board, which Republicans call a tool for rationing care. The moral framing highlights accusations of dishonesty, hypocrisy, and raiding, with both sides vying to prove their commitment to Medicare’s future. END OF SUMMARY.
