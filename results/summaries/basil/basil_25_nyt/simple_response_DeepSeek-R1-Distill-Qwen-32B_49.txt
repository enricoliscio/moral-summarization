Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the debate over Medicare between Obama and Ryan/Romney. Let me read through it carefully.

First, the article mentions that Ryan's budget has the same Medicare savings as Obama's law, but Romney and Ryan say those cuts are devastating. The Obama campaign says Ryan's plan would end Medicare as we know it and shift costs to beneficiaries. Republicans counter with an ad saying Obama cut $716 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare. The ad implies that the money was taken from Medicare for a new program not for the elderly.

Obama's campaign says the savings don't cut any benefits, while Ryan says his plan saves Medicare. The article explains that both sides are using the same savings but for different purposes: Obama to cover the uninsured and strengthen Medicare, Ryan to reduce the deficit. The Democrats point out that Republicans previously accused them of raiding Medicare, now they're doing the same.

The savings come from the Affordable Care Act, which reduces payments to providers and has a cost control board. Ryan's plan would replace this with a fixed payment to beneficiaries for private insurance or traditional Medicare, abolishing the cost control board, which they see as rationing.

So, the moral framing is about who is responsible for Medicare's future. Obama is accused of cutting funds for his law, while Ryan is accused of changing Medicare's structure, shifting costs. The ad's message is that Obama took money from Medicare, which is a moral argument about trust and fairness. The Democrats counter that Ryan's plan is similar but presented differently.

I need to capture this back-and-forth, the accusations of cutting Medicare, and the different approaches to saving it. The summary should highlight the opposing moral viewpoints: Obama as raiding Medicare for his law, Ryan as changing the system fundamentally, and the debate over whose approach is more responsible and fair to seniors.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise. Make sure to include the key points: both sides using the same savings, the accusations of cutting benefits, the different methods (Obama's cost reductions vs. Ryan's private options), and the political stakes with 50 million beneficiaries.

Let me structure it: start with the debate, mention both sides' accusations, explain the savings and their uses, describe the methods each uses to achieve savings, and conclude with the political implications.

I think that covers the main points while preserving the moral arguments presented in the article.

SUMMARY: The article highlights a heated partisan debate over Medicare between President Obama and Republican candidates Mitt Romney and Paul D. Ryan. Romney and Ryan argue that Obama's health care law cuts $716 billion from Medicare, diverting funds to Obamacare, while Obama accuses Ryan's plan of ending Medicare as we know it by shifting costs to beneficiaries. Republicans counter that Ryan's plan strengthens Medicare, while Democrats point out that Ryan's budget assumes the same savings as Obama's law but uses them to reduce deficits instead of improving Medicare's trust fund. The debate centers on how to control Medicare spending: Obama's law reduces payments to providers and creates a cost control board, while Ryan's plan replaces the open-ended commitment with fixed payments for private insurance or traditional Medicare. The moral framing emphasizes trust in Medicare's future, with Romney and Ryan accusing Obama of raiding Medicare and Obama and Democrats accusing them of fundamentally altering the program. END OF SUMMARY.
