SUMMARY: Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan's shared Medicare plan has come under fire from the Obama campaign, which argues that their budget plan would "end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. The Romney-Ryan campaign has countered with a television ad claiming that it is Obama who has cut $716 billion from Medicare to fund his health care program, a statement the Obama campaign has called "dishonest and hypocritical." The savings, they argue, do not affect guaranteed Medicare benefits. 

The debate centers on the Affordable Care Act, which aims to improve Medicare's financial condition and offset the cost of covering the uninsured. Romney and Ryan propose using similar savings to shore up Medicare and reduce deficits. However, their plan would limit the government's open-ended financial commitment to Medicare by providing beneficiaries with a fixed amount to purchase private insurance or cover traditional Medicare costs. 

Ryan has welcomed the debate, stating that their plan will save, protect, and strengthen Medicare. The Obama campaign, meanwhile, points to the repeal of new Medicare benefits that would accompany the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. The Romney-Ryan campaign has responded by pledging to restore funding to Medicare by repealing the 2010 health law. 

The moral dilemma at play in this debate revolves around the ethical treatment of older Americans and the fulfillment of the social contract between generations. 

END OF SUMMARY.
