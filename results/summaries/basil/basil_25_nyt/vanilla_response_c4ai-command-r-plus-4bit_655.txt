SUMMARY: The battle over Medicare has taken center stage in the race for the White House, with the Obama campaign accusing Mitt Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, of planning to "end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. The Romney-Ryan campaign has countered with a TV ad claiming that it is President Obama who has cut $716 billion from Medicare to fund his health care law. The ad asserts that the Romney-Ryan plan protects Medicare and guarantees health care for older Americans. The truth is more complex. Both the Obama and Ryan budgets assume similar Medicare savings, but they achieve these savings in different ways. The Ryan plan would limit the government's financial commitment to Medicare by providing a fixed amount of money per beneficiary for private insurance or traditional coverage. The Obama health care law reduces projected payments to health providers and establishes a Medicare cost control board. While the Romney-Ryan campaign pledges to restore funding to Medicare, the specifics of their plan remain unclear. The dispute highlights the complexities of Medicare reform and the challenges faced by both parties in balancing the program's financial stability with the health needs of older Americans.
END OF SUMMARY.
