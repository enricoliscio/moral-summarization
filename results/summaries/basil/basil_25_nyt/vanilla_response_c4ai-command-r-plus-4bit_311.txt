SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare has intensified as the presidential race heats up, with the Obama campaign accusing Mitt Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, of planning to "end Medicare as we know it." Romney and Ryan have criticized President Obama for cutting $716 billion from Medicare to fund the Affordable Care Act, but their own budget plan assumes similar savings. The Ryan budget plan, endorsed by Romney, would use the savings to shore up Medicare and reduce the deficit, while Obama would use them to cover the uninsured and improve the Medicare trust fund. The debate centers on how to achieve similar constraints on Medicare spending, with Ryan and Romney favoring a voucher-like system and Obama relying on payment reductions to healthcare providers and a cost control board. The Romney-Ryan campaign has pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act and restore funding to Medicare, but the Obama campaign argues that their plan would shift costs to beneficiaries. The Medicare debate highlights the differing approaches of the two campaigns to tackle the country's fiscal challenges.
