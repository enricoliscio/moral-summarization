Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed process with two steps: first, identifying morally framed words, and then writing a summary using those words.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article to spot words that carry moral connotations. Words like "devastating," "dishonest," "hypocritical," "raid," "savings," "cuts," "guaranteed," "end," "shift," "solvent," "raided," "repeal," "restore," "fiscal," "reducing," "fixed," "rationing," "end Medicare," "siphon," "erode," "undermine," "compromise," "honest," and "principles." These words are key to the moral arguments presented by both sides.

Now, for the summary, I need to encapsulate the main points, ensuring I include these morally charged terms. The article discusses the Republican and Democratic stances on Medicare savings. Republicans argue that Obama's plan cuts Medicare funds for Obamacare, while Democrats counter that Ryan's plan would shift costs to beneficiaries. The summary should reflect this debate, highlighting the moral claims each side makes about their approach to Medicare.

I'll structure the summary to mention the $716 billion in savings, the accusations of raiding funds, the guarantee of benefits, and the methods each party proposes to save Medicare. I'll also include the opposing viewpoints on whether the savings cut benefits or not, and the broader implications for the Medicare trust fund and budget deficits.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all the identified morally framed words to maintain the original article's tone and arguments.

**SUMMARY:**
The article highlights the ongoing partisan debate over Medicare, with Republicans and Democrats accusing each other of devastating cuts and dishonest claims. Republicans argue that President Obama's health care law siphons $716 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while Democrats counter that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan's plan would end Medicare as we know it by shifting costs to beneficiaries. The debate centers on $700 billion in savings from 2013 to 2022, with Republicans claiming these funds would restore Medicare's solvency and reduce deficits, while Democrats insist the cuts do not erode guaranteed benefits. Republicans accuse Obama of raiding Medicare, while Democrats argue Romney and Ryan's plan would undermine the program by introducing fixed government contributions for private insurance or traditional Medicare. The article also discusses the Affordable Care Act's cost control board, which Republicans aim to abolish, calling it a tool for rationing care. The moral framing emphasizes principles of honesty, fiscal responsibility, and the protection of Medicare for older Americans. END OF SUMMARY.
