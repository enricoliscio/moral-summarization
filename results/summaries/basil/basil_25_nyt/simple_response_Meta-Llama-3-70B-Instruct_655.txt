SUMMARY:

The Medicare debate continues to intensify in the US presidential race. Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan, endorsed by Mitt Romney, assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama's healthcare law, despite Romney and Ryan's claims that these cuts would harm older Americans. The Obama campaign argues that Ryan's plan "would end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. However, Ryan claims that his plan would "save Medicare, protect Medicare, and strengthen Medicare." The debate centers around the $716 billion in savings from Medicare, which Obama would use to cover the uninsured and improve the Medicare trust fund, while Ryan would use to shore up Medicare and reduce budget deficits. Democrats point out that Ryan's plan includes similar savings, while Republicans argue that Obama's law "raids" Medicare to pay for his healthcare law. The moral framing of the debate is clear: which party is truly committed to protecting Medicare and its beneficiaries?
