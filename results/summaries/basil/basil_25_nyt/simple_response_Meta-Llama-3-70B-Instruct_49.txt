SUMMARY:

The Obama campaign accused Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan of "ending Medicare as we know it" by shifting costs to beneficiaries, while Ryan claimed his plan would "save Medicare, protect Medicare, and strengthen Medicare". The plan assumes the same Medicare savings as President Obama's healthcare law, which Ryan and Romney previously criticized as "devastating" to older Americans. The savings, however, do not cut guaranteed Medicare benefits, but rather redirect them to improve the Medicare trust fund and cover the uninsured. Ryan's plan would use the savings to shore up Medicare and reduce budget deficits, while Obama's plan would use them to cover the uninsured and improve Medicare's financial condition. The debate highlights the complicated history of Medicare savings and the differing approaches to healthcare reform. The Romney campaign claimed that their plan would restore funding to Medicare, while Democrats argued that repealing the Affordable Care Act would wipe out new Medicare benefits.

END OF SUMMARY.
