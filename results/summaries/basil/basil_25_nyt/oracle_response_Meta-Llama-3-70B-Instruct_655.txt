SUMMARY:

The Medicare debate continues to intensify, with both parties accusing each other of being "dishonest" and "hypocritical". Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget plan, endorsed by Mitt Romney, assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama's healthcare law, which Romney and Ryan claim would be "devastating" to millions of older Americans. However, the Obama campaign argues that Ryan's plan would "end Medicare as we know it" and "shift costs" to beneficiaries. The Republicans counter that their plan would be "better" for older Americans, as it would "save" and "protect" Medicare. The debate centers around the $716 billion in savings, which Obama would use to "offset" the cost of covering the uninsured and improve the Medicare trust fund, while Ryan would use it to "shore up" Medicare and reduce budget deficits. The Romney campaign promises to "restore" the funding to Medicare, while Democrats accuse them of trying to "wipe out" new Medicare benefits. END OF SUMMARY.
