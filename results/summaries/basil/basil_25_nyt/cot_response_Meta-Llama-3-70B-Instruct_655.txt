SUMMARY:
The Obama campaign accuses Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan of being "dishonest" and "hypocritical" in their Medicare plan, which they claim would "end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. The Republicans argue that their plan is better for older Americans, citing that Obama's health care law has "raided" $716 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare. Ryan's budget plan, endorsed by Romney, assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as Obama's law, but would use the money to "strengthen", "protect", and "save" Medicare. The Obama campaign counters that Ryan's plan would not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit. The debate centers on changes made to the program in the Affordable Care Act, with both parties accusing each other of being "dishonest" and "hypocritical". END OF SUMMARY.
