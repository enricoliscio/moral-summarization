SUMMARY: The battle over Medicare has become a central issue in the 2012 presidential election, with the Obama campaign accusing Mitt Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, of planning to "end Medicare as we know it." Romney and Ryan have criticized President Obama's healthcare law, claiming that it cuts $716 billion from Medicare, while their own budget plan assumes similar savings. The Ryan budget plan, approved by the House, aims to use the savings to improve Medicare's financial condition and reduce deficits. Democrats argue that repealing the healthcare law would also eliminate new Medicare benefits. The Romney-Ryan plan proposes to limit the government's financial commitment to Medicare by providing a fixed amount of money to beneficiaries to purchase private insurance or cover traditional Medicare. In contrast, the Affordable Care Act reduces payments to healthcare providers and creates a Medicare cost control board to ensure savings. The debate highlights the different approaches taken by the two parties to address the challenges facing the Medicare program. END OF SUMMARY.
