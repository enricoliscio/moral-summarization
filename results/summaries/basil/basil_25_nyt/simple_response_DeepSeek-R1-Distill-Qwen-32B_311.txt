Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Medicare debate between Obama and Ryan. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

The article talks about how both Obama and Ryan's budgets assume similar Medicare savings, but they're being criticized differently. The Democrats say Romney and Ryan are cutting Medicare, while the Republicans argue that Obama is raiding it for Obamacare. There's a lot of back and forth in the campaign ads, with each side accusing the other of harming Medicare.

I should highlight the key points: both candidates' budgets have similar savings, the accusations from each side, the details of how each plan would affect Medicare, and the political implications. I need to make sure the summary reflects the moral arguments each side is making without taking a side myself.

Let me structure it: start with the main issue, then the accusations from both parties, the specifics of each plan, and end with the stakes involved. Keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the ongoing debate over Medicare between President Obama and Representative Paul D. Ryan, with both sides accusing the other of harming the program. While Obama’s Affordable Care Act and Ryan’s budget plan assume similar Medicare savings, Democrats argue that Ryan’s plan would shift costs to beneficiaries, effectively ending Medicare as we know it. Republicans counter that Obama’s law has cut $716 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare. Ryan defends his plan as a way to save and strengthen Medicare, while Romney’s campaign claims they would restore Medicare funding by repealing Obamacare. The article highlights the political stakes, with both parties vying for the support of Medicare beneficiaries. The debate centers on how to achieve Medicare savings: Obama’s law reduces payments to providers, while Ryan’s plan shifts to a fixed government contribution for private insurance or traditional Medicare. The moral framing emphasizes accusations of raiding Medicare for political gain versus offering a plan to protect it. END OF SUMMARY.
