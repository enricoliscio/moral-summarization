SUMMARY:

The Medicare debate continues to escalate, with the Obama campaign accusing Rep. Paul D. Ryan's budget plan of seeking to "end Medicare as we know it" and "shift costs to beneficiaries." The plan, endorsed by Mitt Romney, assumes the same Medicare savings as President Obama's health care law, which Ryan and Romney claim would be "devastating" to older Americans. However, the Obama campaign argues that these savings "do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit." Ryan welcomes the debate, saying his plan aims to "save Medicare, protect Medicare, and strengthen Medicare." The plan would use the savings to "shore up Medicare" and reduce budget deficits. Democrats counter that Ryan's plan is "dishonest and hypocritical," as it includes similar savings to the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans previously criticized for "raiding" Medicare. The Romney campaign promises to "restore" the funding to Medicare, but Democrats argue that repealing the health care law would "wipe out" new Medicare benefits. END OF SUMMARY.
