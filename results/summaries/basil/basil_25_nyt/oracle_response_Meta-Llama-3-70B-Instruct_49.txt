SUMMARY:

The Medicare debate continues to escalate, with the Obama campaign accusing Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan of "ending Medicare as we know it" and "shifting costs to beneficiaries". Ryan's plan assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama's health care law, which he and Mitt Romney claim would be "devastating" to millions of older Americans. The Romney campaign has released a TV ad claiming that Obama's plan "cut" $716 billion from Medicare to "pay for Obamacare", while the Obama campaign calls the ad "dishonest" and "hypocritical". Ryan's plan aims to "save" and "strengthen" Medicare, while Obama's plan would use the savings to "offset" the cost of covering the uninsured and "improve" the financial condition of the Medicare trust fund. The debate centers on changes made to the program in the Affordable Care Act, with both sides accusing each other of "raiding" Medicare. END OF SUMMARY.
