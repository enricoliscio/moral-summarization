Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Medicare debate between Obama and Romney-Ryan. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by talking about how Paul Ryan's budget blueprint assumes the same Medicare savings as Obama's healthcare law. But Romney and Ryan say these cuts would be bad for millions of older Americans. The Obama campaign is attacking Ryan's plan, saying it would end Medicare as we know it and shift costs to beneficiaries. Republicans are countering with an ad claiming their plan is better for seniors, saying Obama cut $716 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare.

Lis Smith from Obama's campaign calls Romney's ad dishonest, stating the savings don't cut any benefits. Ryan says they're offering a plan to save Medicare. The article mentions that both parties are concerned about Medicare, which has 50 million beneficiaries. The fight is about changes made by the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 without Republican votes. Obama uses the savings to help cover the uninsured and improve Medicare's trust fund. Ryan uses it to shore up Medicare and reduce deficits.

Republicans gained control of the House in 2010 by arguing Democrats raided Medicare for Obamacare. Now Democrats are pointing out Ryan's plan includes similar savings. The savings are complex, and Ryan's plan assumes the same savings as Obama's law but uses them differently. Democrats say repealing the ACA would remove new Medicare benefits.

The House approved Ryan's plan, with all but 10 Republicans voting for it. Romney's campaign says he'll restore Medicare funding by repealing Obamacare. The article explains that both Ryan and Obama plan to constrain Medicare spending but in different ways. Ryan's plan would limit government contributions, letting beneficiaries buy private insurance or traditional Medicare. Obama's law reduces payments to providers and has a cost control board, which Romney and Ryan want to abolish.

So, the key points are: both candidates propose similar savings but use them differently, the debate over how to manage Medicare costs, and the political attacks from both sides. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the main arguments and the structure of each plan.

I should start by stating that both Obama and Romney-Ryan propose similar savings but use them differently. Then explain Obama's approach with the ACA, the cost control board, and Romney-Ryan's approach with fixed contributions and private insurance options. Mention the political attacks, the ad claims, and the Democrats' counterarguments. Conclude with the implications for Medicare's future.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too bogged down in details. Make sure to include the key differences in their approaches and the political dynamics.

SUMMARY: The Medicare debate between Obama and Romney-Ryan centers on similar savings proposals but differing approaches. Obama's Affordable Care Act reduces Medicare payments to providers and uses savings to cover the uninsured and improve Medicare's trust fund, with a cost control board ensuring savings.

Both sides accuse each other of undermining Medicare, with political ads highlighting these differences. The debate highlights contrasting visions for Medicare's future, emphasizing cost containment versus preserving benefits. END OF SUMMARY.
