SUMMARY:

The Medicare debate between the Obama and Romney campaigns has intensified, with both sides accusing each other of being "dishonest" and "hypocritical". The Romney-Ryan Medicare plan, which assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama's health care law, has been criticized for attempting to "end Medicare as we know it" and "shift costs" to beneficiaries. However, the Republicans claim that their plan would be "better" for older Americans, as it would "save" and "protect" Medicare. The Obama campaign argues that the Romney-Ryan plan would "cut" $716 billion from Medicare to "pay" for other programs, while the Republicans say they would use the savings to "shore up" Medicare and "reduce" budget deficits. The debate centers around changes made to the program in the Affordable Care Act, which the Republicans claim "raided" Medicare to fund other initiatives. The morally charged language used by both sides highlights the high stakes of the debate, with each side accusing the other of being willing to "devastate" millions of older Americans.
