SUMMARY:

The Obama campaign has accused Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan of hypocrisy on Medicare, as Ryan's budget plan assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama's healthcare law. The Romney-Ryan campaign has released a TV ad claiming that Obama's law has cut $716 billion from Medicare to pay for the Affordable Care Act, while Ryan's plan would use the savings to strengthen Medicare. However, Democrats point out that Ryan's budget plan, approved by the House, includes similar savings to Obama's law. The plan would limit the government's financial commitment to Medicare and shift costs to beneficiaries, whereas Obama's law would reduce payments to healthcare providers and create a cost control board to ensure savings. The debate has become a central issue in the presidential race, with both sides accusing each other of threatening Medicare.
