Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the debate over Medicare between Obama and Romney/Ryan. Both sides are accusing each other of cutting Medicare funds, but in different ways. The key points are the $716 billion cuts, the impact on beneficiaries, and the methods each side proposes to save Medicare.

I should start by introducing the conflict, using words like "devastating" and "end." Then, I'll mention the accusations from both sides, using terms like "dishonest," "hypocritical," "raid," and "restore." It's important to highlight how each plan aims to save Medicare, using words like "save," "protect," "strengthen," "shore up," and "tackle."

I'll also need to explain the differences in their approaches: Obama's using savings for expanding coverage and the trust fund, while Romney/Ryan propose a voucher system. I should include terms like "offset," "solvency," "repeal," and "rationing" to show the moral implications each side attributes to the other.

Finally, I'll wrap it up by noting that the debate is about how to manage Medicare's future, emphasizing the moral stakes involved. I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while incorporating as many of the specified words as possible.

SUMMARY:  
The debate over Medicare has intensified as both parties accuse each other of devastating cuts to the program. President Obama’s health care law and Representative Paul D. Ryan’s budget plan assume similar Medicare savings of $716 billion, but Republicans argue Obama’s plan shifts costs to beneficiaries, while Democrats claim Romney and Ryan would end Medicare as we know it. The Obama campaign calls Romney’s plan dishonest and hypocritical, insisting the savings do not cut guaranteed benefits. Ryan, however, claims his plan would save, protect, and strengthen Medicare by limiting government spending and allowing beneficiaries to choose private insurance or traditional coverage. Obama uses the savings to offset the cost of covering the uninsured and improve Medicare’s trust fund, while Ryan aims to shore up Medicare and reduce deficits. Republicans accuse Obama of raiding Medicare to fund Obamacare, while Democrats argue Romney and Ryan would repeal new benefits, wiping out coverage for drugs and preventive services. Romney vows to restore Medicare funding by repealing Obamacare. The dispute centers on how to tackle Medicare’s fiscal challenges, with Romney and Ryan opposing a Medicare cost control board they see as rationing care. The moral stakes are high, with both sides framing the debate as a fight to save or end Medicare. END OF SUMMARY.
