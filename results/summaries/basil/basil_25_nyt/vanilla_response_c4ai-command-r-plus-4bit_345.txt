SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare has become a central issue in the political race between President Obama and Mitt Romney, with both sides accusing the other of jeopardizing the program for older Americans. The Obama campaign has criticized the budget plan proposed by Representative Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, claiming it would "end Medicare as we know it." Meanwhile, Romney and Ryan have attacked Obama for cutting $716 billion from Medicare to fund his health care law, known as Obamacare. The Ryan budget plan assumes similar Medicare savings as Obamacare but allocates the funds differently, aiming to improve Medicare's financial condition and reduce deficits. The debate centers on differing approaches to achieving similar overall constraints on Medicare spending. While Ryan and Romney propose limiting the government's financial commitment by providing fixed contributions for beneficiaries to purchase private insurance or traditional Medicare, Obamacare reduces payments to healthcare providers and creates a Medicare cost control board. The Romney-Ryan campaign has pledged to repeal Obamacare and restore funding to Medicare if elected.
END OF SUMMARY.
