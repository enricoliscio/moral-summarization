SUMMARY:

The Obama campaign has accused Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan of hypocrisy over their Medicare plan, which assumes the same amount of savings as President Obama's healthcare law. The Romney-Ryan plan would use the savings to shore up Medicare and reduce budget deficits, whereas Obama's plan would use the savings to cover the uninsured and improve the Medicare trust fund. Democrats argue that Ryan's budget plan, which includes similar savings, would "end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. Republicans counter that their plan would protect and strengthen Medicare. The debate centers on changes made to the program in the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans claim "raids" Medicare to pay for the healthcare law. Both sides agree that Medicare is a major concern, with 50 million beneficiaries.

END OF SUMMARY.
