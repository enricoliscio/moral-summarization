END OF SUMMARY:
The debate over Medicare has become a focal point of the political race, with the Obama campaign accusing Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan of planning to "end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. The Romney-Ryan campaign has countered with an advertisement claiming that Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare to fund his health care law, which they say is a "raid" on the program. However, the Obama campaign refutes this, stating that the savings do not affect guaranteed Medicare benefits. The debate centers on the Affordable Care Act, which aims to improve Medicare's financial condition and cover the uninsured, and the Ryan budget plan, which aims to shore up Medicare and reduce deficits. The Ryan plan assumes similar savings to the Affordable Care Act but would use the money differently, offering a plan to "protect" and "strengthen" Medicare by limiting the government's open-ended commitment. The Romney-Ryan plan would also abolish the Medicare cost control board, calling it a tool for "rationing" healthcare. The debate highlights the "serious fiscal challenges" facing the country and the different approaches taken by the two campaigns to "tackle" them, with both sides accusing the other of being morally bankrupt.
