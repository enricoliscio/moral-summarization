Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about the ongoing debate between the Obama administration and the Romney-Ryan campaign regarding Medicare. It mentions that Ryan's budget plan assumes the same Medicare savings as Obama's health care law, which Romney and Ryan claim would be devastating. The Obama campaign accuses Ryan's plan of ending Medicare as we know it and shifting costs to beneficiaries. On the other hand, Republicans are running ads claiming their plan is better for older Americans, criticizing Obama for cutting Medicare funds to pay for Obamacare.

I should note that both sides are using the same $700 billion in savings but for different purposes. Obama uses it to cover the uninsured and improve Medicare's trust fund, while Ryan uses it to shore up Medicare and reduce deficits. The Republicans argue that Democrats raided Medicare for Obamacare, and Democrats counter that Ryan's plan is similar.

The article also explains the technical aspects, like how Ryan's plan would limit government spending per beneficiary, allowing them to choose private insurance or traditional Medicare. Obama's law reduces payments to providers and creates a cost control board, which Romney and Ryan want to abolish, calling it rationing.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the key points: the debate over Medicare savings, both sides' accusations, the purposes of the savings, the technical differences in their plans, and the implications for Medicare's future.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the main issue, then the accusations from both sides, followed by the differing approaches to Medicare funding, and conclude with the significance of the debate. Keeping it concise and accurate is crucial.

SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare savings has intensified as both parties clash over the future of the program. Representative Paul Ryan’s budget plan, endorsed by Mitt Romney, assumes the same $700 billion in Medicare savings as President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, though Romney and Ryan claim these cuts would harm millions of seniors. Obama’s campaign accuses Ryan’s plan of ending Medicare as we know it, while Republicans argue their plan is better for older Americans, criticizing Obama for using Medicare funds to finance Obamacare. The savings, intended to offset costs for the uninsured and improve Medicare’s trust fund under Obama, are used by Ryan to strengthen Medicare and reduce deficits. Democrats highlight that Ryan’s plan, like Romney’s, would limit government spending per beneficiary, allowing them to choose private insurance or traditional Medicare, while Obama’s law reduces payments to providers and creates a cost control board, which Romney and Ryan aim to abolish. The debate underscores differing approaches to Medicare’s future. END OF SUMMARY.
