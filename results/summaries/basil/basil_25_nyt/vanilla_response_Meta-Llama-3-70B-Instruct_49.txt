SUMMARY:

The Medicare debate continues to intensify in the presidential race. Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama's healthcare law, despite Romney and Ryan's claims that these cuts would harm older Americans. The Obama campaign argues that Ryan's plan "would end Medicare as we know it" and shift costs to beneficiaries. Republicans counter that their plan is better for seniors, as it would restore $716 billion in Medicare funding that was cut to pay for the Affordable Care Act. Ryan's plan would use the savings to strengthen Medicare and reduce budget deficits, while Obama's plan would use the savings to cover the uninsured and improve the Medicare trust fund. The debate centers on changes made to Medicare in the Affordable Care Act, with both parties accusing each other of harming the program.
