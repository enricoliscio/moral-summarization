SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare and its future has emerged as a key issue in the 2012 presidential election, with both parties accusing the other of jeopardizing the program for older Americans. The Obama campaign has criticized the budget plan put forward by Representative Paul D. Ryan, arguing that it would "end Medicare as we know it" and increase costs for beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the Romney-Ryan ticket has accused President Obama of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to fund his health care law, known as Obamacare. 

At the heart of the debate is the question of how to reduce the deficit and shore up Medicare's long-term financial health without shifting costs onto beneficiaries. The Ryan budget plan assumes similar savings to the Affordable Care Act, but it would use the money differently, repealing expansions in the law and redirecting funds towards deficit reduction. The Romney campaign has pledged to restore the $716 billion in Medicare funding cut by the Affordable Care Act, while also proposing reforms to limit the government's financial commitment to the program. 

The dispute highlights the starkly different visions for the future of Medicare held by the two parties, with Democrats defending the current program and Republicans advocating for market-based reforms. This debate over Medicare, a program that affects millions of Americans, promises to be a pivotal issue as the election draws near.
