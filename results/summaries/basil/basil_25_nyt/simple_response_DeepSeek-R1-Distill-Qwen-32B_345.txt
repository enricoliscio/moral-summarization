Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about the debate over Medicare between Obama and Ryan/Romney. The key points are the $716 billion in savings, how each side uses these savings, and the accusations of cutting benefits.

First, I should note that both Obama and Ryan's plans assume the same savings from Medicare. Obama uses the money for expanding coverage and the trust fund, while Ryan uses it for Medicare solvency and deficit reduction. The Republicans argue that Obama is raiding Medicare, while Democrats counter that Ryan's plan ends Medicare as we know it.

I need to highlight the moral arguments: Obama's camp accuses Republicans of cutting benefits, while Republicans claim Obama is taking money away from Medicare for his healthcare law. The article also mentions the structural changes, like Ryan's proposal for fixed contributions and Romney's plan to repeal Obamacare.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, making sure to include the main points without getting too detailed. The moral framing is about who is responsible for the cuts and the impact on seniors. I'll structure it to show the opposing viewpoints clearly.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the ongoing political debate over Medicare between President Obama and Republican candidates Mitt Romney and Paul D. Ryan. Both Obama's Affordable Care Act and Ryan's budget plan assume $716 billion in Medicare savings over a decade, but the parties frame the implications differently. Obama's plan uses the savings to expand coverage and support the Medicare trust fund, while Ryan's plan reallocates the funds to shore up Medicare and reduce the budget deficit. Republicans accuse Obama of "raiding" Medicare to fund Obamacare, while Democrats argue that Ryan's plan would end Medicare as we know it by shifting costs to beneficiaries. The debate centers on whether the savings cut guaranteed benefits or protect Medicare's solvency. Romney proposes repealing Obamacare and restoring Medicare funding, while Ryan's plan limits government spending and introduces private insurance options. The moral framing emphasizes concerns about seniors' access to care and the responsibility for Medicare's future. END OF SUMMARY.
