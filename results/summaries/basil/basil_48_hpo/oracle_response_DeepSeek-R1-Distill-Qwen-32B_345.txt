Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided specific morally charged words to include: respect, judgment, judged, hurtful, hurt, offended. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. A Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, criticized Malia and Sasha Obama on Facebook for their appearance and behavior at the turkey pardon ceremony. She told them to show more class and dress appropriately. The article mentions that the Obama daughters seemed unenthused, with Malia declining to pet a turkey. Lauten later apologized, acknowledging her judgmental tone and the hurt caused.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key moral elements. I'll start by stating Lauten's criticism, using "judgment" and "judged." Then, I'll mention the moral words like "respect" and "hurtful." I'll also include her apology, noting "hurt" and "offended." 

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to first present the criticism, then the apology, and highlight the moral aspects throughout. Making sure each sentence flows logically and covers all necessary points without being too wordy.

Let me draft it: Start with Lauten's criticism, mention the moral words used, describe the event, then her apology and reflection. Ensure each moral term is included where appropriate. Check word count to stay within limits. 

I think that covers it. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.
