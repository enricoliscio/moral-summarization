Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the article is about a Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, who made some comments on Facebook about Malia and Sasha Obama. She criticized their appearance and behavior at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. She told them to show more class and dress appropriately, and not make faces during public events. 

Then, the article explains that the First Daughters attend this annual event, and they seem unimpressed with the dad jokes. Malia even declined to pet a turkey, saying "Nah." 

After the backlash, Lauten apologized. She said she judged the girls harshly and realized her words were hurtful. She apologized to those she offended and promised to learn from the experience.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key points: who did what, the criticism, the context of the event, and the apology.

Let me structure it: Start with the staffer's criticism, mention the event, describe the daughters' behavior, and then the apology.

I should make sure it's concise and flows well. Also, keep it under 200 words.

Let me check the word count as I go. Okay, that should work.
