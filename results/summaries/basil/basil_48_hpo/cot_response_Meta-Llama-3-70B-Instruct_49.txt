SUMMARY:
A Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, sparked controversy with a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama's appearance at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. Lauten told the First Daughters to "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect," implying they lacked respect for their position. She also scolded them for making faces during the televised event. However, after "many hours of prayer" and reflection, Lauten apologized for her "judgmental" and "hurtful" words, acknowledging she would not have wanted to be judged similarly as a teenager. She pledged to "learn and grow" from the experience, demonstrating a commitment to personal growth and respect for others. END OF SUMMARY.
