SUMMARY:

A Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, sparked outrage with a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama's behavior and appearance at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. Lauten's condescending remarks told the teenage girls to "show a little class," "dress like you deserve respect," and not make faces during public events. She also took a jab at their parents, implying they were poor role models. However, after facing backlash, Lauten apologized for her hurtful words, acknowledging she had judged the girls harshly and without empathy. She reflected on her actions, prayed, and talked to her parents, ultimately recognizing the harm caused by her judgmental feelings. Lauten's apology is a lesson in the importance of kindness, empathy, and self-reflection, especially when it comes to criticizing others, particularly young people in the public eye.
