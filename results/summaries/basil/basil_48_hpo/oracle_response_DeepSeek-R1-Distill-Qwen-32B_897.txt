Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should make sure I follow them closely.

First, I'll read the article carefully. It's about a Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, who criticized Malia and Sasha Obama for their appearance at the turkey pardon ceremony. She used terms like "showing class" and "dress like you deserve respect." The article mentions that Lauten later apologized, acknowledging her judgmental tone and the hurt caused.

The user wants the summary to include as many of the morally framed words as possible: respect, judgment, judged, hurtful, hurt, offended. I need to ensure these words are included without making the summary too longâ€”no more than 200 words.

I should start by identifying the key points: Lauten's initial criticism, the specific moral terms she used, the context of the event, and her subsequent apology. I need to weave in the moral words naturally.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the staffer's criticism using "judgment" and "respect," then describe the event briefly. Next, I'll include her apology, using "judged," "hurtful," "hurt," and "offended." I should keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each moral term is included where appropriate. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200. After drafting, I'll review to make sure all the required words are present and the summary flows well.

SUMMARY: A Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, recently apologized for a Facebook post where she criticized Malia and Sasha Obama for their appearance at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. She judged the teenagers for lacking "class" and "respect," suggesting they should dress and behave more appropriately during public events. Lauten's post also criticized their parents for not respecting their roles, implying the girls were poor role models. The article highlighted the girls' apparent disdain for the ceremony, with Malia declining to pet a turkey. Lauten later acknowledged her judgmental tone, calling her words hurtful and apologizing for offending others. She emphasized learning from the experience and pledged to grow from it. END OF SUMMARY.
