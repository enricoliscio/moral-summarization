SUMMARY:
A Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, sparked controversy with a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama's behavior at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. Lauten wrote that the teenagers should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." She also scolded them for making faces during the televised event. However, after apologizing for her "judgmental" words, Lauten acknowledged that she had "hurt" and "offended" many people. She pledged to "learn and grow" from the experience, recognizing that her words had "no place in my heart." Lauten's apology came after "many hours of prayer" and reflection, demonstrating a commitment to personal growth and respect for others. END OF SUMMARY.
