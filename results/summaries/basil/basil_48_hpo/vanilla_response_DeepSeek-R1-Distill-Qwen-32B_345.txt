Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the article is about a Republican staffer who posted a critical comment on Facebook about Malia and Sasha Obama. She criticized their appearance and behavior at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. The staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, later apologized.

I should include the main points: who she is, what she said, the context of the event, and her apology. Also, mention the reaction and her regret.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Make sure to cover all key elements without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: introduce the staffer, her criticism, the event, the specifics of her comments, the daughters' actions, and her apology.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it natural. Make sure the summary flows well and is clear.

Double-checking the word count to stay within limits. Okay, I think that's a solid summary.

Lauten, communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.), urged the First Daughters to "show class" and "dress like you deserve respect," while also advising them not to make faces during public events. She later expressed regret, stating she judged the teenagers harshly and acknowledged how hurtful her words were. Lauten apologized to those she offended and pledged to learn from the experience. The ceremony, a lighthearted tradition, often highlights the Obamas' relaxed demeanor, with Malia famously declining to pet a pardoned turkey. Lauten's comments sparked criticism, leading to her public apology. END OF SUMMARY.
