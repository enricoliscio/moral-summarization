Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break it down.

First, the article is about a Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, who criticized Malia and Sasha Obama for their behavior at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. She used words like "class," "respect," and "good role model," which are morally charged. I should make sure to include these terms in the summary.

Lauten's initial post was harsh, calling the teenagers disrespectful and suggesting they didn't act like proper role models. That's a clear moral judgment. She later apologized, acknowledging her own insensitivity. So the summary should highlight both the criticism and the subsequent apology, emphasizing the moral aspects on both sides.

I also need to mention the context of the event, the turkey pardoning, and how the Obama girls seemed uninterested, which led to Lauten's criticism. Including details about their demeanor, like not wanting to pet the turkeys, shows why Lauten felt they lacked class.

Finally, the summary should conclude with Lauten's apology, showing her realization and commitment to growth. This wraps up the moral framing by showing accountability and learning from the mistake.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure all key points with moral implications are included.
