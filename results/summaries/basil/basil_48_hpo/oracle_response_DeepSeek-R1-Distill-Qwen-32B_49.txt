Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the words like respect, judgment, judged, hurtful, hurt, and offended. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

The article is about a Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, who criticized Malia and Sasha Obama for their appearance and behavior at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. She used strong language, telling them to "show a little class" and not make faces during public events. The article mentions that the girls often seem uninterested, with Malia even declining to pet a turkey.

Lauten later apologized, saying she judged the girls harshly and realized her words were hurtful. She acknowledged that she wouldn't want to be judged that way herself as a teenager and apologized to those she offended.

I need to make sure the summary includes the moral words. So, I'll start by stating that the staffer apologized for her judgmental Facebook post. I'll mention the specific criticisms about respect and public behavior. Then, I'll note how the girls acted, showing their disdain. Finally, I'll include her apology, highlighting that her words were hurtful and offensive, and her pledge to learn from the experience.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring all the key moral points are included without getting bogged down in details.
