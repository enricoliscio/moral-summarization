SUMMARY:
A Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, sparked controversy with a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama's appearance at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. She wrote that the teenagers should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect," implying they lacked respect for their position. Lauten also judged them for making faces during the event, suggesting they should "act like being in the White House matters." However, after facing backlash, Lauten apologized for her "judgmental" and "hurtful" words, acknowledging she would not have wanted to be judged similarly as a teenager. She pledged to "learn and grow" from the experience, recognizing that such feelings have "no place in my heart." Lauten's apology came after hours of prayer and reflection, demonstrating a commitment to personal growth and respect for others. END OF SUMMARY.
