Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. First, I'll read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The article is about a Republican staffer who apologized for a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama's appearance at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. 

I should identify the key elements: who was involved, what happened, and the consequences. The staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, made comments about the Obama daughters not showing class and making faces. She later apologized, acknowledging her judgmental tone and the hurt caused.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the apology, mention the criticism of the daughters, the context of the event, and the staffer's regret and apology. I should ensure clarity and include all essential details without unnecessary details.

I should also make sure the summary flows well and covers the main points: the incident, the criticism, the event, and the apology. I'll structure it to first introduce the apology, then the context of the Facebook post, the具体内容 of the criticism, the event details, and finally the apology and reflection.

I need to avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Also, the summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

Let me put it all together in a clear and concise manner, making sure each sentence adds value and doesn't exceed the word limit.
