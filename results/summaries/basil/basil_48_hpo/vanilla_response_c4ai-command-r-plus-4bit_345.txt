Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.), faced criticism for a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama's appearance and behavior at the annual White House turkey pardon ceremony. Lauten's post suggested that the First Daughters lacked class, dressed inappropriately, and showed disrespect by making faces during the event. She later apologized for her remarks, acknowledging that her words were hurtful and judgmental. Lauten expressed regret for rushing to judgment and pledged to learn and grow from the experience. The incident sparked a discussion about the appropriate boundaries of public criticism, particularly when it involves minors.
