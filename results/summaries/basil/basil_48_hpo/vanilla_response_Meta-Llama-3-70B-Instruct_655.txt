SUMMARY:

A Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, apologized for a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama's appearance at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. Lauten wrote that the teenagers should "show a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect" instead of making faces during the event. She also made a dig at their parents, saying they don't respect their positions or the nation. After backlash, Lauten apologized for her "hurtful words" and acknowledged that she would not have wanted to be judged that way as a teenager. She expressed regret for offending people and pledged to learn and grow from the experience. The Obama daughters are known for their humorous reactions to their father's jokes during the annual ceremony.

END OF SUMMARY.
