SUMMARY:

A Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, apologized for a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama's appearance at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. Lauten wrote that the two teenagers should "show a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect" instead of making faces during the event. She also made a comment about their parents, President and Mrs. Obama, not respecting their positions or the nation. After facing backlash, Lauten apologized for her judgmental words, stating that she had prayed and reflected on her actions and realized the hurt they caused. She pledged to learn and grow from the experience.
