SUMMARY:
A Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, sparked controversy with a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama's behavior at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. She wrote that the teenagers should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar." Lauten also scolded them for making faces during the televised event, implying they lacked respect for their position as First Daughters. However, after widespread backlash, Lauten apologized for her "judgmental" and "hurtful" words, acknowledging that she had rushed to judgment. She pledged to "learn and grow" from the experience, recognizing that her words had caused offense. Lauten's apology came after "many hours of prayer" and reflection, during which she realized that her words had no place in her heart. END OF SUMMARY.
