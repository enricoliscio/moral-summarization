Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the article is about a Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, who made some comments on Facebook about Malia and Sasha Obama. She criticized their appearance and behavior at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. The ceremony is a tradition, and the Obama girls have been attending it each year. Lauten's post went viral, and she later apologized.

First, I should identify the main points: who, what, when, where, why. The who is Elizabeth Lauten, the communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher. The what is her criticism of the Obama daughters on Facebook. The when is Friday, and the where is the White House ceremony. The why is her belief that they didn't show class or respect their roles.

I need to include that she told them to dress better and not make faces during public events. Also, the context that the ceremony is a silly tradition where the Obamas attend yearly, and the daughters seem unimpressed. Lauten's post was criticized, leading her to apologize, acknowledging she judged them harshly and that her words were hurtful.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by mentioning her criticism, the specifics of her comments, the context of the ceremony, and her subsequent apology.

Let me make sure to include all key points without going into too much detail. Also, I need to end with the required tokens, so I'll start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.
