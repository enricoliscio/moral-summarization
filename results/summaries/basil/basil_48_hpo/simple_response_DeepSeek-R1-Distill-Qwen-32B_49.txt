Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about a Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, who criticized Malia and Sasha Obama on Facebook for their appearance at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. She told them to show more class and dress appropriately, and not to make faces during the event. She later apologized, saying she judged them harshly and that her words were hurtful.

Now, I need to capture the moral elements. The staffer's initial criticism implies a judgment on the Obama daughters' behavior, suggesting they lacked respect for their position. Her apology shows a recognition of her own wrongdoing and a commitment to growth.

I should structure the summary to highlight the criticism, the context of the event, the nature of the comments, and the apology. It's important to note that the staffer acknowledged her mistake and took responsibility.

I'll make sure to keep it concise, under 200 words, and include all these elements clearly.
