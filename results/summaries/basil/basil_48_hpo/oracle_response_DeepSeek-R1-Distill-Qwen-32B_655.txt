Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the context. 

The article is about a Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, who made a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama for their appearance at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. She used terms like "showing class," "deserve respect," and told them not to make faces. The author of the article highlighted words like respect, judgment, judged, hurtful, hurt, and offended.

The user wants a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. I should make sure to incorporate these terms naturally into the summary without making it sound forced. Also, the summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll outline the key points: Lauten's criticism, the context of the event, her apology, and the moral aspects involved. I need to mention that she judged the Obama daughters, used disrespectful language, and then apologized, acknowledging how her words were hurtful and offensive.

I should structure the summary to flow from her initial judgment to the apology, highlighting the moral implications each step. I'll make sure to include all the specified moral terms where appropriate.

Let me start drafting: Elizabeth Lauten criticized the Obama daughters, judged their behavior, called for respect, and later apologized for being hurtful and offensive. I'll make sure each sentence includes the necessary moral framing without overcomplicating it.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together concisely, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes all the required elements.

SUMMARY: A Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, apologized for a Facebook post that criticized Malia and Sasha Obama for their appearance at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. She judged the teenagers, writing that they should "show a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect," while also telling them not to make faces during public events. Lauten later acknowledged that her words were hurtful and offensive, especially given her own experience as a teenager. She apologized, stating that her judgmental feelings had no place in her heart and pledged to learn and grow from the experience. Her initial post reflected a lack of respect for the First Family's role, but her apology emphasized a commitment to avoiding hurtful judgments in the future. END OF SUMMARY.
