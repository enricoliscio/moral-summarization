SUMMARY:

A Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, apologized for a Facebook post that criticized Malia and Sasha Obama's appearance at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. Lauten wrote that the two teenagers should "show a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect" instead of making faces during the televised event. The post sparked outrage, and Lauten later apologized for her judgmental words, saying she would never have wanted to be judged that way as a teenager. After reflecting on her words, Lauten realized their hurtfulness and pledged to learn and grow from the experience. The Obama daughters are known for their humorous reactions to the annual ceremony, which includes their father's "lame dad jokes."

END OF SUMMARY.
