SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, a Republican staffer, issued an apology for a Facebook post that criticized Malia and Sasha Obama's appearance and behavior at the annual White House turkey pardon ceremony. Lauten's original post chastised the First Daughters, suggesting they "show a little class," "dress like you deserve respect," and refrain from making faces during the event. She rushed to judgment and failed to respect the positions of the teenagers, who have been subject to public scrutiny due to their family's prominence. In her apology, Lauten acknowledged the hurtful and judgmental nature of her words, expressing regret for offending others and pledged to learn from her mistake. Lauten's comments reflected a lack of sensitivity and respect, and her apology recognized the harm caused by her public judgment of the two young women.
END OF SUMMARY.
