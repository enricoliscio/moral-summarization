Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to focus on the words like respect, judgment, judged, hurtful, hurt, and offended. Let me read the article again.

So, a Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, criticized Malia and Sasha Obama on Facebook for their behavior at the turkey pardon ceremony. She told them to show more class, dress appropriately, and not make faces. She also criticized their parents for not respecting their positions. Later, she apologized, saying she judged them harshly and realized her words were hurtful.

I need to make sure the summary includes those moral words. Maybe start by mentioning the staffer's criticism, using "judged" and "respect." Then, include her apology, mentioning "hurtful" and "offended." Keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me structure it: introduce the staffer, her criticism, the moral terms, her apology, and the reflection. Make sure it flows well and covers all points without being too wordy.
