Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the article carefully.

The article is about a Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, who criticized Malia and Sasha Obama on Facebook. She made comments about their appearance and behavior during the White House turkey pardon ceremony. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed words and then write a concise summary.

First, I'll go through the article to pick out words that carry moral judgments. Words like "criticized," "class," "respect," "deserve respect," "make faces," "disdain," "lame," "puzzling," "nonchalant," "judgment," "hurtful," "offended," "pledge," "learn," "grow." These words indicate judgments about behavior and respect.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes these words. The summary should be under 200 words, so I'll condense the main points: Lauten's criticism, the context of the event, the girls' behavior, and her apology. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to maintain the author's framing.

I should ensure the summary flows naturally and covers all key points without being too lengthy. Let me structure it step by step, starting with the criticism, then the event details, followed by the apology and reflection.

I think that's all. Time to put it together.

**STEP 1:**  
* Criticized  
* Class  
* Respect  
* Deserve respect  
* Make faces  
* Disdain  
* Lame  
* Puzzling  
* Nonchalant  
* Judgment  
* Hurtful  
* Offended  
* Pledge  
* Learn  
* Grow  

**SUMMARY:**  
A Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, apologized for a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama's appearance and behavior at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. She accused them of lacking "class" and failing to "deserve respect," while also advising them not to "make faces" during public events. Lauten later acknowledged her judgmental tone, calling it "hurtful" and pledging to "learn and grow" from the experience. The First Daughters, known for their "disdain" during the ceremony, declined to engage with the event, with Malia notably responding with a "Nah" when offered a turkey. Lauten's apology emphasized her regret for rushing to judgment and for offending others.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
