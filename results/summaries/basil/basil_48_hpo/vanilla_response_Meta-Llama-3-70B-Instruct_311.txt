SUMMARY:

A Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, apologized for a Facebook post criticizing Malia and Sasha Obama's appearance at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. Lauten, communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.), wrote that the teenagers should "try showing a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect" instead of making faces during the event. She also made a comment about their parents, President and Mrs. Obama, not respecting their positions. After facing backlash, Lauten apologized for her judgmental words, saying she would never have wanted to be judged that way as a teenager. She expressed regret for hurting and offending people and pledged to learn and grow from the experience.
