SUMMARY: 
A Republican staffer has issued an apology for a Facebook post that criticized the appearance and behavior of Malia and Sasha Obama at the annual White House turkey pardon ceremony. Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.), admonished the First Daughters to "show a little class," dress respectfully, and refrain from making faces during public events. Lauten's post, which was filled with judgment and disdain, rushed to judgment about the teens' behavior and appearance, suggesting that they lacked class and respect for the occasion. In her apology, Lauten acknowledged that her words were hurtful and offensive. She pledged to learn and grow from the experience, recognizing that her criticism was unjust and that the First Daughters deserved to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their positions. Lauten's initial rant and subsequent apology highlight the serious nature of public discourse and the importance of respecting individuals, especially teenagers, who are still learning and growing.
