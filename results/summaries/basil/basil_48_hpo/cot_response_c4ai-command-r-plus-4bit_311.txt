SUMMARY: Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.), has apologized for a Facebook post in which she criticized the appearance and behavior of Malia and Sasha Obama at the annual White House turkey pardon ceremony. In her post, Lauten chastised the First Daughters for their apparent lack of "class" and "respect," urging them to "rise to the occasion" and "act like being in the White House matters." She also took issue with their facial expressions during the event, advising them not to "make faces" at such serious public events. However, Lauten's comments were met with backlash, and she later issued an apology, acknowledging that her words were judgmental, hurtful, and offensive. She pledged to learn and grow from the experience, recognizing that her remarks were not in line with the respect and class she expected from the First Family. Lauten's original post and subsequent apology highlight the scrutiny and moral expectations faced by the children of public figures, even in lighthearted traditions like the turkey pardon ceremony. END OF SUMMARY.
