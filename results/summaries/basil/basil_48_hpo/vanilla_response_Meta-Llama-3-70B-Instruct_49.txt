SUMMARY:

A Republican staffer, Elizabeth Lauten, apologized for a Facebook post that criticized Malia and Sasha Obama's appearance at the White House turkey pardon ceremony. Lauten, the communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.), wrote that the two teenagers should "show a little class" and "dress like you deserve respect" at public events. She also criticized their facial expressions during the ceremony. The post sparked outrage, and Lauten later apologized, saying she had "rushed to judgment" and that her words were "hurtful". She pledged to "learn and grow" from the experience. The Obama daughters have traditionally attended the annual ceremony with their father, where they often display their annoyance at the president's "dad jokes". Lauten's apology came after many hours of reflection and prayer.
