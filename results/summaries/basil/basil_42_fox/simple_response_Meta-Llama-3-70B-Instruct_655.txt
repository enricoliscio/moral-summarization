SUMMARY:

A controversial bill in Arizona, which would allow businesses to deny service to individuals based on religious beliefs, has sparked a national uproar. The bill, passed by the Arizona Legislature, has been met with widespread opposition from the business community, politicians, and civil rights groups, who argue it would legalize discrimination against gays. Prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney, are urging Governor Jan Brewer to veto the bill. Brewer is deliberating on the decision, weighing the arguments from both sides. Supporters of the bill claim it is designed to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits, while opponents argue it is "toxic" legislation that would divide the state and allow discrimination. The moral framing of this issue is clear: is it acceptable to discriminate against individuals based on religious beliefs, or does this violate the principles of equality and human dignity?
