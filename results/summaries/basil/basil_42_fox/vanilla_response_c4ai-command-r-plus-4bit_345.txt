SUMMARY: Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer is facing pressure from prominent Republicans and others to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. The bill, passed by the Arizona Legislature, has caused a national uproar with many voices, including business groups, politicians, and civil rights organizations, urging the governor to veto it. The bill's proponents argue it protects business owners from discrimination lawsuits, while opponents criticize it as discriminatory and divisive. Some Republican senators who initially supported the bill are now calling for a veto, citing inaccurate information and media exaggeration as reasons for the backlash. Democrats and civil rights groups warn that the bill is toxic and will enable discrimination. The bill was pushed by a social conservative group, the Center for Arizona Policy, which claims it clarifies existing law and protects religious liberty. Gov. Brewer is expected to take her time in making a decision, carefully considering input from both sides, despite growing pressure for a veto.

END OF SUMMARY.
