SUMMARY:
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer is facing calls from prominent Republicans to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to gays based on religious beliefs. The bill has caused a national uproar, with opposition from the business community, politicians, and civil rights groups who argue that it would allow discrimination. Some Republican senators are now calling for a veto as well, citing "inaccurate" information and media blow out of proportion. Democrats call the bill "toxic" and warn that it will divide the state. The bill was pushed by a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage, arguing that it clarifies existing law and protects against activist federal courts. The group's president, Cathi Herrod, has derided opponents' "fear-mongering" and expressed disappointment that false attacks and irresponsible characterizations about the bill have intimidated and persuaded people to change their views on religious liberty. The governor is expected to spend time pondering the bill before making a decision, and political observers caution that she is not prone to acting hastily despite the growing calls for a veto.
