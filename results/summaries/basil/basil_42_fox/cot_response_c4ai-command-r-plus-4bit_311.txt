SUMMARY:
There is a growing controversy surrounding a bill passed by the Arizona Legislature that would allow businesses to deny service to gays based on religious beliefs. The bill has caused a national uproar, with prominent Republicans, business leaders, civil rights groups, and even former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney calling on Gov. Jan Brewer to veto it. The bill's opponents argue that it is discriminatory and will polarize the state, while some supporters claim that the media has blown the issue out of proportion and that it is designed to protect business owners from discrimination lawsuits. Democrats warn that the bill is toxic and will divide the state. The bill was pushed by a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage, but they claim it is necessary to protect religious liberty from activist federal courts. There is widespread speculation that Gov. Brewer will veto the bill, but she has not yet indicated her decision. The bill's opponents employ political tactics and threats of boycotts, while supporters accuse them of fear-mongering and spreading false information.
