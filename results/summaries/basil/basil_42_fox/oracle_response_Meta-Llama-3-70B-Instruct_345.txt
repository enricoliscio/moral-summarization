SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to individuals based on religious beliefs, sparking widespread criticism and accusations of discrimination. The bill, which has caused a national uproar, would permit businesses to cite religious beliefs as a defense against discrimination lawsuits. Prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have joined the chorus of opposition, calling for a veto. The business community, the state's Super Bowl Committee, and civil rights groups have also urged Brewer to reject the bill, labeling it "toxic" legislation that would divide the state and promote discrimination. Supporters of the bill claim it is designed to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from lawsuits, but critics argue that it would give businesses a license to discriminate. The governor is expected to take her time to deliberate on the bill, giving both sides a chance to make their case. END OF SUMMARY.
