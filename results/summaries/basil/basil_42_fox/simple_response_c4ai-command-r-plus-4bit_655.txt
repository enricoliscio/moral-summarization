SUMMARY: Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer faces pressure to veto a bill that would allow businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs, with critics arguing that it legalizes discrimination against gays. The bill has sparked a national uproar, with prominent Republicans, business leaders, civil rights groups, and even the state's Super Bowl Committee urging a veto. Some supporters of the bill argue that it is being misrepresented by the media and is intended to protect business owners from discrimination lawsuits, but opponents call it "toxic" and enabling of discrimination. The bill was pushed by a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage, while critics warn of the threat of boycotts and the negative impact on the state's reputation. Gov. Brewer is known for her deliberate approach, and political observers expect her to carefully consider both sides before making a decision. The bill has divided the state and sparked intense debate over religious liberty vs. discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
