SUMMARY: Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer is facing pressure from prominent Republicans to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. The bill, which passed the Arizona Legislature last week, has caused a national uproar with many groups and individuals calling for a veto, including business leaders, politicians, and civil rights activists. The bill's supporters argue that it protects business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits, while opponents criticize it as discriminatory and divisive. Some Republican senators who initially supported the bill are now calling for a veto due to "inaccurate" information and media exaggeration. Democrats argue that the bill is "toxic" and enables discrimination. Gov. Brewer is expected to take her time in deciding whether to sign or veto the bill, despite the growing pressure. Political observers note that she is deliberate and not prone to hasty decisions. The bill was pushed by a social conservative group, the Center for Arizona Policy, which claims it clarifies existing state law and protects against activist federal courts.
END OF SUMMARY.
