SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to gays based on religious beliefs. The bill, passed by the Arizona Legislature, has sparked a national uproar, with prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney, calling for a veto. The business community, the state's Super Bowl Committee, and both Republican U.S. senators have also urged Brewer to reject the bill. While some Republican senators who supported the bill now claim it was misrepresented, Democrats argue that it would enable discrimination. Brewer, known for her deliberate decision-making, has not indicated how she will act, but widespread speculation suggests she will veto the bill. The legislation has been criticized for its potential to divide the state and enable discrimination, while supporters argue it is necessary to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits.
