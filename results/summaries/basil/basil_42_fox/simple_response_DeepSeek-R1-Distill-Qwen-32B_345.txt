Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Arizona's Governor Jan Brewer and a controversial bill. They mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, I need to make sure I capture the ethical implications and the different viewpoints presented in the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about SB1062, which allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. The governor, Jan Brewer, is under pressure to veto it. There's a lot of opposition from various groups, including businesses, the Super Bowl committee, and even some Republicans. Mitt Romney and others are urging her to veto.

On the other side, supporters argue that the bill is about protecting religious freedom and that the media has exaggerated its effects. The article also mentions that Democrats and some Republicans are against it, calling it toxic and divisive.

I need to summarize this concisely, keeping it under 200 words. I should highlight the key points: the bill's content, the opposition from various groups, the pressure on Brewer, and the moral arguments from both sides. I'll make sure to include the perspectives of both supporters and opponents, emphasizing the ethical debate around religious freedom versus discrimination.

Also, I should note that Brewer is taking her time to decide, which shows the significance of the decision. The political consultants' comments about her deliberation process are important to include as well.

I need to structure the summary to flow logically: introduce the bill, mention the opposition, Brewer's stance, and the arguments from both sides. Keeping the moral framing intact means highlighting the ethical issues each side presents, like protecting religious beliefs versus preventing discrimination.

I should avoid getting too detailed on specific incidents but focus on the broader moral implications. Make sure to include that the bill has caused a national uproar and that there's widespread speculation about the veto.

Alright, I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll condense it into a clear, concise summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures all the essential moral viewpoints.
