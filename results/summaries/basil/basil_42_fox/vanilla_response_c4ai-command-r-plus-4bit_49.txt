SUMMARY: Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer is facing pressure from prominent Republicans and other groups to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. The bill, passed by the Arizona Legislature, has sparked a national uproar with many arguing that it legalizes discrimination against gays. While some supporters of the bill argue that it is intended to protect business owners from discrimination lawsuits, others, including Democrats and civil rights groups, criticize it as "toxic" legislation that enables discrimination. The bill was pushed by a social conservative group, the Center for Arizona Policy, which claims it clarifies existing state law and protects against activist federal courts. Gov. Brewer is expected to take her time in deciding whether to sign or veto the bill, despite the growing calls for a veto from various groups. Some political observers speculate that she will likely veto the bill, but she has not yet indicated her decision. The bill's proponents blame the media for misrepresenting the bill and causing an unnecessary firestorm.
END OF SUMMARY.
