Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer and a controversial bill. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about how prominent Republicans are urging Governor Brewer to veto a bill that allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. The bill, Senate Bill 1062, was passed by the Arizona Legislature last week. It permits businesses, churches, or individuals to refuse service to gays citing religious beliefs. This has caused a lot of national backlash. 

I see that various groups are opposing the bill, including the business community, the Super Bowl Committee, and even Republican senators. Mitt Romney also weighed in, urging a veto. There's speculation that Brewer might veto it, but she hasn't made a decision yet. She's known for being deliberate and not acting hastily.

On the other side, some Republican senators who supported the bill are now calling for a veto, but they think the media exaggerated the issue. They argue the bill is meant to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits. However, Democrats and others are calling the bill toxic and say it's divisive.

The bill was pushed by the Center for Arizona Policy, a social conservative group. They claim it clarifies existing law and protects against federal courts. The group's president, Cathi Herrod, dismisses opponents' fears as fear-mongering and says the tactic of threatening boycotts is working against religious liberty.

So, the key points are: the bill allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs, causing national opposition; prominent Republicans and others are urging a veto; Brewer is considering it carefully; supporters argue it's about protecting religious beliefs, while opponents see it as enabling discrimination.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll mention the bill, its purpose, the opposition, the calls for veto, Brewer's consideration, and the arguments from both sides. I should keep it concise, focusing on the main elements without getting too detailed.
