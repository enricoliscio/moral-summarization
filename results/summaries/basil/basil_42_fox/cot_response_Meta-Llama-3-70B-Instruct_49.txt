SUMMARY:
A controversial bill in Arizona has sparked a national uproar, with many calling for Governor Jan Brewer to veto the legislation. The bill would allow businesses to deny service to gays based on sincerely held religious beliefs, citing the law as a defense against discrimination claims. The business community, politicians, and civil rights groups have joined the chorus of opposition, labeling the bill "toxic" and "polarizing". Proponents argue that the bill is designed to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits, while opponents claim it would allow discrimination. The Center for Arizona Policy, a social conservative group, has been accused of "fear-mongering" and making "false" and "irresponsible" characterizations about the legislation. Governor Brewer is expected to take her time to decide on the bill, weighing the arguments from both sides. END OF SUMMARY.
