SUMMARY:
A controversial bill allowing Arizona businesses to deny service to gays based on religious beliefs has sparked a national uproar. Prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney, are urging Governor Jan Brewer to veto the legislation, citing concerns over discrimination. The bill, dubbed "toxic" by Democrats, has been met with widespread opposition from the business community, civil rights groups, and politicians from both parties. Supporters argue the bill protects business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits, while critics claim it promotes discrimination. The Center for Arizona Policy, which pushed for the bill, accuses opponents of "fear-mongering" and making "false" and "irresponsible" claims. As the governor deliberates, the debate centers on the balance between religious liberty and protection from discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
