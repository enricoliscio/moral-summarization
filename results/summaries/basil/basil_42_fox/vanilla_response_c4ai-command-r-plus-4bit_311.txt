SUMMARY: Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer is facing pressure from prominent Republicans to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. The bill has sparked a national uproar, with opposition from the business community, politicians, and civil rights groups. Some Republican senators who initially supported the bill are now calling for a veto, citing inaccurate information and media exaggeration as the reasons for the firestorm. Democrats argue that the bill is "toxic" and enables discrimination. The bill was pushed by a social conservative group, the Center for Arizona Policy, which claims it clarifies existing state law and protects against activist federal courts. Gov. Brewer is expected to spend time pondering the bill before making a decision, and political observers caution that she is deliberate and not prone to acting hastily. The outcome of the bill remains uncertain as the governor has not indicated her decision.
