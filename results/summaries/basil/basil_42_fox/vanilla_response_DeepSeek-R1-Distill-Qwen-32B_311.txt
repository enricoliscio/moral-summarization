Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer and the controversial bill. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, the article talks about prominent Republicans urging Governor Brewer to veto a bill that allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. The bill was passed by the Arizona Legislature last week. It allows businesses, churches, or individuals to use this law as a defense against discrimination claims. This has caused a lot of national opposition, including from the business community, the Super Bowl Committee, and even Republican senators. Mitt Romney also urged a veto.

Brewer is considering the bill and hasn't decided yet. She's known for taking her time with legislation. Some Republicans who supported the bill are now asking for a veto, saying the media exaggerated the issue. They argue the bill is only to protect religious business owners from lawsuits. Democrats, however, call the bill "toxic" and say it promotes discrimination. They warned Republicans it would cause problems.

The bill was pushed by a conservative group, the Center for Arizona Policy, which claims it clarifies existing law. They're dismissing opponents' fears as fear-mongering.

So, the main points are: the bill allows discrimination based on religious beliefs, opposition from various groups, Brewer's undecided stance, and the political implications.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should make sure to include all key elements without getting too detailed.
