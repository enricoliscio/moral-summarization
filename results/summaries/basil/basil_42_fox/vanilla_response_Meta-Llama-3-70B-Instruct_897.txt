SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is facing pressure from prominent Republicans, the business community, and civil rights groups to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to individuals based on religious beliefs. The bill, which has caused a national uproar, would permit businesses to cite religious beliefs as a defense against discrimination lawsuits. Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has joined the chorus of opposition, urging Brewer to veto the bill. While some Republican senators who supported the bill are now calling for a veto, citing "inaccurate" information about the measure, Democrats argue that the bill is "toxic" legislation that allows discrimination. Brewer is expected to take her time to deliberate on the bill, considering input from both sides before making a decision.

END OF SUMMARY.
