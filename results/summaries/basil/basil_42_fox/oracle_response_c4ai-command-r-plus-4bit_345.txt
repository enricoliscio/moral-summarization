SUMMARY: Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer is facing mounting pressure from prominent Republicans and other groups to veto a discriminatory bill that would allow businesses to deny service to gays based on religious beliefs. The bill, which was passed by the Arizona Legislature, has caused a national uproar and widespread speculation that Brewer will veto it. However, she has not yet indicated how she will act. The bill's opponents, including business leaders, civil rights groups, and politicians from both parties, argue that it promotes discrimination and will divide the state. They have called for a veto, citing the potential for harm to Arizona's economy and reputation. Some Republican senators who initially supported the bill are now also calling for a veto, blaming the media for misrepresenting the measure. Democrats have criticized these claims, saying the bill is inherently toxic and will enable discrimination. The bill was pushed by a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage, arguing that it protects religious liberty. However, opponents have characterized it as fearmongering and false attacks on the LGBT community. The governor is known for her deliberate approach and will likely take her time to consider the bill before making a decision.
END OF SUMMARY.
