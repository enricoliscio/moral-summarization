Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. They mentioned that I'm a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I need to focus on the ethical implications and the different viewpoints presented.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer considering vetoing a controversial bill that allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. The bill, SB1062, has sparked a lot of opposition from various groups, including business communities and even some Republicans. There's a moral debate here between religious freedom and anti-discrimination.

I need to highlight the key players and their arguments. Prominent Republicans and business leaders are urging Brewer to veto the bill, arguing it promotes discrimination. On the other hand, supporters, like the Center for Arizona Policy, claim it's about protecting religious freedoms and that the opposition is exaggerating the issue.

I should make sure the summary reflects both sides' moral stances. The supporters see it as a defense against federal overreach, while opponents view it as harmful and divisive. It's important to include Brewer's cautious approach, as she's deliberating without rushing into a decision.

I'll structure the summary to first introduce the bill and the governor's position, then outline the opposing viewpoints, and conclude with the implications of the decision. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll be concise but comprehensive.

I also need to ensure that the moral framing is preserved. This means emphasizing the ethical arguments from both sides without bias. The summary should present the controversy as a clash between religious rights and anti-discrimination principles.

Finally, I'll wrap it up by mentioning the potential consequences of the bill, like division and polarization, to highlight the stakes involved. This should give a clear and balanced overview of the situation with the necessary moral context.
