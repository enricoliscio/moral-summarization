Okay, I need to summarize this article about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer and the controversial bill. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that prominent Republicans are urging Governor Brewer to veto a bill that allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. The bill, Senate Bill 1062, was passed by the Arizona Legislature last week. It permits businesses to refuse service to gays if the owners have sincerely held religious beliefs. The bill has caused a national uproar, with opposition from the business community, the Super Bowl Committee, and even Republican senators. Mitt Romney also urged a veto.

Brewer is considering the bill and hasn't made a decision yet. There's speculation she might veto it, but she's known for deliberating before acting. Some Republicans who supported the bill are now calling for a veto, saying the media exaggerated its effects. They argue the bill is meant to protect business owners from discrimination lawsuits, not to allow discrimination.

Democrats, however, call the bill toxic and say they warned Republicans it would cause trouble. The bill was pushed by a conservative group, which claims it clarifies existing law and protects against federal courts. The group's president criticized the opposition for fear-mongering and using boycott threats.

So, the key points are: the bill allows religious-based refusal of service, opposition from various groups, Brewer's undecided stance, and the debate between protecting religious freedom and preventing discrimination.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the bill and its purpose, mention the opposition, Brewer's consideration, and the arguments from both sides. I'll keep it concise, focusing on the main elements without getting too detailed.
