SUMMARY: Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer is facing pressure from prominent Republicans and other groups to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to discriminate against gays based on religious beliefs. The bill, which was passed by the Arizona Legislature, has caused a national uproar and widespread speculation that Brewer will veto it. However, she has not yet indicated how she will act. The bill has been criticized by a chorus of opposition, including the business community, politicians from all parties, and civil rights groups, who argue that it is "toxic" and allows discrimination. On the other hand, some Republican senators who supported the bill argue that it is designed to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits and that the media has blown the issue out of proportion. The bill was pushed by a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage, while opponents warn that it will divide the state and polarize its residents. The governor is known for her deliberate approach and will likely take her time to consider the bill before making a decision.
END OF SUMMARY.
