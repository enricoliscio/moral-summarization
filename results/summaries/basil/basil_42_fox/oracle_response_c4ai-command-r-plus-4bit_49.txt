SUMMARY: Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer is facing pressure from prominent Republicans and other groups to veto a controversial bill that would allow discrimination against gays. The bill, passed by the Arizona Legislature, has caused a national uproar with many calling it "toxic" and divisive. It would allow businesses to deny service to gays if the owners have sincerely held religious beliefs. While some Republican senators argue that the bill is designed to protect business owners from discrimination lawsuits, Democrats and other opponents argue that it enables discrimination and was always destined for trouble. The bill was pushed by a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage, but has faced strong opposition from businesses, politicians, and civil rights groups. Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has joined the chorus of opposition, urging Brewer to veto the bill. Brewer is known for her deliberate approach and is not expected to act hastily despite the growing calls for a veto. The governor will likely spend time pondering the bill before making her decision.
END OF SUMMARY.
