SUMMARY:

Prominent Republicans are urging Arizona Governor Jan Brewer to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to individuals based on religious beliefs, citing discrimination concerns. The bill, which has sparked a national uproar, would permit businesses to refuse service to gays, and has been criticized for promoting division and fear-mongering. Even some Republican senators who initially supported the bill are now calling for a veto, claiming that "inaccurate" information about the measure has led to widespread opposition. Democrats, on the other hand, argue that the bill is "toxic" legislation that would enable discrimination. The Center for Arizona Policy, a social conservative group that pushed for the bill, claims it simply clarifies existing state law and is needed to protect against activist federal courts. However, opponents argue that the bill would give businesses a license to discriminate, and that its proponents are engaging in attacks and irresponsible characterizations to sway public opinion.
