SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to individuals based on religious beliefs. The bill, which has sparked national outrage, was passed by the state legislature last week. Prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have joined the chorus of opposition, along with the business community, the state's Super Bowl Committee, and civil rights groups. While some Republican senators who supported the bill are now calling for a veto, they claim that "inaccurate" information about the measure has led to the backlash. Democrats argue that the bill is "toxic‚Äù and would allow discrimination. Governor Brewer is expected to take her time to consider the bill, but widespread speculation suggests she will veto it. The bill's proponents argue it is designed to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits, while opponents claim it would lead to widespread discrimination.
