Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer and a controversial bill, SB1062. The bill allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs, which has caused a lot of national opposition.

First, I need to identify the key points. Prominent Republicans are urging Brewer to veto the bill. The bill was passed by the Arizona Legislature last week. It allows businesses to refuse service to gays citing religious beliefs. The opposition includes business groups, the Super Bowl Committee, and even Republican senators. Mitt Romney is one of the latest to call for a veto.

Brewer is considering the bill and hasn't made a decision yet. There's speculation she'll veto it, but she's known for deliberating carefully. Some Republicans who supported the bill are now calling for a veto, saying the media exaggerated the issue. Democrats oppose it, calling it toxic and dividing the state. The bill was pushed by a conservative group, which argues it's just clarifying existing laws and protecting against federal courts.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the bill, the opposition, Brewer's position, and the arguments from both sides. I should keep it concise, focusing on the main actors and their positions.

Let me structure it: introduce the bill, mention the opposition, Brewer's stance, the arguments from Republicans and Democrats, and the group behind the bill. Make sure it's clear and within the word limit.

Okay, I think that covers all the essential points without getting too detailed. Time to put it all together in a coherent summary.

SUMMARY:  
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto Senate Bill 1062, which allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. The bill, passed by the Arizona Legislature, has sparked national opposition, with business leaders, politicians, and civil rights groups urging Brewer to reject it. Prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney and Arizona's U.S. senators, have joined the call for a veto. Brewer is deliberating the decision, known for her cautious approach to legislation. Some Republican lawmakers who supported the bill now argue it was misrepresented by the media, claiming it aims to protect religious business owners from discrimination lawsuits. However, Democrats and civil rights advocates criticize the bill as discriminatory and "toxic," warning it will divide the state. The bill was pushed by the conservative Center for Arizona Policy, which claims it clarifies existing law and defends religious freedom. Opponents, including former Gov. Steve Gallardo, argue the legislation will lead to widespread division and boycotts. Brewer has not yet indicated her stance, but political observers expect her to weigh all perspectives before deciding.
