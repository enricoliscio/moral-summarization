SUMMARY:
There is widespread opposition to a controversial bill in Arizona that would allow businesses to deny service to gays based on religious beliefs. The bill has caused a national uproar, with many prominent Republicans, business leaders, politicians, and civil rights groups calling for Gov. Jan Brewer to veto it. The bill's proponents argue that it is designed to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits, while opponents denounce it as "toxic" and enabling discrimination. The governor is known for her deliberate approach and is expected to give both sides a fair hearing before making a decision. However, the political observers cautioned that she is not prone to act hastily in the face of growing opposition, including from some Republican senators who now call for a veto. The bill has been derided as "toxic" and divisive by Democrats, who warned of the consequences five weeks ago. The bill's supporters blame the media for blowing the issue out of proportion and defend it as necessary to protect religious liberty against activist federal courts. END OF SUMMARY.
