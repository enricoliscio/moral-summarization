SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is facing pressure to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to individuals based on religious beliefs. The bill, passed by the Arizona Legislature, has sparked national outrage, with prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney, calling for a veto. The business community, the state's Super Bowl Committee, and both Republican U.S. senators have also urged Brewer to reject the bill. Supporters of the bill argue it is designed to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits, while opponents claim it would allow discrimination against gays and others. Brewer is expected to take her time to consider the bill, weighing the arguments from both sides before making a decision. The outcome is uncertain, with some predicting a veto and others believing Brewer may sign the bill into law.
