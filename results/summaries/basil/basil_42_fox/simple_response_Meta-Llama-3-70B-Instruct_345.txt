SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to individuals based on religious beliefs, effectively legalizing discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. The bill, which has sparked national outrage, was passed by the Arizona Legislature and has been widely criticized by the business community, civil rights groups, and prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney. Proponents of the bill claim it is designed to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits, while opponents argue it is "toxic" legislation that promotes discrimination. The governor is expected to take her time to consider the bill, weighing the arguments from both sides before making a decision. The moral framing of this issue is clear: discrimination against any individual or group is unacceptable and goes against the principles of equality and human dignity. By vetoing this bill, Governor Brewer has the opportunity to stand up for these values and protect the rights of all Arizonans.

END OF SUMMARY.
