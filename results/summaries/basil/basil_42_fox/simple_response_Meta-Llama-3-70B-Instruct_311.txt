SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to individuals based on religious beliefs, effectively legalizing discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. The bill, which has sparked national outrage, was passed by the Arizona Legislature and has been met with widespread opposition from the business community, civil rights groups, and prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney. Proponents of the bill argue it is designed to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits, while opponents call it "toxic" legislation that promotes discrimination. As Governor Brewer deliberates on the bill, political observers caution that she is deliberate and will give both sides a thorough hearing before making a decision. The moral imperative is clear: this bill is a thinly veiled attempt to justify discrimination and undermine the rights of marginalized communities.

END OF SUMMARY.
