Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Arizona's Governor Jan Brewer and the controversial bill SB1062. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave it. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the article talks about prominent Republicans urging Brewer to veto the bill that allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. The bill passed last week, and it's causing a national uproar. The business community, the Super Bowl Committee, and even Republican senators are against it. Mitt Romney also joined in urging a veto.

Brewer is deliberating and hasn't decided yet. She's known for taking her time with legislation. Some Republicans who supported the bill are now backing a veto, saying the media exaggerated it. They argue it's only to protect religious business owners from discrimination lawsuits elsewhere. Democrats, on the other hand, call it toxic and say it's bound to cause trouble. They warned Republicans about this earlier.

The bill was pushed by the Center for Arizona Policy, a conservative group. They claim it clarifies existing law and protects against federal courts. The group's president, Cathi Herrod, criticizes the opposition for fear-mongering and using boycott threats to defeat the bill.

So, the moral framing here is about religious freedom versus discrimination. The bill is seen as protecting religious beliefs but opponents argue it allows discrimination against gays. The summary needs to capture this tension, the calls for veto, and the different perspectives from Republicans, Democrats, and the conservative group.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes these key points: the bill's content, the calls for veto, Brewer's indecision, the arguments from both sides, and the involvement of the conservative group. Also, the moral aspect is crucial, highlighting the conflict between religious freedom and discrimination.

I'll structure it by first stating the controversy, then the calls for veto, Brewer's position, the arguments from both sides, and the group's stance. Keeping it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Arizona Governor Jan Brewer faces pressure to veto Senate Bill 1062, which allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. The bill has sparked national outrage, with business leaders, civil rights groups, and even Republican senators urging Brewer to reject it. While some Republicans argue the bill is meant to protect religious business owners from discrimination lawsuits, Democrats and others call it "toxic," enabling discrimination against gays. The bill, pushed by the conservative Center for Arizona Policy, aims to clarify state law amid concerns about federal court activism. Its supporters, including group president Cathi Herrod, dismiss opposition as fear-mongering and media exaggeration. Brewer, known for deliberate decision-making, has not yet indicated her stance, but speculation leans toward a veto. The debate highlights a clash between religious freedom and anti-discrimination principles. END OF SUMMARY.
