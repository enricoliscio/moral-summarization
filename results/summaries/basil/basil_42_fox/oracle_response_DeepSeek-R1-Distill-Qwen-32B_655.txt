SUMMARY: Prominent Republicans are urging Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer to veto a controversial bill (SB1062) that allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs, sparking a national debate over discrimination and religious freedom. The bill, passed by the Arizona Legislature, permits businesses, churches, or individuals to cite sincerely held religious beliefs as a defense against discrimination claims. Opponents, including business leaders, civil rights groups, and even some Republican senators, argue the bill promotes discrimination and divides the state. Supporters, like the Center for Arizona Policy, claim it protects religious liberty and clarifies existing law, dismissing criticism as fearmongering and attacks. Gov. Brewer is weighing the bill, with speculation she may veto it, though she has not revealed her decision. The legislation has become a polarizing issue, with Democrats calling it "toxic" and Republicans divided over its implications. END OF SUMMARY.
