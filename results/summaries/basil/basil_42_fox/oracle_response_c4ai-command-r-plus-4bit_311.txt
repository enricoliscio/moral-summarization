SUMMARY: Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer is facing intense pressure from prominent Republicans and other groups to veto a discriminatory bill that would allow businesses to deny service to gays based on religious beliefs. The bill, passed by the Arizona Legislature, has caused a national uproar with many criticizing it as "toxic" legislation that promotes discrimination and divides the state. Despite some supporters arguing that the bill is designed to protect business owners' religious beliefs, opponents, including business leaders, politicians, and civil rights groups, argue that it is harmful and promotes discrimination. The bill was pushed by a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage, and its president, Cathi Herrod, has accused opponents of fearmongering and making false attacks. The governor is now deliberating on whether to sign or veto the bill, and political observers expect her to carefully consider both sides before making a decision. The bill has sparked a heated debate over religious liberty versus discrimination, with opponents warning that it will have a polarizing effect on the state.
END OF SUMMARY.
