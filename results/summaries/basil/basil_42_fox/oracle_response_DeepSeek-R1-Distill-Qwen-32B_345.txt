SUMMARY:  
Prominent Republicans are urging Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer to veto a controversial bill (SB1062) that allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs, citing concerns about discrimination and division. The bill, passed by the Arizona Legislature, permits businesses, churches, or individuals to use religious beliefs as a defense against discrimination claims. It has sparked national outrage, with critics accusing it of enabling discrimination and fearmongering. Business leaders, civil rights groups, and even Republican senators are calling for a veto, while supporters argue it protects religious freedom. Democrats and civil rights advocates argue the bill is "toxic," dividing the state and promoting discrimination. The Center for Arizona Policy, a conservative group, claims the bill clarifies existing law and protects against federal overreach, dismissing opponents' characterizations as fearmongering. Brewer, known for deliberate decision-making, is weighing the bill's implications, with speculation she may veto it. The debate highlights tensions over religious liberty, discrimination, and the potential for division in Arizona. END OF SUMMARY.
