Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer and a controversial bill, SB1062, which allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. The article mentions that prominent Republicans are calling for a veto, and there's a lot of opposition from various groups. The author uses specific morally charged words like discrimination, fearmongering, attacks, etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I should identify the key points: the bill's content, the opposition from business and political groups, Brewer's stance, the arguments from both sides, and the impact on the state. I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include the moral framing words.

I'll start by stating that prominent Republicans are urging Brewer to veto the bill. Then mention the bill's content and the backlash it caused. Include the opposition from business community, Super Bowl Committee, and senators. Highlight Mitt Romney's involvement. Then discuss Brewer's process of considering the bill, her reputation for deliberation.

Next, note the Republican senators' change in stance, their reasoning about protecting religious beliefs, and their criticism of media. Then present the Democrats' counterarguments, calling the bill toxic and discriminatory. Include the role of the Center for Arizona Policy and their stance against the opposition's tactics.

Finally, wrap up by mentioning the potential division and polarization in Arizona. Make sure to incorporate all the moral words: discrimination, give, get, bill, divide, fearmongering, attacks, characterizations.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, covering each aspect without getting too detailed. Keep it tight and ensure all key points and moral terms are included. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: Prominent Republicans are urging Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer to veto a controversial bill (SB1062) that allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs, sparking widespread opposition. The bill, passed by the Arizona Legislature, permits businesses, churches, or individuals to cite religious beliefs as a defense against discrimination claims. Critics argue it enables discrimination, while supporters claim it protects religious freedom. The business community, state Super Bowl Committee, and Republican senators, including Mitt Romney, have called for a veto, citing concerns about division and polarization. Brewer, known for deliberate decision-making, is weighing the bill's implications, giving both proponents and opponents a chance to present their arguments. Some Republican senators now oppose the bill, attributing the backlash to inaccurate media coverage. Democrats, however, call the legislation "toxic," accusing its backers of ignoring warnings about its divisive impact. The bill's proponents, including the Center for Arizona Policy, argue it clarifies existing law and protects against federal court overreach, dismissing critics' "fearmongering" and "irresponsible characterizations." The debate highlights growing tensions over religious liberty and discrimination in Arizona. END OF SUMMARY.
