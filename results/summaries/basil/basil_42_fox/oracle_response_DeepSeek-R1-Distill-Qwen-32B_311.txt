Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the specific morally framed words to include. First, I should read through the article to understand the context. It's about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer considering vetoing a controversial bill that allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. The article mentions prominent Republicans urging her to veto, national opposition, and the bill's impact.

Next, I need to identify the key points: the bill's passage, the opposition from various groups, the governor's deliberation, and the moral arguments from both sides. The user wants the summary to include the words: discrimination, give, get, bill, divide, fearmongering, attacks, characterizations.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict, the calls for veto, the potential for division, and the accusations of fearmongering and attacks. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of those moral words as possible without making it sound forced.

I'll start by stating the bill's purpose and the opposition. Then mention the governor's consideration, the growing calls for veto, and the political climate. I'll include the division caused by the bill, the fearmongering accusations, and the attacks on the legislation. Finally, I'll note the ongoing debate and the governor's likely decision-making process.

I should ensure the summary flows naturally and accurately reflects the article's content while emphasizing the moral aspects. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented, using the specified moral terms appropriately.

SUMMARY: Prominent Republicans and other groups are urging Arizona Governor Jan Brewer to veto a controversial bill allowing businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs, citing concerns about discrimination. The bill, Senate Bill 1062, has sparked national opposition, with critics arguing it could divide the state and enable discrimination. Proponents, including the Center for Arizona Policy, claim it protects religious freedom and clarifies existing law, dismissing accusations as fearmongering and attacks. Former GOP nominee Mitt Romney and Arizona's Republican senators have joined the call for a veto, while Democrats and civil rights groups label the bill "toxic." Governor Brewer, known for deliberate decision-making, is weighing the legislation, considering both sides' arguments. The debate highlights tensions over religious liberty and discrimination, with some accusing the media of exaggerating the bill's impact. END OF SUMMARY.
