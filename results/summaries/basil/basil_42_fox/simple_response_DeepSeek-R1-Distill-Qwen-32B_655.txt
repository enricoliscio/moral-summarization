Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points and the moral perspectives involved.

The article is about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer considering vetoing a controversial bill, SB1062, which allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. Prominent Republicans are urging her to veto it, including Mitt Romney. The bill has caused a national uproar, with opposition from various groups like the business community and civil rights organizations. Some Republicans who supported the bill are now calling for a veto, claiming the media exaggerated its effects. Democrats and others argue it's discriminatory and harmful.

I need to capture the moral arguments on both sides. On one side, supporters like the Center for Arizona Policy see it as protecting religious freedom. Opponents, including Democrats, view it as enabling discrimination and causing division. The governor is deliberating carefully, considering both sides.

I should structure the summary to include the key players, the bill's content, the reactions, and the moral viewpoints. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, while ensuring both perspectives are represented. I'll make sure to highlight the controversy and the potential impact on Arizona's reputation.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and balanced, reflecting the moral framing as presented in the article.
