SUMMARY: Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer is facing pressure to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to gays based on religious beliefs. The bill has caused a national uproar, with widespread opposition from the business community, politicians, and civil rights groups. The bill's proponents argue that it protects business owners from discrimination lawsuits, while opponents call it "toxic" and enabling of discrimination. The Center for Arizona Policy, a social conservative group, pushed for the bill, saying it clarifies existing state law and protects against activist federal courts. Critics, including prominent Republicans like Mitt Romney, argue that the bill is divisive and enables discrimination. Gov. Brewer is known for her deliberate approach and will likely take her time to consider the bill before making a decision. The bill has ignited a heated debate, with some calling for a veto to prevent discrimination, and others defending it as a necessary protection of religious liberty. END OF SUMMARY.
