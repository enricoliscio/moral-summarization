Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article to understand the key points and the author's perspective.

The article is about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer considering vetoing a controversial bill (SB1062) that allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. Prominent Republicans are urging her to veto it, including Mitt Romney and the state's senators. The bill has sparked national opposition, with concerns about discrimination against gays. The author presents both sides: supporters argue it's about protecting religious freedoms, while opponents see it as enabling discrimination.

I need to highlight the moral debate here. The bill is framed as a clash between religious freedom and anti-discrimination. The summary should reflect that tension, mentioning the calls for veto, the potential impact, and the different viewpoints.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the key players and their arguments. Also, note that Brewer is deliberate and hasn't decided yet, which adds to the suspense.

Let me structure the summary: start with the bill's content and the calls for veto, then mention the supporters' and opponents' arguments, and conclude with Brewer's cautious approach.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Make sure to mention the potential boycotts and the political implications, as those add to the moral framing.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent, concise manner that captures the essence and the moral debate.
