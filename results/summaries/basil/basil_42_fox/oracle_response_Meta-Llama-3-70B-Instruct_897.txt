SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is facing mounting pressure to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to individuals based on religious beliefs, effectively legalizing discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. The bill, which has sparked national outrage, would permit businesses to cite religious beliefs as a defense against discrimination lawsuits. Prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have joined the chorus of opposition, urging Brewer to veto the bill. However, some Republican senators who supported the bill are now calling for a veto, citing "inaccurate" information about the measure that has led to a firestorm of criticism. Democrats argue that the bill is "toxic" legislation that would divide the state and enable discrimination. The Center for Arizona Policy, a social conservative group that pushed for the bill, claims it simply clarifies existing state law and is needed to protect against activist federal courts. Brewer is expected to take her time to deliberate on the bill, giving both sides a chance to make their case. END OF SUMMARY.
