SUMMARY:
Prominent Republicans are urging Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer to veto a *controversial* bill that would allow businesses to deny service to gays based on religious beliefs. The bill has caused a national uproar, with a *growing chorus of opposition* from the business community, politicians, civil rights groups, and even the state's Super Bowl Committee. There is much *speculation* about whether Brewer will veto the bill, as she is known for being *deliberate* and not *prone* to act hastily. The bill has been *opposed* by some Republican senators who claim that it has been portrayed *inaccurately* by the media and that it is only meant to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits. However, Democrats call the bill *toxic* and *polarizing*, arguing that it enables discrimination. The bill was *pushed* by a *social conservative* group that *opposes* abortion and gay marriage, claiming it clarifies existing law and protects against *activist* federal courts. Despite the intense debate and *opposition*, Gov. Brewer is expected to give both the *proponents* and *opponents* of the bill their due before making a decision.
END OF SUMMARY.
