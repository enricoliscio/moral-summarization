SUMMARY: 
Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona is facing widespread calls for a veto of a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to gays based on religious beliefs. The bill has caused a national uproar, with growing opposition from the business community, politicians of all stripes, and civil rights groups. Some see the bill as a way to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits, while others argue it is "toxic" legislation that enables discrimination. The bill was pushed by a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage, and it has ignited a firestorm of debate over religious liberty and the potential for discrimination. Gov. Brewer is known for her deliberate approach to high-profile decisions, and she is expected to give both sides their due before making a decision. The outcome of this debate is yet to be determined, but the strong moral framing of the arguments on both sides is clear. END OF SUMMARY.
