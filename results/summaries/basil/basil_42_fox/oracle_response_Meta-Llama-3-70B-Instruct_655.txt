SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to gays based on religious beliefs. The bill, which has sparked a national uproar, has been criticized for promoting discrimination and dividing the state. Prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have joined the chorus of opposition, urging Brewer to veto the bill. Even some Republican senators who pushed the bill through the Legislature are now calling for a veto, citing "inaccurate" information about the measure. However, Democrats argue that the bill is "toxic" legislation that allows discrimination and have warned that it would ignite a firestorm. The bill's proponents claim it is designed to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits, but critics say it is an attempt to legalize discrimination. Brewer is expected to take her time to deliberate on the bill, giving both sides a chance to be heard. END OF SUMMARY.
