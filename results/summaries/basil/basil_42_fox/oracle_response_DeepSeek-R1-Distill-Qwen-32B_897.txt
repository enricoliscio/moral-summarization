Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the assistant should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The article is about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer considering vetoing a controversial bill. 

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. The bill, SB1062, allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs, leading to national opposition. Prominent Republicans are urging Brewer to veto it, while others argue it's about protecting religious freedom.

The user provided a list of morally framed words: discrimination, give, get, bill, divide, fearmongering, attacks, characterizations. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should start by identifying the main actors: Governor Brewer, the Republican senators, Mitt Romney, the business community, and the Center for Arizona Policy. The bill's purpose is to protect religious beliefs, but opponents see it as enabling discrimination.

I'll need to mention the opposition from various groups, the potential veto, and the arguments on both sides. Also, include the moral framing words where appropriate. For example, the bill allows discrimination, opponents are fearmongering, etc.

I have to keep the summary under 200 words, so I need to be concise. I'll structure it by introducing the situation, the bill, the opposition, the calls for veto, and the arguments from both sides, making sure to include the moral terms.

I should also note that Brewer is deliberate and hasn't decided yet, which adds to the suspense. The Democrats call the bill toxic, and the Center for Arizona Policy argues it's about religious freedom, countering the fearmongering.

Putting it all together, I'll ensure each sentence incorporates the moral framing words where they fit naturally. I'll avoid adding any new terms not listed and focus on the ones provided.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows logically, starting from the bill's passage, the opposition, the calls for veto, and the arguments, ending with the ongoing debate and Brewer's pending decision.

SUMMARY: Prominent Republicans are urging Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer to veto a controversial bill allowing businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs, citing concerns about discrimination and division. The bill, SB1062, has sparked national opposition, with business leaders, civil rights groups, and even Republican senators calling for a veto. Mitt Romney joined the chorus, urging Brewer to reject the measure. The bill's supporters argue it protects religious freedom, but critics claim it enables discrimination. Brewer is deliberating, giving both sides their due before deciding. Some Republicans blame media "fearmongering" for the backlash, while Democrats call the bill "toxic" and warn it will polarize the state. The Center for Arizona Policy, a conservative group, defends the bill as a defense against federal overreach, dismissing opponents' "false attacks" and "irresponsible characterizations." The debate highlights tensions over religious liberty versus anti-discrimination protections, with Brewer's decision looming. END OF SUMMARY.
