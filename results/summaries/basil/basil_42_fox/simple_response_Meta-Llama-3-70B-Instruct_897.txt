SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is facing mounting pressure to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to individuals based on religious beliefs, effectively legalizing discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. The bill, which has sparked national outrage, was passed by the Arizona Legislature last week. Prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney, and the business community are urging Brewer to veto the bill, citing its potential to harm the state's economy and reputation. Supporters of the bill claim it is designed to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits, but opponents argue it is a thinly veiled attempt to legalize discrimination. The bill's passage has been met with widespread criticism, with many calling it "toxic" legislation that would divide the state and perpetuate harmful discrimination. Brewer is expected to take her time in making a decision, but the moral imperative is clear: vetoing the bill is the only just and compassionate course of action.
