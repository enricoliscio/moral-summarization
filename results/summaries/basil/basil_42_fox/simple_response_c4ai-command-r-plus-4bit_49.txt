SUMMARY: Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer faces a moral dilemma over whether to veto a bill that would allow businesses to deny service to gays based on religious beliefs. The bill has caused a national uproar, with widespread opposition from businesses, politicians, and civil rights groups who argue that it promotes discrimination and is "toxic" legislation. Some Republican senators who supported the bill are now calling for a veto, citing "inaccurate" information and media exaggeration as reasons for the firestorm. Democrats refute this, stating that they warned of the bill's potential for harm and division. The bill was pushed by a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage, arguing that it clarifies existing state law and protects against activist federal courts. The governor is known for her deliberate approach and is not expected to act hastily despite the growing pressure. The debate surrounding the bill highlights the complex balance between religious freedom and discrimination, with opponents arguing that it is unacceptable to use religious beliefs to justify denying services to the gay community. The governor's decision will have significant implications for the state and the country, as it challenges the very foundation of equality and non-discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
