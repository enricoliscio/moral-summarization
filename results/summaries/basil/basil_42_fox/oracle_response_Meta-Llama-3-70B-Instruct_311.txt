SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to individuals based on religious beliefs, sparking widespread criticism and accusations of discrimination. The bill, which has caused a national uproar, would permit businesses to cite religious beliefs as a defense against discrimination lawsuits. Prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have joined the chorus of opposition, urging Brewer to veto the bill. Even some Republican senators who initially supported the bill are now calling for a veto, citing "inaccurate" information about the measure that has ignited a firestorm. Democrats argue that the bill is "toxic" legislation that would divide the state and permit discrimination. The Center for Arizona Policy, a social conservative group that pushed for the bill, claims it simply clarifies existing state law and is needed to protect against activist federal courts. However, opponents accuse the group of "fear-mongering" and making "false attacks" on the bill's opponents. Brewer is expected to take her time to deliberate on the bill, giving both sides a chance to make their case.
