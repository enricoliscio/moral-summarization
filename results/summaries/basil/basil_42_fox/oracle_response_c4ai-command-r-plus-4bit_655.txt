SUMMARY: Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer is facing pressure from prominent Republicans and other groups to veto a controversial bill that would allow discrimination against gays. The bill, passed by the Arizona Legislature, has caused a national uproar with many calling it "toxic" legislation that would give businesses the right to deny service to gays based on religious beliefs. The bill's proponents, including some Republican senators, argue that it is designed to protect business owners from discrimination lawsuits, but opponents such as Democrats and civil rights groups, call it discrimination and fearmongering. The bill was pushed by a social conservative group and its president, Cathi Herrod, has defended it against what she calls "false attacks." The governor is now pondering whether to sign or veto the bill, with widespread speculation that she will veto it. However, political observers caution that Brewer is deliberate and not prone to hasty decisions. The bill has divided the state and the country, with growing calls for a veto from businesses, politicians, and civil rights groups.
