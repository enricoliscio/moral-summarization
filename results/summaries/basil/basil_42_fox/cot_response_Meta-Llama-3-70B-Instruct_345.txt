SUMMARY:
A controversial bill in Arizona has sparked a national uproar, with many calling for Governor Jan Brewer to veto the legislation. The bill would allow businesses to deny service to gays based on sincerely held religious beliefs, sparking widespread speculation that it promotes discrimination. Prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have joined the chorus of opposition, urging Brewer to veto the bill. Supporters argue that the bill is designed to protect business owners from discrimination lawsuits, but Democrats say it's "toxic" legislation that allows discrimination. The bill's proponents claim that opponents are using "fear-mongering" tactics to defeat the bill, which they say is needed to protect religious liberty. Brewer is expected to take her time to deliberate on the bill, considering both sides before making a decision. END OF SUMMARY.
