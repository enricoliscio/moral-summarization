SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is under pressure to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to individuals based on religious beliefs, sparking widespread outrage and calls for a veto from prominent Republicans, the business community, and civil rights groups. The bill, which was passed by the Arizona Legislature, has been criticized for promoting discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. Proponents of the bill argue that it is designed to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits, while opponents claim it is "toxic" legislation that allows discrimination. The governor is expected to take her time to deliberate on the bill, considering both sides of the argument, before making a decision.
