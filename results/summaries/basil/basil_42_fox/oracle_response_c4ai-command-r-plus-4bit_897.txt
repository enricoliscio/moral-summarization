SUMMARY: Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer is facing pressure from prominent Republicans to veto a bill that would allow discrimination against gays. The bill, which has caused a national uproar and growing opposition from businesses, politicians, and civil rights groups, would allow businesses to deny service to gays if the owners have sincerely held religious beliefs. Some Republican senators are now calling for a veto, citing inaccurate information about the measure, while Democrats call the bill "toxic" and enabling discrimination. The bill was pushed by a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage, arguing that it clarifies existing state law and protects against activist federal courts. However, opponents argue that the bill is divisive and that false attacks and irresponsible characterizations have intimidated and persuaded people to change their opinions about religious liberty. The governor is expected to spend time pondering the bill before making a decision, and political observers caution that she is deliberate and not prone to acting hastily.
