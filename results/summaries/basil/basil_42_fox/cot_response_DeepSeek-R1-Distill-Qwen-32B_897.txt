Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a detailed article about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer considering a bill that allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. 

First, I'll go through the article to identify the morally framed words. I should look for words that carry strong positive or negative connotations. Words like "controversial," "deny," "discrimination," "veto," "opposition," "outrage," "blow," "toxic," "divided," "polarizing," "false," "intimidate," "characterizations," "opponents," "proponents," "protection," "defense," "oppression," "liberty," "activist," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose," "oppose,"
