SUMMARY: Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer is facing pressure to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians by refusing them service based on religious beliefs. The bill has caused a national uproar, with widespread opposition from businesses, politicians, and civil rights groups who argue that it legalizes discrimination and will divide the state. Despite some supporters' claims that the media has blown the issue out of proportion, the bill has sparked a firestorm of criticism and calls for a veto from prominent Republicans, including former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. The bill was pushed by a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage, but Democrats and other critics argue that it is "toxic" and will legalize discrimination. Gov. Brewer is known for her deliberate approach to decision-making, and she is expected to carefully consider the bill before making her decision. The outcome remains uncertain, but the intense public scrutiny and widespread ethical concerns surrounding the bill have put the state's political landscape in a difficult situation.
END OF SUMMARY.
