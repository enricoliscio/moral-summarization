SUMMARY:

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is facing pressure from prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney, to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service to individuals based on religious beliefs. The bill, which has sparked national outrage, was passed by the Arizona Legislature last week and would permit businesses to cite religious beliefs as a defense against discrimination claims. The business community, the state's Super Bowl Committee, and both Republican U.S. senators have also called for a veto. While Brewer has not indicated how she will act, political observers believe she will likely veto the bill. Supporters of the bill argue it is designed to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits, while opponents claim it allows discrimination. The governor is expected to take her time to deliberate on the bill before making a decision.
