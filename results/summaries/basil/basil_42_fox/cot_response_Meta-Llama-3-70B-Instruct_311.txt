SUMMARY:
A controversial bill in Arizona has sparked a national uproar, with many calling for Governor Jan Brewer to veto the legislation. The bill would allow businesses to deny service to gays based on sincerely held religious beliefs, citing religious liberty as a defense against discrimination lawsuits. Prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have joined the chorus of opposition, urging Brewer to veto the "toxic" legislation. Democrats argue that the bill is designed to discriminate, while supporters claim it's meant to protect business owners from lawsuits. The bill's proponents blame the media for blowing the issue out of proportion, while opponents accuse them of "fear-mongering" and making "false" and "irresponsible" claims. As Brewer deliberates, the nation waits with bated breath. END OF SUMMARY.
