Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Arizona Governor Jan Brewer and the controversial bill she's considering vetoing. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

So, the article says that prominent Republicans are urging Brewer to veto a bill that allows businesses to deny service based on religious beliefs. The bill, SB1062, was passed by the Arizona Legislature last week. It permits businesses, churches, or individuals to cite religious beliefs as a defense against discrimination claims. This has caused a national uproar, with various groups, including the business community, the Super Bowl Committee, and even Republican senators, opposing it. Mitt Romney also weighed in, urging a veto.

Brewer is considering her decision and hasn't made up her mind yet. Political observers note that she's deliberate and won't act hastily. Some Republicans who supported the bill now want a veto, blaming media for overblowing the issue. They argue the bill is only meant to protect religious business owners from lawsuits, not to allow discrimination. Democrats, however, call the bill "toxic" and say it's dividing the state. The bill was pushed by a conservative group, which claims it's about clarifying existing law and protecting against federal courts. They dismiss opposition as fear-mongering.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the main points: the bill's content, opposition from various groups, Brewer's stance, and the arguments from both sides.

Let me structure it: Start with the bill's passage and its purpose. Then mention the opposition from business, politicians, and civil rights groups. Highlight Mitt Romney's involvement. Note Brewer's deliberation and the speculation about her veto. Then outline the arguments: Republicans say it's about protecting religious beliefs, Democrats and others see it as enabling discrimination. Finally, mention the conservative group's perspective.

I should keep it concise, making sure each key point is included without going into too much detail. Also, ensure the summary flows logically from one point to the next.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary that's under 200 words. I'll start with the bill's passage, then the opposition, Brewer's consideration, the arguments, and the group's stance. Make sure to use clear and concise language.
