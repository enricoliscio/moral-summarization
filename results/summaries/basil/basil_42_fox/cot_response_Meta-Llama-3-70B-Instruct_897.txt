SUMMARY:
A controversial bill allowing businesses to deny service to gays based on religious beliefs has sparked a national uproar. Prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney, are urging Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer to veto the bill, citing concerns about discrimination. The legislation has been deemed "toxic" by Democrats, who warn it will lead to polarizing consequences. Supporters argue the bill protects business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits, but critics claim it promotes fear-mongering and irresponsible characterizations. As the chorus of opposition grows, Brewer is expected to take her time to deliberate, giving both sides a thorough hearing. The fate of the bill remains uncertain, with many calling for a veto to prevent what they see as a threat to religious liberty. END OF SUMMARY.
