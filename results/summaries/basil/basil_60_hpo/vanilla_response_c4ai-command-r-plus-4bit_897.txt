SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has stated that Mexico will not pay for a wall along the U.S. border, as proposed by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Fox, who was interviewed by Fusion's Jorge Ramos, called Trump's idea "crazy" and said that he himself would not fund it. He also expressed disbelief that Trump had garnered support from Hispanics in the Nevada caucus, referring to Trump as a "false prophet". This sentiment was echoed by another former Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, who dismissed the idea of a wall as "stupid" and "useless". Trump has made controversial statements about Latinos, including derogatory remarks about Mexican immigrants, and has insisted that Mexico will be coerced into paying for the wall if he is elected. However, Fox remains unconcerned about the possibility of a Trump presidency, stating that democracy will not allow for the election of someone so out of touch with the current global landscape.

END OF SUMMARY.
