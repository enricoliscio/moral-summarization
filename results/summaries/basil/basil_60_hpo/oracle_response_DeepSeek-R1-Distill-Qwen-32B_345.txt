Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include the morally framed words: calling, coerce, wall, useless, and closing. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses Former Mexican President Vicente Fox's response to Donald Trump's proposal of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, which Trump wants Mexico to pay for. Fox and another former president, Felipe Calderon, both oppose this idea, calling it useless and refusing to pay. Trump has made derogatory comments about Latinos, which adds to the moral framing. Fox also dismisses the idea that Trump could win the presidency, referring to his supporters as followers of a "false prophet."

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes the specified moral words. I'll structure the summary to mention Trump's "calling" Mexicans as criminals and rapists, his intention to "coerce" Mexico into paying, the "wall" as a "useless" idea, and "closing" borders. I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and maintain the critical tone towards Trump's proposals.

I'll start by introducing Trump's wall idea and Fox's refusal to pay. Then, include Fox's dismissal of Trump winning, followed by Calderon's comments on the wall's uselessness and the impact of closed borders. Finally, I'll tie in Trump's derogatory remarks and Fox's view of his supporters as followers of a false prophet.

I need to ensure that each of the moral words is naturally integrated without forcing them. Also, the summary should flow logically, highlighting the opposition from both former presidents and the moral implications of Trump's statements and policies.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all key points and the specified words. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that the moral framing is preserved throughout.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has rejected Donald Trump's proposal for Mexico to pay for a wall along the U.S. border, calling it a "fucking wall" and refusing to fund it. Fox dismissed Trump's idea, stating, "Iâ€™m not going to pay for that," and criticized Trump for his derogatory comments about Latinos, including calling Mexican immigrants "criminals" and "rapists." Trump has vowed to "coerce" Mexico into paying for the wall if elected, but Fox believes Trump lacks the capacity to win the presidency, describing him as a "false prophet." Another former Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, also dismissed the wall as "useless," arguing that "closing" borders would not bring prosperity to the U.S. and would harm trade and migration. Both leaders emphasize the futility of Trump's wall and his flawed understanding of global dynamics. END OF SUMMARY.
