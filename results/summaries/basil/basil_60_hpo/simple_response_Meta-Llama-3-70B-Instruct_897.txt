SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has categorically rejected Donald Trump's demand that Mexico pay for a wall along the U.S. border. Fox called Trump's idea "stupid" and refused to fund it, saying Trump should pay for it himself. Fox's stance is rooted in his commitment to democracy and his belief that a president should be knowledgeable about the world. He expressed skepticism about Trump's chances of winning the presidency, implying that democracy cannot elect someone who is "crazy" and out of touch with reality. Fox's sentiments were echoed by another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, who also dismissed Trump's idea as "stupid" and "completely useless." Both leaders' strong moral stance against Trump's divisive and xenophobic rhetoric is a testament to their commitment to dignity, respect, and cooperation between nations.
