SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has rejected Donald Trump's claim that Mexico will pay for a wall along the US border. In an interview, Fox stated that he's not willing to fund Trump's idea, saying "I'm not going to pay for that fucking wall" and suggesting that Trump should pay for it himself. Fox also expressed doubt that Trump will win the presidency, saying that "democracy cannot pick crazy people" who are out of touch with reality. This sentiment is shared by another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, who earlier this month dismissed Trump's idea as "stupid" and "completely useless". Trump has estimated the cost of the wall to be around $8 billion and has made several controversial comments about Latinos. Fox's comments come as Trump has been performing well in the Republican primaries, including winning among Hispanics in the Nevada caucus.
