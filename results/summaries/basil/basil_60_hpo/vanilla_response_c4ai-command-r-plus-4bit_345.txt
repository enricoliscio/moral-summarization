SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has stated that Mexico will not pay for a wall along the U.S. border, contrary to claims made by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. Fox, a taxpayer himself, refuses to fund Trump's proposal, suggesting that Trump should pay for it with his own money. Trump has made controversial statements about Latinos, including derogatory remarks about Mexican immigrants, and has vowed to force Mexico to finance the wall's construction, estimated at $8 billion. Fox doubts Trump's ability to win the presidency, believing that democracy will not support someone with such extreme views. Fox also questions the Hispanic supporters of Trump, referring to them as "followers of a false prophet." Felipe Calderon, another former Mexican president, has also dismissed the idea of Mexico paying for the wall, calling it "stupid" and "useless." He criticizes Trump's isolationist policies, stating that closing borders will not bring prosperity to the United States.
