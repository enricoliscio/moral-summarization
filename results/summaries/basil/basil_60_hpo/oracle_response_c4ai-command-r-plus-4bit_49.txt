SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly asserted that Mexico will not pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, refuting claims made by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. Fox, a taxpayer himself, refuses to fund Trump's controversial proposal, stating that Trump should use his own wealth to cover the estimated $8 billion cost. Fox expresses disbelief that Trump will win the presidency, stating that democracy will not support someone who makes outrageous and offensive comments about Latinos and promotes policies of coercion and isolation. Fox and another former Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, dismiss Trump's wall idea as a useless and costly endeavor that will not bring prosperity to the United States but instead isolate it from the world. They stand firm in their position that Mexico will not contribute financially to such a project.
END OF SUMMARY.
