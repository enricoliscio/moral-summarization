Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided specific morally charged words: calling, coerce, wall, useless, closing. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox is rejecting Trump's border wall idea, saying Mexico won't pay. He uses strong language, calling it a "fucking wall" and refers to Trump as a "false prophet." He also dismisses the idea as crazy and ineffective. Another president, Felipe Calderon, agrees, calling the wall "useless" and criticizes Trump's approach as "completely crazy."

I need to condense this into a concise summary. I'll start by mentioning Fox's refusal to pay for the wall, using the word "coerce" since Trump wants to make Mexico pay. I'll include Fox's strong language and the term "false prophet." Then, I'll add Calderon's comments, using "useless" and "closing" to describe Trump's approach. I'll also note that Fox thinks Trump won't win because of his "crazy" ideas.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be brief but make sure all key points are covered, including the moral framing words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point flows logically and the moral terms are included naturally.
