Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Vicente Fox and Donald Trump's wall. Let me read through the article first.

The article starts by mentioning that Vicente Fox, the former Mexican President, says Mexico won't pay for Trump's border wall. He told Fusion's Jorge Ramos that he won't fund it and that Trump should pay since he's wealthy. Fox also dismisses Trump's chances of winning, saying democracy won't pick a crazy person. There's a mention that Trump might have won among Hispanics in Nevada, but Fox questions that, calling them followers of a false prophet. Another former Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, also opposes the wall, calling it useless and saying Mexico won't pay anything.

So, the key points are:
- Fox says Mexico won't pay for the wall.
- He criticizes Trump for the idea and his wealth.
- Fox doubts Trump can win the presidency.
- He questions the Hispanic support for Trump.
- Calderon also opposes the wall, calling it a bad idea.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Fox's refusal to pay, mention Trump's claims, Fox's criticism, his dismissal of Trump's chances, the doubt about Hispanic support, and Calderon's opposition.

I should make sure it's clear, concise, and covers all main points without being too wordy. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each sentence adds a new piece of information without repeating.
