SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has stated that Mexico will not pay for a wall along the U.S. border, contrary to the claims made by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. Fox, a taxpayer himself, refuses to fund Trump's proposal, suggesting that Trump should pay for it instead. Trump has made controversial statements about Latinos, including derogatory remarks about Mexican immigrants, and has proposed building a wall to keep undocumented migrants out of the U.S., estimating the cost at $8 billion. Fox doubts Trump's chances of winning the presidency, believing that democracy will not support someone with such extreme views. Fox also questions the Hispanic supporters of Trump, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, has also dismissed the idea, calling the wall "completely useless." Calderon believes that Trump's isolationist policies will not bring prosperity to the United States and that his ideas are "completely crazy."
END OF SUMMARY.
