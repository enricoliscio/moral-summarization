Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Vicente Fox's comments on Trump's wall. They also mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, I need to make sure I capture the essence of the article without adding my own bias.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Fox is the former Mexican president and he's saying Mexico won't pay for the wall. He uses strong language, calling it a "fucking wall" and refers to Trump as having money. Also, Fox dismisses Trump's chances of winning, saying democracy wouldn't choose someone so out of touch.

I should note that the author includes context about Trump's past comments on Latinos, which sets a negative tone towards Trump. Fox's dismissal of Trump's supporters as followers of a "false prophet" adds a moral judgment against Trump. Calderon's quote about the wall being useless and Trump being crazy reinforces the negative framing.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Fox's refusal to pay for the wall. Then mention Trump's claims and Fox's skepticism about Trump winning. Include the reference to Trump's comments on Latinos to highlight the moral angle. Add Calderon's quote to show another Mexican leader's stance. Make sure the summary flows well and captures the critical perspective towards Trump.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick strictly to the author's framing. Also, ensure that the summary is concise and hits all the main points without being too wordy. Let me structure it: Fox's refusal, Trump's claims, Fox's dismissal of Trump's presidency chances, mention of Trump's past comments, Calderon's dismissal, and the overall moral critique.

I think that covers everything. Now, I'll put it all together in a clear and concise manner, making sure it's under 200 words and ends with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has firmly rejected Donald Trump's proposal for Mexico to pay for a border wall, calling it "stupid" and refusing to fund it. Fox criticized Trump, stating, "Iâ€™m not going to pay for that fucking wall," and dismissed Trump's chances of becoming president, labeling him "crazy." Trump, who has made controversial remarks about Latinos, insists Mexico will finance the $8 billion wall to stop undocumented immigration. Fox also criticized Trump's supporters among Hispanics, calling them followers of a "false prophet." Former Mexican President Felipe Calderon echoed Fox's dismissal, asserting that Mexico would not pay for the wall and that it would be "completely useless." Both leaders condemned Trump's rhetoric, framing it as harmful and disconnected from reality. END OF SUMMARY.
