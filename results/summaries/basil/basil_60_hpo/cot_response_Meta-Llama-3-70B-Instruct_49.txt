SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has dismissed Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying Mexico will not pay for it. Fox called Trump's idea "crazy" and said he's not willing to fund it as a taxpayer. Fox also criticized Trump's past comments about Latinos, calling them "outrageous". Trump has claimed that Mexico will be forced to pay for the wall, estimated to cost around $8 billion, if he's elected. However, Fox and another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, have both rejected the idea, with Calderon calling it "stupid" and "completely useless". Fox also questioned the legitimacy of Trump's support among Hispanics, calling them "followers of a false prophet". Both former presidents expressed confidence that Trump will not win the presidency, with Fox saying "democracy cannot pick crazy people".
END OF SUMMARY.
