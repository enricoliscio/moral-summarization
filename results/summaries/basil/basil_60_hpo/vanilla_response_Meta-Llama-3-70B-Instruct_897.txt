SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has rejected Donald Trump's claim that Mexico will pay for a wall along the US border. In an interview, Fox stated that he, as a taxpayer, is not willing to fund Trump's idea, saying "I'm not going to pay for that fucking wall." Fox believes Trump should pay for it himself, citing his wealth. Trump has estimated the cost of the wall to be around $8 billion. Fox is not concerned about Trump winning the presidency, saying "Democracy cannot pick crazy people that doesn't know what's going on in the world today." Another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, has also dismissed Trump's idea, calling it "stupid" and "completely useless." Both former presidents are adamant that Mexico will not pay for the wall.
