SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox vehemently rejects the idea of Mexico paying for a wall along the U.S. border, as proposed by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. Fox, a taxpayer himself, refuses to fund such a project, calling it a "stupid" and "completely crazy" idea. He asserts that Trump, as the proponent of the wall, should bear the cost himself. Fox expresses disbelief that Trump could win the presidency, suggesting that democracy will not allow a candidate with such outrageous and offensive views towards Latinos to succeed. He questions the Hispanic supporters of Trump, referring to them as followers of a "false prophet." Felipe Calderon, another former Mexican president, echoes Fox's sentiments, calling the wall "useless" and Trump's belief in its potential to bring prosperity to the U.S. "completely crazy." Trump's persistent claims that Mexico will be coerced into funding the wall are met with strong opposition and dismissal by both former Mexican leaders. END OF SUMMARY.
