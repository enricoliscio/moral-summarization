* crazy
* false prophet
* stupid

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly rejected the idea of Mexico paying for a wall along the US-Mexico border, as proposed by then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Fox, a taxpayer himself, refuses to fund such a project and believes that Trump, as a wealthy individual, should be the one to cover the estimated $8 billion cost. Fox dismisses Trump's claims of making Mexico pay for the wall as outrageous and unrealistic. He asserts that democracy will not allow a "crazy" person like Trump, who lacks an understanding of global affairs, to become president. Fox and Felipe Calderon, another former Mexican president, denounce Trump's proposal as "stupid" and assert that it will be "completely useless." Fox questions the Hispanic supporters of Trump, referring to them as followers of a "false prophet." The article highlights the strong opposition from Mexico's former leaders to Trump's controversial plan, which they view as offensive and impractical.
