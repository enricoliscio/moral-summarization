SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has rejected Donald Trump's demand that Mexico pay for a wall along the U.S. border, calling it a "fucking wall" and refusing to fund Trump's "big idea". Fox believes Trump should pay for it himself, citing his wealth. Trump has made numerous offensive comments about Latinos, including calling them "criminals" and "rapists", and has insisted that Mexico will be coerced into paying for the wall if he's elected. Fox is not worried about Trump's chances of winning, saying "democracy cannot pick crazy people". He also dismissed the idea that Trump won among Hispanics in the Nevada caucus, calling them "followers of a false prophet". Another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, has also dismissed Trump's idea, calling the wall "stupid" and "useless", and saying that closing borders will not bring prosperity to the United States.

END OF SUMMARY.
