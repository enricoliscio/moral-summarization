SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has rejected Donald Trump's claim that Mexico will pay for a wall along the US border. In an interview, Fox stated that he's not willing to fund Trump's idea, saying "I'm not going to pay for that fucking wall" and suggesting that Trump should pay for it himself. Fox also expressed doubt that Trump will win the presidency, saying "Democracy cannot pick crazy people that doesn't know what's going on in the world today." Another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, has also dismissed Trump's idea, calling it "stupid" and "completely useless." Both Fox and Calderon believe that Mexico will not pay for the wall, which Trump estimates will cost around $8 billion.

END OF SUMMARY.
