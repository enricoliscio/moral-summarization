Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about former Mexican President Vicente Fox's response to Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Fox is against Mexico paying for it and explicitly states he won't fund it. He even uses strong language, calling the wall a bad idea. 

Also, Fox doesn't think Trump will win the presidency, believing democracy won't choose someone as extreme as Trump. There's a mention that Trump might have won among some Hispanics in Nevada, but Fox dismisses them as followers of a "false prophet."

Another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, also opposes the wall, calling it useless and saying Mexico won't pay anything. He adds that Trump's idea is crazy and won't bring prosperity.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Fox's refusal to pay for the wall. Then mention his dismissal of Trump winning. Include Calderon's comments as well. Keep it concise, focusing on key points: Fox's refusal, Trump's plan, both former presidents' criticism, and their views on Trump's chances.

I should structure it clearly, maybe in two paragraphs: one for Fox's comments and another for Calderon's. Make sure it's under 200 words and flows well.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has dismissed Donald Trump's proposal for Mexico to pay for a U.S.-border wall, stating, "I’m not going to pay for that fucking wall." Fox, a taxpayer, believes Trump should fund his own "big idea," adding that democracy won't elect someone as extreme as Trump. Despite claims Trump may have won among some Hispanics in Nevada, Fox dismisses these supporters as followers of a "false prophet." Another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, also opposes the wall, calling it "stupid" and "completely useless," and强调墨西哥不会支付一分钱。Both leaders criticize Trump's border policy as unrealistic and counterproductive to U.S. prosperity.
