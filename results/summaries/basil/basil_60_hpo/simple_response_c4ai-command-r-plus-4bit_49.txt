SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly objected to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, stating that Mexico will not pay for such a wall. Fox, who is also a taxpayer, refuses to fund Trump's idea, suggesting that Trump should use his own money instead. He expresses disbelief that Trump could win the presidency, stating that democracy will not allow someone with such misguided and ignorant views to be elected. Fox and another former Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, have dismissed the idea as ridiculous and a waste of money, with Calderon calling it a "stupid wall." They argue that closing borders will not bring prosperity but instead will be detrimental to the United States. Fox also questions the Hispanic supporters of Trump, labeling them as followers of a "false prophet." This article highlights the ethical dilemma between upholding national security and respecting the rights and needs of immigrants, with Trump's proposal being seen as an extreme and unethical solution.
