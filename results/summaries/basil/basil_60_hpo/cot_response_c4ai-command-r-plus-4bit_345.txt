STEP 1:
* Crazy
* Stupid
* False
* Useless

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly rejects the idea of Mexico paying for a wall along the U.S. border, dismissing it as a "stupid" and "useless" proposal. He refuses to fund such a project, stating that Donald Trump, the GOP presidential hopeful, should pay for his "crazy" idea himself. Fox condemns Trump's offensive remarks about Latinos and doubts his ability to win the presidency, believing that democracy will not allow a "crazy" person who is out of touch with the world to succeed. This sentiment is echoed by another former Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, who joins Fox in denouncing Trump's plan as a waste of money that will not bring prosperity to the United States. Despite Trump's insistence that Mexico will bear the cost of the wall, estimated at $8 billion, both Fox and Calderon stand firm in their refusal to pay, calling it a "false" promise. END OF SUMMARY.
