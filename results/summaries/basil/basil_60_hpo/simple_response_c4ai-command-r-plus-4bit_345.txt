SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly condemned Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, stating that Mexico will not pay for such a wall. Fox, a taxpayer himself, refuses to fund Trump's "big idea," calling it a waste of money. He believes that Trump's insistence on coercing Mexico to pay for the wall is outrageous and offensive. Fox also questions the sanity of Trump's ideas and believes that democracy will not allow a "crazy person" like Trump to be elected. Fox is not alone in his opposition; Felipe Calderon, another former Mexican president, has also dismissed the idea as "stupid" and "useless." They argue that closing borders will not bring prosperity but instead, will only foster division and hatred. This article highlights the moral stance of the Mexican leaders against Trump's divisive and discriminatory policies, showcasing their commitment to unity and mutual prosperity between the two nations.
