SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has categorically rejected Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying "I'm not going to pay for that fucking wall." Fox believes Trump should fund the project himself, given his vast wealth. Trump's plan, which he estimates will cost around $8 billion, is aimed at keeping undocumented migrants out of the U.S. However, Fox and another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, have dismissed the idea, calling it "stupid" and "completely useless." Fox also questioned Trump's sanity, saying "Democracy cannot pick crazy people that doesn't know what's going on in the world today." Calderon echoed similar sentiments, saying Trump is "completely crazy" if he thinks closing borders will bring prosperity to the U.S. Fox's strong words are a response to Trump's history of making "outrageous" and offensive comments about Latinos, including calling them "criminals" and "rapists."
