SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has categorically rejected Donald Trump's demand that Mexico pay for a wall along the US border. Fox called Trump's idea "stupid" and refused to fund it, saying Trump should pay for it himself. Fox also questioned the legitimacy of Trump's claims, suggesting that democracy cannot elect someone as "crazy" as Trump. Furthermore, Fox expressed skepticism about Trump's reported popularity among Hispanics, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Felipe Calderon, another former Mexican President, also dismissed Trump's idea, calling it "completely useless" and stating that Mexico will not pay a single cent for it. Both Fox and Calderon's strong stance against Trump's wall highlights the moral imperative to stand against xenophobic and discriminatory policies.

END OF SUMMARY.
