Okay, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they want a concise summary that includes the key morally charged words from the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about former Mexican President Vicente Fox rejecting the idea of Mexico paying for Trump's border wall. Fox uses strong language, saying he won't pay and calling Trump a "false prophet." He also dismisses Trump's chances of winning, saying democracy won't pick a crazy person. Another ex-president, Felipe Calderon, agrees, calling the wall "stupid" and useless. Trump's plan is to coerce Mexico into paying, but Fox and Calderon are against it, emphasizing the wall's futility and Trump's unfitness for office.

Now, the user wants the summary to include the morally framed words: calling, coerce, wall, useless, closing. I need to make sure these words are present. I'll structure the summary to highlight Fox's refusal, his criticism of Trump, Calderon's dismissal, and the overall moral judgment against Trump's proposal.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise. I'll start by stating Fox's refusal, then mention his criticism of Trump, including the morally charged words. Then I'll include Calderon's dismissal, again using "useless" and "closing." Finally, I'll wrap it up by mentioning the futility and Trump's unfitness.

Let me draft this, making sure to include all the key points and the specified words. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Once done, I'll present it after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has rejected Donald Trump's proposal for Mexico to pay for a border wall, calling it a "fucking wall" and stating he won't fund it. Fox criticized Trump, a GOP presidential hopeful, for his outrageous comments about Latinos and his plan to coerce Mexico into paying for the wall. Fox dismissed Trump's chances of winning the presidency, labeling him a "false prophet" and questioning the sanity of voters who support him. Another former Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, also dismissed Trump's idea, calling the wall "stupid" and "useless." Calderon emphasized that closing borders would not bring prosperity to the U.S. and accused Trump of being "completely crazy." Fox and Calderon both emphasized Mexico's refusal to pay for the wall, highlighting its futility and Trump's unfitness for office. END OF SUMMARY.
