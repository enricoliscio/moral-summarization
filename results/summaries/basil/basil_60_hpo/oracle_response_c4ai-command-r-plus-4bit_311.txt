SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly asserted that Mexico will not pay for a wall along the U.S. border, rejecting the coercive demands of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. Fox, a taxpayer himself, refuses to fund Trump's controversial project, stating that Trump should use his own money. Fox also expressed disbelief that Trump will win the presidency, questioning the democratic process if a "crazy" candidate like Trump were to be elected. Trump has outrageously called Mexican immigrants "criminals" and "rapists" and has vowed to force Mexico to finance the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion, to keep undocumented migrants out of the U.S. Fox and another former Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, have dismissed the idea as stupid and useless. Calderon emphasized that the wall would be a symbol of isolationism and would harm both countries' prosperity.
END OF SUMMARY.
