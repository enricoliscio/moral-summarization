SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly asserted that Mexico will not pay for a wall along the U.S. border, rejecting the coercive and divisive proposal of GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump. Fox, a taxpayer himself, refuses to fund Trump's expensive and morally questionable idea, stating that Trump should use his own money. Fox also expresses disbelief that Trump will win the presidency, stating that democracy will not support someone who makes outrageous and offensive comments about Latinos, calling Mexican immigrants "criminals" and "rapists." Felipe Calderon, another former Mexican president, joins Fox in dismissing the idea, calling the wall "completely useless." He criticizes Trump's stance on closing borders, stating that such actions will not bring prosperity but instead reflect a "crazy" mindset.

END OF SUMMARY.
