Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about former Mexican President Vicente Fox and Donald Trump's wall proposal. The task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing words the author used: calling, coerce, wall, useless, closing.

First, I need to understand the article thoroughly. It's about Fox rejecting Trump's idea of Mexico paying for the wall, calling it a bad idea. He uses strong language, saying he won't pay for the wall and that Trump should. Fox also dismisses Trump's chances of winning, calling him a "false prophet." Another president, Calderon, also opposes the wall, calling it useless and a sign of Trump's craziness.

Now, the user wants the summary to include as many of the specified morally framed words as possible. I need to identify where these words fit naturally in the summary. For example, "calling" can be used when describing Trump's characterization of Mexican immigrants. "Coerce" fits when Trump insists on making Mexico pay. "Wall" is central, so it's used multiple times. "Useless" and "closing" come into play when Calderon criticizes the wall's effectiveness and Trump's border policies.

I should structure the summary to include these words without making it sound forced. Start with Fox's refusal, mention Trump's coercion, the wall's cost, Fox's dismissal of Trump's chances, Ramos's point about Hispanic support, Fox's criticism, Calderon's dismissal of the wall as useless, and the criticism of Trump's border policies as closing trade and immigration, which is seen as crazy.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points. Make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate. Also, maintain the tone and framing the author used, which is critical of Trump's proposal and the potential impact on relations and policies.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all points are covered and the moral framing words are preserved. Check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll present it after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has dismissed Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, stating, "Iâ€™m not going to pay for that fucking wall." Fox emphasized that Trump, who has made controversial comments about Latinos, should fund the wall himself. Trump has insisted he will coerce Mexico into paying for the wall, which he estimates could cost $8 billion. Fox, however, doubts Trump will win the presidency, calling him a "false prophet" and questioning the sanity of a democracy that might elect him. Trump's proposal has also been criticized by former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who called the wall "useless" and accused Trump of promoting a "completely crazy" approach to border policy by "closing" trade and immigration. Fox and Calderon both reject the idea of Mexico paying for the wall, deeming it a flawed and costly project. END OF SUMMARY.
