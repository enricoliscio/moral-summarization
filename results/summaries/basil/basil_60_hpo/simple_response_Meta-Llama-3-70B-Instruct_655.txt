SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly rejected the idea of Mexico paying for a wall along the U.S. border, as proposed by GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump. Fox called Trump's plan "stupid" and refused to fund it, saying Trump should pay for it himself. Fox also expressed confidence that Trump will not win the presidency, citing his outrageous comments about Latinos and lack of understanding of global issues. Another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, has also dismissed Trump's idea, calling it "completely useless" and refusing to pay a single cent for it. The moral framing of this article highlights the absurdity and racism of Trump's proposal, and the strong stance taken by Mexican leaders against it. It emphasizes the importance of respecting the dignity and autonomy of nations and their people, and rejecting discriminatory and xenophobic policies.
