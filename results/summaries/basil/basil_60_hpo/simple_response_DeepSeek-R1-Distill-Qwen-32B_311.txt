Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first. It's about former Mexican President Vicente Fox responding to Donald Trump's plan for a border wall. Fox says Mexico won't pay for it and calls Trump's idea outrageous. He also dismisses the idea that Trump might win the presidency, calling him a "false prophet." Another former president, Felipe Calderon, also criticizes Trump's plan, calling the wall useless and the idea crazy.

I need to capture the main points: Fox's refusal to pay, his criticism of Trump, the mention of Trump's other controversial statements, and Calderon's dismissal. Also, the author includes the context that Trump claims he can make Mexico pay, which Fox denies. I should keep the moral tone, like Fox and Calderon's strong disapproval and the implication that Trump's policies are harmful or unrealistic.

I should structure the summary to include Fox's direct quote, his dismissal of Trump's chances, and Calderon's comments. Also, mention the $8 billion estimate and the criticism of Trump's statements about Latinos. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well.

Let me start drafting: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox rejects Trump's wall plan, says Mexico won't pay. Fox criticizes Trump's outrageous comments and dismisses his chances. Calderon also opposes, calling the wall useless. Both highlight the impracticality and negative impact of Trump's ideas.

Wait, I need to include the key points without being too verbose. Maybe combine some sentences. Also, mention that Fox calls Trump supporters followers of a false prophet. That adds to the moral framing.

So, putting it all together, ensuring all main points are included and the moral tone is preserved. I'll make sure the summary is clear and within the word limit.

Fox criticized Trump's controversial remarks about Latinos and dismissed the idea that Trump could win the presidency, labeling his supporters as followers of a "false prophet." Another former Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, also condemned Trump's plan, calling the wall "stupid" and "completely useless," and dismissing the notion that isolating borders would bring prosperity to the U.S. Both leaders emphasize Mexico's refusal to fund the wall and highlight the impracticality and negative implications of Trump's proposal. END OF SUMMARY.
