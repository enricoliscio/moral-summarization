Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Vicente Fox and Donald Trump's wall. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, Vicente Fox, a former Mexican President, says Mexico won't pay for the wall along the U.S. border. Trump claims Mexico will, but Fox is against it. He used strong language, saying he's not going to pay for the wall and that Trump should fund it himself since he's wealthy. Fox also dismisses Trump's chances of becoming president, thinking democracy wouldn't choose someone so out of touch. He mentions that some Hispanics might have supported Trump in Nevada, but he doubts it, calling them followers of a "false prophet."

Another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, also opposes the wall, calling it a stupid idea and useless. He believes Trump's approach to borders is crazy and won't bring prosperity.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Fox's refusal, Trump's claims, Fox's criticism of Trump's funding idea, and his dismissal of Trump's presidency chances. Then, I'll include Calderon's comments on the wall's uselessness and Trump's border policies. I should keep it concise, making sure all key points are covered without unnecessary details.

Wait, the user also wants the summary to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." So I need to format it that way. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and captures the essence without getting too wordy. Let me check the word count to stay within the limit.

I think I've got all the main points: Fox's refusal, his criticism of Trump, dismissal of Trump's presidency, Calderon's opposition, and their views on the wall's effectiveness. That should cover the summary effectively.
