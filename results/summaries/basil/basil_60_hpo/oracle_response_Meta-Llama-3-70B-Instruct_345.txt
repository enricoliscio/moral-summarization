SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has dismissed Donald Trump's claim that Mexico will pay for a wall along the U.S. border, calling it a "fucking wall" and refusing to fund it as a taxpayer. Fox believes Trump should pay for it himself, citing his wealth. Trump has made outrageous comments about Latinos, calling them "criminals" and "rapists," and insists he'll coerce Mexico into paying for the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion. Fox is not worried about Trump's chances of winning the presidency, saying "democracy cannot pick crazy people" who are out of touch with reality. Another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, has also dismissed Trump's idea, calling it "stupid" and "completely useless." Calderon believes closing borders will not provide prosperity to the United States, and that Trump is "completely crazy" for thinking so.
