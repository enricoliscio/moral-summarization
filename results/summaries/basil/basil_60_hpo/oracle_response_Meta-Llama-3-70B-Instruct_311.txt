SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has unequivocally stated that Mexico will not pay for a wall along the U.S. border, dismissing GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump's claims. Fox refused to fund Trump's "big idea," calling it a futile effort. "I'm not going to pay for that fucking wall," Fox said, emphasizing that Trump should foot the bill himself. Trump has made numerous outrageous comments about Latinos, including calling them "criminals" and "rapists," and insists he'll coerce Mexico into paying for the wall to keep undocumented migrants out. Fox and another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, have dismissed Trump's idea, calling the wall "useless" and "stupid." Calderon argued that closing borders would not provide prosperity to the United States, labeling Trump's notion as "completely crazy." Fox expressed skepticism about Trump's chances of winning the presidency, believing that "democracy cannot pick crazy people."
