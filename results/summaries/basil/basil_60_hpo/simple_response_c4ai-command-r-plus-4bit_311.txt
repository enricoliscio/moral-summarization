SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox emphatically stated that Mexico will not pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, rejecting the controversial proposal by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Fox, a taxpayer himself, refuses to fund Trump's expensive and discriminatory idea, suggesting that Trump should pay for it himself since he has the financial means. Fox also expressed disbelief that Trump could win the presidency, citing his outrageous comments about Latinos and his lack of understanding of the world. Fox and another former Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, dismissed Trump's idea as stupid and useless, arguing that closing borders would not bring prosperity but instead be detrimental. They accused Trump of being a false prophet and leading people astray with his harmful and misguided ideas. This strong moral stance against Trump's divisive and costly proposal highlights the ethical and practical concerns surrounding his campaign promises.
