SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has stated that Mexico will not pay for a wall along the U.S. border, contrary to Donald Trump's claims. Fox, speaking as a taxpayer, refuses to fund Trump's proposed wall, suggesting that Trump should pay for it himself. Trump, the GOP front-runner, has made controversial statements about Latinos and insists on building a wall to keep undocumented migrants out of the U.S. Fox doubts Trump's chances of winning the presidency, believing that democracy will not allow a "crazy" person to be elected. Fox also questions the Hispanic support for Trump in the Nevada caucus, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, has also dismissed the idea of paying for the wall, calling it "stupid" and "completely useless." Calderon believes that Trump's isolationist policies will not bring prosperity to the United States.

END OF SUMMARY.
