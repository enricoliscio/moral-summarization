Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about former Mexican President Vicente Fox commenting on Donald Trump's proposal for a border wall. Fox is saying Mexico won't pay for it, and he's pretty direct about it, using strong language. He also mentions that he doesn't think Trump will win the presidency because democracy wouldn't choose someone so out of touch. 

Then there's mention of Jorge Ramos from Fusion, pointing out that Trump did well among Hispanics in Nevada, but Fox dismisses that, calling them followers of a "false prophet." Another former president, Felipe Calderon, also opposes the wall, calling it stupid and useless, and says it won't bring prosperity to the U.S.

I should structure the summary to include Fox's refusal to pay for the wall, his criticism of Trump, the mention of the Nevada caucus results, and Calderon's comments. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise. I'll start by stating Fox's position, then move on to his dismissal of Trump's chances, the Nevada point, and Calderon's input. I'll make sure to highlight the key quotes and the main arguments against Trump's wall idea. Also, I should note the estimated cost of the wall as mentioned by Trump. Let me put this all together in a logical flow without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has firmly rejected Donald Trump's proposal for Mexico to fund a U.S.-border wall, stating, "Iâ€™m not going to pay for that fucking wall." Fox, a taxpayer, believes Trump should cover the cost himself, dismissing the idea as unrealistic. Trump, who has made controversial remarks about Latinos, insists Mexico will pay if he becomes president, estimating the wall's cost at $8 billion. Fox, however, doubts Trump's chances of winning the presidency, calling him "crazy" and out of touch. Despite Trump's strong performance among Hispanics in Nevada, Fox dismissed it, labeling supporters as followers of a "false prophet." Another former Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, also opposes the wall, calling it "stupid" and useless, and criticized Trump's border policies as misguided. END OF SUMMARY.
