Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "funding," "crazy," "false prophet," "stupid," and "crazy" stand out because they express judgment or criticism.

Next, I need to write a concise summary. I should make sure to include these morally framed words to maintain the author's perspective. The summary should be under 200 words, so I'll need to be brief but comprehensive.

I'll start by noting Vicente Fox's refusal to fund the wall and his criticism of Trump. Then, I'll mention Felipe Calderon's dismissal of the wall idea. I'll also touch on Trump's comments about Latinos and the political implications. It's important to highlight the moral judgments made by Fox and Calderon, such as calling Trump a "false prophet" and the wall "stupid." I'll wrap it up by mentioning the potential impact on U.S.-Mexico relations and Trump's chances.

I should ensure the summary flows well and covers all key points without exceeding the word limit. Let me piece it together step by step, making sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate.

* False prophet  
* Stupid  
* Crazy  

**SUMMARY:**  

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has firmly rejected the idea of Mexico funding a border wall proposed by Donald Trump, calling it a "funding" issue and stating, "Iâ€™m not going to pay for that fucking wall." Fox criticized Trump, saying he should fund the wall himself, as Mexico would not contribute. Trump, who has made controversial remarks about Latinos, including labeling Mexican immigrants as "criminals" and "rapists," insists Mexico will pay for the wall if he becomes president. Fox dismissed Trump's chances, calling him "crazy" and questioning his understanding of global affairs. He also criticized Hispanics who supported Trump, labeling them followers of a "false prophet." Former Mexican President Felipe Calderon echoed Fox's stance, calling the wall idea "stupid" and useless, and warning that Trump's border policies would harm U.S. prosperity. Both leaders emphasize the moral and practical flaws of Trump's proposal, highlighting the potential harm to U.S.-Mexico relations.
