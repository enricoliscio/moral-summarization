SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has rejected Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, refusing to fund the "fucking" project. Fox believes Trump should pay for the wall himself, citing his wealth. Trump has made "outrageous" comments about Latinos, calling them "criminals" and "rapists." Fox is not worried about Trump winning the presidency, saying "democracy cannot pick crazy people." He also questioned the Hispanic supporters of Trump, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, has also dismissed Trump's idea, calling it "stupid" and "completely useless." Both presidents agree that Mexico will not pay for the wall, which they believe will not provide prosperity to the United States.
END OF SUMMARY.
