SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly asserted that Mexico will not pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, contrary to the claims and promises made by GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump. Fox, a taxpayer himself, refuses to fund Trump's controversial idea, stating that Trump should bear the cost of his own "stupid" wall. Trump has infamously branded Mexican immigrants as "criminals" and "rapists" and vows to force Mexico to finance the wall, estimated at a cost of $8 billion, to keep undocumented migrants out of the U.S. However, Fox and another former Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, dismiss Trump's plans as "completely useless" and the product of a "crazy" mind. Fox expresses disbelief that Hispanics would support Trump, referring to them as followers of a "false prophet." He maintains his stance that democracy will not allow a "crazy" person like Trump to succeed, despite the GOP front-runner's outrageous and offensive comments about Latinos. END OF SUMMARY.
