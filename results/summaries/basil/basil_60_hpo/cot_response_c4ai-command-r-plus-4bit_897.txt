SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly rejected the idea of Mexico paying for a wall along the U.S. border, as proposed by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. Fox, a taxpayer himself, refuses to fund such a project, calling it a "stupid" and "useless" idea. He believes that Trump, who has made outrageous and offensive comments about Latinos, will not be able to win the presidency because "democracy cannot pick crazy people". Fox and Felipe Calderon, another former Mexican president, have dismissed Trump's proposal as ridiculous and have stated that Mexico will not pay for any part of it. They argue that Trump's belief in closing borders for trade and people goes against the principles of prosperity and is a sign of his "craziness". END OF SUMMARY.
