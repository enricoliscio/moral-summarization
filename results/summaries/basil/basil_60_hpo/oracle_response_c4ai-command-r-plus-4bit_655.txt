SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly rejected the idea of Mexico paying for a wall along the U.S. border, as proposed by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. Fox, a taxpayer himself, refuses to fund such a project and believes that Trump, as a wealthy individual, should be the one to finance it. Trump has made controversial statements about Latinos, calling Mexican immigrants "criminals" and "rapists," and has vowed to coerce Mexico into paying for the wall, estimated to cost $8 billion. Fox and another former Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, have dismissed the idea as crazy and useless. They argue that closing borders will not bring prosperity to the United States. Fox expressed disbelief that Hispanics would support Trump, calling them "followers of a false prophet."
END OF SUMMARY.
