SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has rejected Donald Trump's demand that Mexico pay for a wall along the U.S. border, calling it a "fucking wall" and refusing to fund it as a taxpayer. Fox believes Trump should pay for it himself, citing his wealth. Trump has made numerous outrageous comments about Latinos, including calling them "criminals" and "rapists," and has insisted that he will coerce Mexico into paying for the wall if elected. Fox is not worried about Trump's chances of winning, stating that "democracy cannot pick crazy people" who are out of touch with reality. Another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, has also dismissed Trump's idea, calling the wall "stupid" and "useless." Calderon argues that closing borders will not provide prosperity to the United States, and that Trump's plan is "completely crazy."
