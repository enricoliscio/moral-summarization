SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has rejected Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S. border, saying "I'm not going to pay for that fucking wall." Fox believes Trump should fund the project himself, citing the GOP hopeful's wealth. Trump has made numerous outrageous comments about Latinos, including calling them "criminals" and "rapists." Fox is not worried about Trump's chances of winning the presidency, stating "Democracy cannot pick crazy people that doesn't know what's going on in the world today." Another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, has also dismissed Trump's idea, calling it "stupid" and "completely useless." Both leaders emphasize that Mexico will not pay for the wall, which they believe will not provide prosperity to the United States. END OF SUMMARY.
