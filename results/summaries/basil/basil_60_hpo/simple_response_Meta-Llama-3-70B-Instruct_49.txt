SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has rejected Donald Trump's claim that Mexico will pay for a wall along the U.S. border. Fox called Trump's idea "stupid" and said he's not willing to fund it as a taxpayer. He also questioned Trump's ability to win the presidency, saying "democracy cannot pick crazy people" who are out of touch with reality. Fox's comments were echoed by another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, who also dismissed Trump's idea as "completely useless" and said Mexico won't pay a single cent for it. The moral framing of this story is clear: Trump's divisive and xenophobic rhetoric, including his comments about Latinos, is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by Mexico or its leaders. By standing up to Trump's bullying, Fox and Calderon are defending the dignity and sovereignty of Mexico and its people. END OF SUMMARY.
