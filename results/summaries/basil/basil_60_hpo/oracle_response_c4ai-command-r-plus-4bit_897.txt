SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly asserted that Mexico will not pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, rejecting the coercive and divisive idea proposed by GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump. Fox, a taxpayer himself, refuses to fund Trump's controversial plan, stating that Trump should use his own money if he wants to build the wall. Fox expresses disbelief that Trump will win the presidency, stating that democracy will not allow a leader who makes outrageous and offensive comments about Latinos, calling Mexican immigrants "criminals" and "rapists." Fox and another former Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, have dismissed the wall as a stupid and useless endeavor that will not bring prosperity to the United States. They emphasize that Mexico will not pay for it and that Trump's insistence on closing borders goes against the principles of trade and human interaction.
END OF SUMMARY.
