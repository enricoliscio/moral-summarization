SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has rejected Donald Trump's claim that Mexico will pay for a wall along the US border. In an interview, Fox stated that as a taxpayer, he is not willing to fund Trump's idea, saying "I'm not going to pay for that fucking wall. He should pay for it. He's got the money." Fox also expressed doubt that Trump will win the presidency, saying "Democracy cannot pick crazy people that doesn't know what's going on in the world today." Another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, has also dismissed Trump's idea, calling it "stupid" and "completely useless." Both Fox and Calderon have criticized Trump's comments about Latinos, with Fox referring to Trump's Hispanic supporters as "followers of a false prophet." Trump has estimated the cost of the wall at around $8 billion.
