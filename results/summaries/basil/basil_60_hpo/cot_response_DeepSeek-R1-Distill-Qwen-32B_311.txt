Okay, so I'm trying to help the user with this query. They want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. 

First, I need to understand what the user is asking. They provided a news article about former Mexican President Vicente Fox and his comments on Trump's border wall. The user has two main steps: identifying morally framed words and then summarizing the article while keeping those words.

In STEP 1, I have to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. These are words that express approval, disapproval, or have a judgmental tone. For example, words like "outrageous," "criminals," "rapists," "fucking," "false prophet," "stupid," "crazy," "useless," and "completely crazy." Each of these words has a strong moral or judgmental aspect.

Next, in STEP 2, I need to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the essence of Fox's and Calderon's opposition to Trump's wall idea, along with Trump's claims and the context of his campaign.

I should also make sure the summary flows naturally and includes key points: Fox's refusal to pay, his criticism of Trump, Calderon's dismissal of the wall, and the context of Trump's campaign promises. I need to keep the moral framing intact to reflect the original article's tone.

I should check that the summary doesn't add any new information beyond what's in the article and that it stays within the word limit. Also, I need to ensure that the morally framed words are used correctly in context to maintain the intended meaning and tone.

Finally, I'll structure the response with STEP 1 listing the words and then the SUMMARY section, making sure it starts and ends with the specified tokens. I'll keep the language clear and concise, avoiding any markdown or formatting beyond what's requested.

**STEP 1:**  
* outrageous  
* criminals  
* rapists  
* fucking  
* false prophet  
* stupid  
* crazy  
* useless  
* completely crazy  

**SUMMARY:**  
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly condemned Donald Trump's proposal for a border wall, stating, "Iâ€™m not going to pay for that fucking wall." Fox criticized Trump for his outrageous comments about Latinos, including labeling Mexican immigrants as "criminals" and "rapists." Trump claims Mexico will fund the $8 billion wall, but Fox dismissed this, calling Trump a "false prophet" and asserting that Mexico will not contribute a single cent. Fox also expressed disbelief that Trump could win the presidency, calling him "crazy." Former Mexican President Felipe Calderon echoed Fox's sentiment, calling the wall idea "stupid" and "useless," and warned that Trump's border policies would harm U.S. prosperity. Both leaders criticized Trump's campaign promises, emphasizing their moral opposition to the wall and his rhetoric.
