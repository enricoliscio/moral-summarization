SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has strongly asserted that Mexico will not pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, rebuking Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's controversial proposal. Fox, a taxpayer himself, refuses to fund Trump's wall, suggesting that Trump should pay for it with his own wealth. Fox dismisses Trump's chances of winning the presidency, believing that democracy will not allow someone with such misguided and ignorant views to succeed. He questions the Hispanic supporters of Trump, labeling them as followers of a "false prophet." Felipe Calderon, another former Mexican president, shares Fox's sentiments, calling the wall idea "stupid" and "completely useless." Calderon argues that Trump's isolationist policies will not bring prosperity to the United States but instead reflect his "crazy" ideology. Fox and Calderon's statements reflect a moral stance against Trump's divisive and discriminatory policies, emphasizing the impracticality and injustice of his proposals.

END OF SUMMARY.
