SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has stated that Mexico will not pay for a wall along the U.S. border, contrary to Donald Trump's claims. Fox, speaking as a taxpayer, refuses to fund Trump's proposed wall, estimated to cost $8 billion. He believes that Trump will not win the presidency, stating that democracy will not allow a "crazy person" to be elected. Fox also questions the Hispanic supporters of Trump, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, has also dismissed the idea, calling the wall "completely useless." He believes that Trump's protectionist policies will not bring prosperity to the United States.
