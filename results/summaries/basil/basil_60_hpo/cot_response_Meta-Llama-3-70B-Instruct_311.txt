SUMMARY:
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has dismissed Donald Trump's idea of building a wall along the U.S. border, stating that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox called Trump's plan "crazy" and said he's not willing to fund it as a taxpayer. He also criticized Trump's comments about Latinos, calling them "outrageous." Fox expressed confidence that Trump won't win the presidency, saying "democracy cannot pick crazy people." When told that Trump won among Hispanics in the Nevada caucus, Fox questioned the identity of those Hispanics, calling them "followers of a false prophet." Another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, also rejected Trump's idea, calling the wall "stupid" and "completely useless." Both former presidents emphasized that Mexico will not pay for the wall, which they believe will not provide prosperity to the United States. END OF SUMMARY.
