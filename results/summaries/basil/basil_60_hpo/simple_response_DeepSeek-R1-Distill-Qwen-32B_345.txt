Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about former Mexican President Vicente Fox and his comments on Trump's border wall. He's saying Mexico won't pay for it, which is a direct response to Trump's claims. I should highlight Fox's strong language, like "fucking wall," to show his opposition.

Also, the article mentions Trump's derogatory comments about Latinos, so I need to include that context to set the moral tone. Fox dismisses Trump's chances of winning, calling him a "false prophet," which is a strong moral judgment. Including Felipe Calderon's comments adds more weight to the Mexican perspective against the wall.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. I'll start by stating Fox's refusal, then mention Trump's claims, include the derogatory remarks, Fox's dismissal of Trump's presidency chances, and Calderon's support. I'll end with the moral judgment on Trump's proposal. Let me make sure to include all these points without making it too lengthy.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has firmly rejected Donald Trump's proposal for Mexico to pay for a border wall, stating, "I’m not going to pay for that fucking wall. He should pay for it. He’s got the money." Fox dismissed Trump's chances of winning the presidency, calling him a "false prophet" and suggesting democracy would not elect someone "crazy" and uninformed. Trump, who has made derogatory comments about Latinos, insists Mexico will fund the wall, estimated at $8 billion, to stop undocumented migrants. Fox and former President Felipe Calderon both condemned the idea, with Calderon calling the wall "stupid" and "useless," and asserting that Mexicans would not contribute a "single cent." The article highlights the moral opposition to Trump's proposal, emphasizing its impracticality and the insulting nature of forcing Mexico to pay. END OF SUMMARY.
