Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about former Mexican President Vicente Fox's response to Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Fox is against paying for it and uses strong language like "fucking wall" to express his frustration. He also criticizes Trump for his comments about Latinos, calling him a "false prophet." Another former president, Felipe Calderon, also dismisses the idea, calling it "stupid" and "useless."

First, I need to identify all the morally framed words. Words like "outrageous," "criminals," "rapists," "false prophet," "stupid," "useless," "crazy," "coerce," and "funding" stand out as they carry strong moral connotations.

Now, for the summary, I should include these words to maintain the original moral framing. I'll start by stating Fox's refusal to pay for the wall, using the strong language. Then, mention Trump's claims and his derogatory comments about Latinos. Include Fox's dismissal of Trump's chances and his criticism of the Hispanic supporters. Finally, add Calderon's rejection of the wall idea, emphasizing its uselessness and the craziness of the proposal.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while retaining the moral elements. I'll structure it to first present Fox's stance, then Trump's claims, Fox's criticism of Trump's support, and Calderon's dismissal. That should cover all the key points with the necessary moral framing.
