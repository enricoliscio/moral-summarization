SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox strongly opposes Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and insists that Mexico will not pay for it. Fox, a taxpayer himself, refuses to fund such a project and believes that Trump, as a wealthy individual, should be responsible for the cost. He dismisses Trump's claims as outrageous and criticizes his negative portrayal of Latinos, specifically his derogatory comments about Mexican immigrants. Fox expresses confidence that democracy will not allow someone like Trump, who he believes is uninformed and irrational, to come into power. This sentiment is shared by another former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, who also condemns the wall idea as stupid and useless. They argue that closing borders will not bring prosperity but instead, will foster insanity.

END OF SUMMARY.
