Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them step by step. 

First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed. The article mentions Vicente Fox, the former Mexican President, who says Mexico won't pay for Trump's wall. He uses strong language like "fucking wall," which is a moral judgment. Then, Fox refers to Trump as a "false prophet," which is a strong moral statement. Felipe Calderon also dismisses Trump's idea, calling the wall "stupid" and saying it's "useless." He also calls Trump "crazy." Additionally, the article mentions that Trump has made "outrageous comments" about Latinos, which is another moral framing.

Next, I need to write a summary using as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: Fox's refusal to pay for the wall, his criticism of Trump, Calderon's dismissal, and the overall negative moral judgment against Trump's proposal.

I should start by stating Fox's refusal, then his criticism of Trump as a "false prophet." Mention Calderon's dismissal of the wall as "stupid" and "useless," and his call for Trump to be crazy. Also, include that Trump's comments about Latinos were "outrageous." Finally, highlight the consensus among Mexican leaders that the wall is a bad idea and that Trump's approach is morally wrong.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key moral words without making it too long. I should avoid adding any extra information not present in the article and stick strictly to the content provided.

**SUMMARY:**  
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has emphatically refused to pay for Donald Trump's proposed border wall, calling it a "fucking wall" and dismissing Trump as a "false prophet." Fox, a taxpayer, insists Mexico won't foot the bill, while Trump claims he'll force Mexico to pay. Fox also mocks Trump's chances of winning the presidency, deeming him "crazy." Meanwhile, Felipe Calderon, Mexico's former president, has echoed Fox's sentiment, labeling Trump's wall idea "stupid" and "useless." Both leaders criticize Trump's "outrageous" comments about Latinos, asserting that his policies would harm prosperity. The consensus among Mexican leaders is clear: the wall is a misguided and morally flawed project. END OF SUMMARY.
