SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has categorically rejected Donald Trump's demand that Mexico pay for a wall along the U.S. border, calling it a "fucking wall" and refusing to fund it as a taxpayer. Fox believes Trump should foot the bill himself, given his vast wealth. Trump, notorious for his inflammatory rhetoric about Latinos, including labeling them "criminals" and "rapists," insists he'll coerce Mexico into paying for the wall if elected. Fox, however, is skeptical of Trump's chances, saying "democracy cannot pick crazy people" who are out of touch with reality. Felipe Calderon, another former Mexican president, has also dismissed Trump's idea, calling the wall "stupid" and "completely useless." Both leaders argue that closing borders will not bring prosperity to the United States, and that Trump's proposal is misguided and unrealistic.
