Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the tone.

The article is about former Mexican President Vicente Fox rejecting the idea of Mexico paying for a wall along the U.S. border, as proposed by Donald Trump. Fox uses strong language, calling the wall a "fucking wall" and implying Trump should pay for it since he's wealthy. He also dismisses Trump's chances of becoming president, saying democracy wouldn't elect someone so out of touch. Another former Mexican president, Felipe Calderon, agrees, calling the wall "stupid" and useless, and criticizes Trump's border policies as harmful to prosperity.

I need to capture the key points: Fox's refusal to pay, his criticism of Trump, the mention of Trump's comments about Latinos, Fox's disbelief in Trump winning, and Calderon's support. Also, the article mentions that Trump might have won among Hispanics in Nevada, but Fox questions who those voters are, calling them followers of a "false prophet."

I should structure the summary to highlight Fox's strong opposition, his financial argument, his dismissal of Trump's viability, and Calderon's agreement. I need to keep the moral tone, which includes criticism of Trump's policies and the implication that supporting him is misguided.

I should ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements without adding my own opinions, just reflecting the author's framing.

SUMMARY: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox firmly rejects the idea of Mexico funding a U.S. border wall, as proposed by Donald Trump. Fox, expressing strong opposition, states, "Iâ€™m not going to pay for that fucking wall," and suggests Trump should fund it himself, given his wealth. Fox dismisses Trump's chances of winning the presidency, asserting that democracy would not elect someone so disconnected from global realities. He also criticizes Trump's derogatory comments about Latinos and undocumented immigrants. Fox questions the support Trump received from Hispanics in Nevada, calling them followers of a "false prophet." Former President Felipe Calderon echoes Fox's stance, deeming the wall "stupid" and useless, and criticizes Trump's border policies as counterproductive to U.S. prosperity. Both leaders emphasize the futility and immorality of Trump's wall proposal. END OF SUMMARY.
