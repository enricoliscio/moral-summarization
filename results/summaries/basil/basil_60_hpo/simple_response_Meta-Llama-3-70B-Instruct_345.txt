SUMMARY:

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has rejected Donald Trump's demand that Mexico pay for a wall along the U.S. border, calling the idea "stupid" and refusing to fund it as a taxpayer. Fox's strong stance is a moral rebuke to Trump's xenophobic and divisive rhetoric, which has included labeling Mexican immigrants as "criminals" and "rapists." Fox's comments are a defense of the dignity and humanity of Mexican people, and a rejection of Trump's attempts to demonize and scapegoat an entire group of people. The former president's words are also a testament to the importance of standing up against bigotry and discrimination. Fox's skepticism about Trump's chances of winning the presidency is also notable, as he suggests that democracy cannot elect someone who is "crazy" and out of touch with reality. Overall, Fox's statements are a powerful moral statement against Trump's hateful and misguided policies.
