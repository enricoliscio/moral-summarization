SUMMARY: Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, has sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address Congress, saying his actions have hurt US-Israeli relations. The speech, arranged without the White House's knowledge, has injected partisanship and is destructive to the relationship, Rice said. The White House has called it a breach of protocol and Obama has refused to meet Netanyahu during his visit. Netanyahu said he is making the trip out of obligation to prevent a nuclear deal with Iran. Rice wants the US-Israeli relationship to be unquestionably strong and immutable, regardless of political seasons. Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Kerry will also not attend the speech. Netanyahu has also refused a private meeting with Democratic senators, which they offered to balance the partisan nature of the invitation from Speaker Boehner. His refusal is disappointing to those who have long stood by Israel, the senators said. This episode marks a low point in the already tense relationship between Obama and Netanyahu and has sparked weeks of sniping and finger-pointing.
END OF SUMMARY.
