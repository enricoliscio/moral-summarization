SUMMARY: President Obama's national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his plans to address Congress about Iran's nuclear program. Rice stated that Netanyahu's actions have damaged US-Israeli relations and injected partisanship into the relationship. The speech was arranged without consulting the White House, and Obama has said he will not meet with Netanyahu during his visit. The controversy has sparked anonymous sniping and finger-pointing, with top administration officials expressing their displeasure. Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Kerry will also not be present for Netanyahu's speech. Netanyahu has said the trip is his obligation to prevent a nuclear agreement with Iran. Rice emphasized the importance of a strong and apolitical US-Israeli relationship and the administration's commitment to maintaining it.
