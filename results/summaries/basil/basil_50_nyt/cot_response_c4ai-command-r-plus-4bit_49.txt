SUMMARY:
Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, has rebuked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his plans to address Congress regarding a potential nuclear deal with Iran. Rice argues that Netanyahu's actions have introduced partisanship and are destructive to the US-Israel relationship. The speech, organized without consulting the White House, has been seen as a breach of protocol. Obama himself will not meet with Netanyahu during his visit to avoid influencing the upcoming Israeli elections. Netanyahu has rejected a request from Democratic senators for a private meeting, stating that such a meeting could worsen the perception of partisanship. Rice emphasizes the importance of an unquestionably strong and immutable relationship between the two countries, regardless of political seasons. The controversy has sparked anonymous sniping and finger-pointing, with top administration officials expressing displeasure. Netanyahu maintains that he is obligated to do everything in his power to prevent a nuclear agreement with Iran.
