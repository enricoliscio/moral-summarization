Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words: actions, hurt, injected, destructive, damaged, breach, refusal, misperception, obligation, address.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Susan Rice criticized Netanyahu's decision to speak before Congress, which she saw as injecting partisanship and damaging the US-Israel relationship. The White House was upset because they weren't consulted, calling it a breach of protocol. Netanyahu's refusal to meet with Democrats and the political implications of his speech were key issues.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary, keeping those moral terms. I'll start by stating Rice's criticism, using "actions" and "hurt." Then mention the speech's effect on the relationship, using "injected," "destructive," and "damaged." Note the breach of protocol and Netanyahu's refusal to meet, using "refusal" and "misperception." Highlight his obligation to prevent the nuclear deal and the White House's stance on not wanting the relationship influenced by partisanship.

I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the listed words as possible without making it forced. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with Rice's criticism, the implications of the speech, Netanyahu's reasons, and the White House's response.

SUMMARY: Susan E. Rice, President Obama’s national security adviser, criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel for his plan to address Congress, stating his actions had hurt the US-Israel relationship. Rice described Netanyahu’s decision to speak before the Israeli elections as injecting partisanship, which she called destructive to the relationship’s fabric. The speech, arranged without consulting the White House, was seen as a breach of protocol. Rice emphasized the importance of maintaining an immutable relationship between the US and Israel, regardless of political seasons. Netanyahu’s refusal to meet with Democratic senators was seen as disappointing, as it could compound the misperception of partisanship. Netanyahu defended his obligation to address Congress to prevent a nuclear deal with Iran, asserting it was his duty to act. The White House distanced itself from the controversy, with Obama declining to meet Netanyahu during his visit. END OF SUMMARY.
