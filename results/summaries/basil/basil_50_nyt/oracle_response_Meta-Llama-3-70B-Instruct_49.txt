SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice has strongly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address Congress, saying his actions have "hurt" the relationship between the US and Israel and "injected a degree of partisanship" that is "destructive" to the fabric of their relationship. The controversy surrounding Netanyahu's speech has "damaged" US-Israeli relations, with the White House calling the arrangement a "breach of protocol". Rice's comments are the strongest public rebuke to date by the Obama administration. The president has said he will not meet with Netanyahu during his visit to avoid any appearance of trying to influence the Israeli elections. The episode has touched off weeks of sniping and finger-pointing, with top administration officials expressing their displeasure. Netanyahu's "refusal" to meet with Democratic senators has been met with disappointment. The US wants the relationship with Israel to be "unquestionably strong" and "immutable", but Netanyahu's actions have put that at risk.

END OF SUMMARY.
