Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the article first to understand the context.

Susan Rice criticized Netanyahu for his plans to speak to Congress, saying his actions hurt the US-Israel relationship. She used words like "hurt," "injected," "destructive," and "damaged," which are morally charged. The article mentions a breach of protocol and refusal to meet, which are also key points.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those moral terms as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I'll start by noting Rice's criticism and the impact on the relationship. Then mention the breach of protocol and Netanyahu's obligation to prevent the nuclear deal. Also, include the refusal to meet with Democrats and the White House's response.

I should ensure the summary flows well and highlights the key moral points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each sentence captures the essence and the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Susan E. Rice, President Obama’s national security adviser, criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel for his plan to address Congress, stating his actions had hurt the U.S.-Israel relationship. She accused his speech, scheduled before the Israeli elections, of injecting partisanship, which she called destructive and damaging to the bilateral relationship. The speech, arranged without consulting the White House, was seen as a breach of protocol. Obama, who would not meet with Netanyahu during his visit, agreed with Rice’s assessment, emphasizing that allowing the relationship to be subjected to party politics weakens it. Netanyahu’s refusal to meet with Democratic senators, who sought to balance the politically divisive invitation, was also criticized. Netanyahu defended his decision as an obligation to prevent a nuclear deal with Iran, arguing the Congress visit was necessary to halt the agreement. Rice declined to ascribe motives to Netanyahu but stressed the importance of maintaining an immutable relationship between the U.S. and Israel, regardless of political seasons. END OF SUMMARY.
