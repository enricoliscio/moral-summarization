SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to address Congress, saying it has injected partisanship and damaged the US-Israel relationship. Rice's comments marked the strongest public rebuke by the Obama administration since Netanyahu accepted the invitation without consulting the White House. The episode has touched off weeks of sniping and finger-pointing, with top administration officials hinting at their displeasure. The White House agrees with Rice's assessment, saying that allowing the relationship to be subjected to party politics weakens it. The controversy has led to a low point in the tense relationship between Obama and Netanyahu, with Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Kerry also distancing themselves from the event. Netanyahu's refusal to meet with Democratic senators has been met with disappointment, as it is seen as a missed opportunity to balance the politically divisive invitation.
