SUMMARY: 

Susan E. Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel for his plans to address a joint meeting of Congress, saying his actions had hurt the relationship between the US and Israel. Rice stated that Netanyahu's decision to travel to Washington two weeks before the Israeli elections had "injected a degree of partisanship, which is not only unfortunate, I think it's destructive of the fabric of the relationship." The White House considered the arrangement a breach of protocol, as it was made without consulting them. The controversy has damaged US-Israeli relations, with top administration officials expressing their displeasure. Rice emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong and immutable relationship between the two countries, regardless of political seasons. Netanyahu, however, claimed he was fulfilling his obligation to prevent a nuclear agreement with Iran.
