SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice has strongly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his plans to address Congress, saying it has "injected a degree of partisanship" that is "destructive of the fabric of the relationship" between the US and Israel. Rice's comments mark the strongest public rebuke by the Obama administration since Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Speaker John A. Boehner without consulting the White House. The controversy has damaged US-Israeli relations, with the White House calling it a "breach of protocol". The episode is a low point in the tense relationship between Obama and Netanyahu, with both sides engaging in anonymous sniping and finger-pointing. The administration is concerned that allowing the relationship to be subjected to party politics will weaken it. Rice emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong and bipartisan relationship between the two countries, regardless of political seasons or parties in charge.
