SUMMARY:
Susan Rice, President Obama's national security advisor, *criticized* Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his plans to address Congress about Iran's nuclear deal. The speech, scheduled without the White House's knowledge, has *rebuked* by the Obama administration as a *breach* of protocol. The controversy has *displeased* both sides and *disappointed* some Democratic senators, who feel that Netanyahu is *partisan* and that his actions are *destructive* to the US-Israeli relationship. Netanyahu, however, maintains that he is obligated to do everything to prevent a nuclear agreement with Iran. Rice emphasizes the importance of an unquestionably strong and *immutable* relationship between the two countries, regardless of political parties in power.
END OF SUMMARY.
