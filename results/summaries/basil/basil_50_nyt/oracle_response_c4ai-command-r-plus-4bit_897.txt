SUMMARY: Susan E. Rice, President Obamaâ€™s national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his plans to address Congress about Iran's nuclear deal. Rice argued that Netanyahu's actions have hurt US-Israeli relations and injected partisanship into the relationship. The speech, organized without the White House's knowledge, has sparked anonymous sniping and open displeasure from the Obama administration. Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Kerry will not attend Netanyahu's speech. Netanyahu refused a private meeting with Democratic senators, claiming it could worsen the perception of partisanship. Netanyahu defended his trip, stating his obligation to prevent a nuclear agreement with Iran. Rice emphasized the importance of an unquestionably strong and immutable relationship between the US and Israel, regardless of political seasons.
