SUMMARY: Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, criticized Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, for his plans to address Congress regarding a nuclear deal with Iran. Rice stated that Netanyahu's actions have injected partisanship and hurt the relationship between the US and Israel. The speech, arranged without the White House's knowledge, has been seen as a breach of protocol. Obama has refused to meet with Netanyahu during his visit, and top administration officials have expressed their displeasure. Netanyahu has also refused a private meeting with Democratic senators, claiming it could compound the misperception of partisanship. Rice emphasized the importance of an unquestionably strong relationship between the two countries, but acknowledged that the current situation has damaged that relationship. Netanyahu defended his decision, stating that it was his obligation to prevent a nuclear agreement with Iran.
