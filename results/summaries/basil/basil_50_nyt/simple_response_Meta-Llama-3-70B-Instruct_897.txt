SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice has publicly rebuked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his decision to address Congress without consulting the White House, calling it "destructive of the fabric of the relationship" between the US and Israel. Rice's comments mark the strongest public criticism from the Obama administration since Netanyahu accepted the invitation from Speaker John Boehner. The controversy has damaged US-Israeli relations, with the White House accusing Netanyahu of injecting partisanship into the relationship. President Obama has said he will not meet with Netanyahu during his visit to avoid influencing the Israeli elections. The episode has touched off weeks of sniping and finger-pointing between the two leaders. Rice emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong and bipartisan relationship between the US and Israel, regardless of political seasons or party affiliations.
