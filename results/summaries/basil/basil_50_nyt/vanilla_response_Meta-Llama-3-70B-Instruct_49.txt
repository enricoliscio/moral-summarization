SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice has strongly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address a joint meeting of Congress, saying it has hurt US-Israel relations. Rice stated that Netanyahu's decision to speak to Congress two weeks before the Israeli elections has "injected a degree of partisanship" that is "destructive of the fabric of the relationship." The White House was not consulted about the speech, which has been seen as a breach of protocol. President Obama has said he will not meet with Netanyahu during his visit to avoid influencing the Israeli elections. The episode has strained relations between Obama and Netanyahu, with top administration officials expressing their displeasure. Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Kerry will not attend the speech, and the White House has not committed to sending a representative to a conference where Netanyahu is also scheduled to appear.

END OF SUMMARY.
