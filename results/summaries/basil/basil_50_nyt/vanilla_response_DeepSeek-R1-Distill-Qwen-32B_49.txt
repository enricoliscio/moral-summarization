Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Susan Rice criticizing Netanyahu's speech to Congress. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points. 

First, Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, criticized Netanyahu for his plan to speak to Congress. She said his actions have hurt the US-Israel relationship. The speech is two weeks before the Israeli elections, which she thinks is too partisan and bad for the relationship. 

Netanyahu is speaking without consulting the White House, which the administration sees as a breach of protocol. Obama won't meet with him during the visit to avoid influencing the elections. This is a low point in Obama and Netanyahu's relationship. 

Rice's comments are the strongest rebuke yet from the Obama administration. They mentioned that the speech is causing partisanship, which weakens the relationship. The White House supports Rice's assessment. 

Netanyahu is going because he wants to prevent a nuclear deal with Iran. He turned down a meeting with Democrats, saying it might create more partisanship. 

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and covers all these points clearly. I should structure it by mentioning Rice's criticism, the reason (partisanship), Netanyahu's purpose (prevent Iran deal), the breach of protocol, Obama's refusal to meet, and the impact on the US-Israel relationship. Also, include that this is a low point in their relationship and the administration's support for Rice's stance.

Let me check the word count as I draft it. Make sure each sentence is concise and covers each key point without going into too much detail. Also, ensure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

I think I have all the main points. Now, I'll put it together in a clear, concise manner, making sure it's under 200 words.
