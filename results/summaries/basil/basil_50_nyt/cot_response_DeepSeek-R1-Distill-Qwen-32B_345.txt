Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Susan Rice criticizing Netanyahu's speech to Congress. The user wants me to identify all the morally framed words first, then write a summary preserving those frames.

First, I'll read through the article carefully to spot any words that carry a moral judgment. Words like "criticized," "hurt," "partisanship," "destructive," "controversy," "damaged," "breach of protocol," "displeasure," "weakens," "disappointing," "misperception," "obligation," "prevent," "final brake," "unquestionably strong," "immutable," "hard," and "maintain." These all seem to carry some moral weight in the context of the article.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and reflect the moral framing. I'll start by mentioning Rice's criticism, the impact on US-Israel relations, Netanyahu's speech plans, the breach of protocol, the administration's disapproval, and the broader implications of partisanship affecting the relationship.

I should ensure that the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too verbose. I'll make sure to include the main actors, their actions, and the consequences as framed morally in the article. I'll also highlight the administration's efforts to maintain a strong relationship despite the issues.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all morally framed words are appropriately included without making the summary sound forced.

**SUMMARY:**  
Susan E. Rice, President Obama’s national security adviser, criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel for his plans to address Congress, stating his actions had hurt the U.S.-Israel relationship. Rice accused Netanyahu’s speech, scheduled before the Israeli elections, of injecting partisanship, which she called destructive. The speech, arranged without consulting the White House, was seen as a breach of protocol. Obama’s administration expressed displeasure, with the president refusing to meet Netanyahu to avoid influencing the elections. Rice emphasized the need to keep the relationship strong and immutable, regardless of political seasons. Netanyahu defended his decision, claiming it was his obligation to prevent a nuclear deal with Iran. However, his refusal to meet with Democratic senators was disappointing, as it could compound the perception of partisanship. Rice avoided ascribing motives to Netanyahu but stressed the importance of maintaining a strong, bipartisan relationship between the two nations. END OF SUMMARY.
