SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice has strongly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address a joint meeting of Congress, saying his actions have "hurt" the relationship between the US and Israel. Rice stated that Netanyahu's decision to travel to Washington two weeks before the Israeli elections has "injected a degree of partisanship" that is "destructive of the fabric of the relationship." The Obama administration has viewed the move as a "breach of protocol" since it was arranged without consulting the White House. Rice's comments marked the strongest public rebuke to date, acknowledging that the controversy has "damaged" US-Israeli relations. The White House has also expressed displeasure, with Press Secretary Josh Earnest stating that allowing the relationship to be subjected to party politics "does weaken the relationship." Netanyahu's refusal to meet with Democratic senators has been met with disappointment, and his obligation to "do everything I can to prevent" a nuclear agreement with Iran has been seen as a partisan move.

END OF SUMMARY.
