SUMMARY:

Susan E. Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to address a joint meeting of Congress, saying it has "injected a degree of partisanship" and is "destructive of the fabric of the relationship" between the US and Israel. The speech, scheduled for March 3, was arranged without consulting the White House, which has called it a breach of protocol. The Obama administration has expressed displeasure over the episode, which has damaged US-Israeli relations. The White House has said it agrees with Rice's assessment, and President Obama will not meet with Netanyahu during his visit to avoid influencing the Israeli elections. The controversy has led to a low point in the tense relationship between Obama and Netanyahu.
