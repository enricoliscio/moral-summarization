SUMMARY:

US National Security Adviser Susan Rice has strongly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to address a joint meeting of Congress, saying it has injected partisanship and damaged the US-Israel relationship. Rice's comments are the strongest public rebuke by the Obama administration since Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Speaker John Boehner to speak against a nuclear deal with Iran. The speech, scheduled for March 3, was arranged without consulting the White House, which has called it a breach of protocol. The White House has said that President Obama agrees with Rice's assessment and will not meet with Netanyahu during his visit to avoid influencing the Israeli elections. The episode has touched off weeks of sniping and finger-pointing between the Obama and Netanyahu administrations.

END OF SUMMARY.
