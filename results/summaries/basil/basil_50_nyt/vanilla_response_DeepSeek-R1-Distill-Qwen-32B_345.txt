Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Susan Rice criticizing Netanyahu's decision to address Congress. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

First, Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, is criticizing Netanyahu for his plan to speak before Congress. She says his actions have hurt the US-Israel relationship. She mentions that his speech is adding partisanship, which is destructive. The speech is scheduled for March 3, arranged by Boehner and the Israeli ambassador without consulting the White House, which they see as a breach of protocol.

Obama won't meet with Netanyahu during his visit to avoid influencing the elections. The White House supports Rice's comments, with Obama agreeing and the press secretary saying her statements are consistent with his concerns. They don't want the relationship to be weakened by party politics.

Netanyahu is going to speak because he wants to prevent a nuclear deal with Iran, believing Congress is the last check before the agreement. He turned down a meeting with Democratic senators, saying it might create a perception of partisanship. Rice avoids guessing his motives but emphasizes the importance of a strong, bipartisan US-Israel relationship.

So, the main points are: Rice's criticism, the breach of protocol, Obama's stance, Netanyahu's reasons, and the potential damage to the relationship. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the specified tokens.
