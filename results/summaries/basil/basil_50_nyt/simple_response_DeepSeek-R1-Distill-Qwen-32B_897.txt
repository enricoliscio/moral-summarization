Okay, so the user has given me a news article about Susan Rice criticizing Netanyahu for his planned speech in Congress. They want a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Hmm, I need to make sure I capture the key points without losing the tone or the underlying message.

First, I should read through the article carefully. Susan Rice is the national security adviser, and she's criticizing Netanyahu for his speech. She says it's causing partisanship and harming the US-Israel relationship. The speech is before the elections, which is seen as a breach of protocol. The White House is upset because they weren't consulted, and Obama won't meet Netanyahu to avoid appearing partisan.

I need to highlight the main issues: the partisanship, the breach of protocol, the White House's response, and the impact on the relationship. Also, mention that top officials support Rice's stance and that Netanyahu's refusal to meet Democrats is seen as disappointing.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Rice's criticism, then explain why, mention the protocol breach, the White House's actions, and the broader implications for the relationship. Make sure to include Netanyahu's reasons and the Democratic response.

Wait, the user mentioned preserving the moral framing. So I should emphasize how the actions are affecting the relationship negatively, using words like "harm," "breach," "displeasure," etc. Also, note the administration's commitment to a strong, bipartisan relationship.

I think that's all. Now, I'll structure the summary, making sure it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Susan E. Rice, President Obama’s national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his plan to address Congress, stating his actions have introduced partisanship and harmed the U.S.-Israel relationship. Rice described Netanyahu’s decision to speak before the Israeli elections as “destructive,” marking the strongest public rebuke from the Obama administration. The speech, arranged without consulting the White House, was seen as a breach of protocol. Obama has declined to meet Netanyahu during his visit to avoid appearing to influence the elections. Rice emphasized the need to keep the U.S.-Israel relationship strong and bipartisan, unaffected by political seasons. Netanyahu defended his decision, saying it was his duty to prevent a nuclear deal with Iran. Democratic senators, who invited Netanyahu for a private meeting to balance the partisan optics, were disappointed by his refusal. Rice declined to speculate on Netanyahu’s motives but stressed the importance of maintaining an immutable U.S.-Israel relationship. The episode reflects growing tensions between Obama and Netanyahu, with administration officials openly expressing their displeasure.  
END OF SUMMARY.
