SUMMARY: President Obama's national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address Congress about Iran's nuclear program. Rice stated that Netanyahu's actions have hurt US-Israeli relations and injected partisanship. The speech, arranged without the White House's knowledge, has caused tension between Obama and Netanyahu, with the former refusing to meet Netanyahu during his visit. Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Kerry also have conflicting schedules. Netanyahu defended his trip, saying he must do everything to prevent a nuclear agreement with Iran. Rice emphasized the importance of a strong and apolitical US-Israeli relationship and expressed disappointment in Netanyahu's actions.
