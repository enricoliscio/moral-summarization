SUMMARY: Susan E. Rice, President Obamaâ€™s national security adviser, issued a strong rebuke of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address Congress regarding the potential nuclear deal with Iran. Rice argued that Netanyahu's actions have damaged US-Israeli relations by injecting partisanship into the relationship. The speech, arranged without consulting the White House, has caused tension between Obama and Netanyahu, leading to sniping and finger-pointing. Obama has said he will not meet with Netanyahu during his visit. Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Kerry will also not be present for the speech. Rice emphasized the importance of a strong and apolitical relationship between the two countries and expressed disappointment in Netanyahu's actions. Netanyahu defended his decision, stating that it was his obligation to prevent a nuclear agreement with Iran. The White House, however, believes that Netanyahu's actions weaken the relationship between the US and Israel.
