Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, criticizing Netanyahu for his plan to speak before Congress. She says his actions have hurt the US-Israel relationship. The speech is before the Israeli elections, and she feels it's injecting partisanship, which is destructive. The White House didn't consult on the speech, calling it a breach of protocol. Obama won't meet Netanyahu to avoid influencing the elections. The administration is upset, and Rice's comments are the strongest yet. They believe the relationship is being weakened by political involvement. Netanyahu is refusing to meet with Democrats, which is seen as disappointing. He claims he's speaking to prevent a nuclear deal with Iran. Rice avoids speculating on Netanyahu's motives but emphasizes the importance of a strong, bipartisan US-Israel relationship.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no more than 200 words, preserving the moral framing. The moral framing here is about the negative impact of partisanship on the US-Israel relationship. I need to highlight how Netanyahu's speech is seen as partisanship, the administration's criticism, and the potential weakening of the relationship.

I should structure the summary to include:
- Rice's criticism and its impact on the relationship.
- Netanyahu's reasons for the speech and the administration's response.
- The refusal to meet with Democrats and the administration's stance on maintaining a strong, bipartisan relationship.

I need to make sure the summary is concise and captures the moral aspect of partisanship harming the relationship. Let me draft it, keeping it under 200 words and ensuring it flows logically.

SUMMARY: Susan E. Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his plan to address Congress, arguing his actions have harmed U.S.-Israel relations. Rice stated that Netanyahu's decision to speak before the Israeli elections introduced partisanship, weakening the bilateral relationship. The speech, arranged without consulting the White House, was seen as a breach of protocol. Obama has declined to meet Netanyahu during his visit to avoid influencing the elections. The administration views the episode as a low point in their tense relationship, with Rice emphasizing the need for a strong, bipartisan U.S.-Israel partnership. Netanyahu, however, insists his speech aims to prevent a nuclear deal with Iran. Rice refrained from speculating on Netanyahu's motives but stressed the importance of maintaining an "unquestionably strong" relationship. END OF SUMMARY.
