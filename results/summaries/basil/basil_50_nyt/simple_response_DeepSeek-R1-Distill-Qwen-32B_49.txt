Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Susan Rice criticizing Netanyahu's decision to speak before Congress before the Israeli elections. She says it's causing partisanship and harming US-Israel relations. The White House is upset because they weren't consulted, and Obama won't meet Netanyahu during his visit. The administration is showing their displeasure openly. Netanyahu is focused on stopping the Iran nuclear deal, and he's refusing to meet with Democrats, which some see as avoiding partisanship. Rice emphasizes the importance of a strong, non-partisan relationship between the two countries.

So, the moral framing here is about the importance of maintaining a strong, non-partisan relationship despite political differences. I need to capture that in the summary. I should highlight Rice's criticism, Netanyahu's actions, the impact on relations, and the administration's stance on avoiding partisanship. I'll keep it under 200 words and end with the required tokens.
