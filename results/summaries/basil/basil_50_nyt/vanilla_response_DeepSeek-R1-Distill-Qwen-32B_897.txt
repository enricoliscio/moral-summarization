Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Susan Rice criticizing Netanyahu. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, is criticizing Netanyahu for his plan to speak to Congress. She says his actions have hurt the US-Israel relationship. The speech is scheduled two weeks before the Israeli elections, which is causing some political issues. The White House wasn't consulted about this, which they see as a breach of protocol. Obama won't meet with Netanyahu during his visit to avoid influencing the elections.

The article mentions that this is a low point in Obama and Netanyahu's relationship. There's been a lot of behind-the-scenes criticism from the administration. Rice's comments are the strongest public rebuke so far. The White House supports her stance, saying they don't want the relationship to be affected by party politics.

Netanyahu is going to speak because he wants to prevent a nuclear deal with Iran. He turned down a meeting with Democrats, which some see as disappointing. The article also mentions that other high-ranking officials like Biden and Kerry are not attending the speech or the AIPAC conference.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Rice's criticism, the reason for Netanyahu's speech, the protocol breach, Obama's refusal to meet, the impact on US-Israel relations, and the administration's support for Rice's stance.

Let me structure this: Start with Rice's criticism, mention the speech's timing and purpose, the protocol issue, Obama's response, Netanyahu's refusal to meet Democrats, and the administration's concern about partisanship affecting the relationship.

I should make sure the summary is clear and concise, hitting all the main points without getting too detailed.
