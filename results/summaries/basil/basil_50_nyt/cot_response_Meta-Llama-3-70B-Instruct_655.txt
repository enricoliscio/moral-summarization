SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice has sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address a joint meeting of Congress, saying his actions have "injected a degree of partisanship" that is "unfortunate" and "destructive" to the US-Israel relationship. Rice's comments are the strongest public rebuke to date by the Obama administration since Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Speaker John A. Boehner to make his case against a nuclear deal with Iran. The controversy has damaged US-Israeli relations, with top administration officials hinting at their "displeasure" over the breach of protocol. The White House has said that allowing the relationship to be "subjected to party politics" does "weaken" it. The episode is a low point in the tense relationship between Obama and Netanyahu, with both sides engaging in "sniping" and "finger-pointing". END OF SUMMARY.
