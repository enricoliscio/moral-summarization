SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address a joint meeting of Congress, saying it has "injected a degree of partisanship" and hurt the US-Israel relationship. Rice's comments are the strongest public rebuke by the Obama administration since Netanyahu accepted the invitation from Speaker John A. Boehner without consulting the White House. The speech, scheduled for March 3, has sparked controversy and damaged US-Israeli relations. The White House has said President Obama agrees with Rice's assessment and will not meet with Netanyahu during his visit to avoid influencing the Israeli elections. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Secretary of State John Kerry will also not attend the speech. Netanyahu has turned down a request for a private meeting with Democratic senators, citing concerns about partisanship.

END OF SUMMARY.
