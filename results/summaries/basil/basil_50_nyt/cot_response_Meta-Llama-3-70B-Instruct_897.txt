SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to address Congress, calling it "unfortunate" and "destructive" to the US-Israel relationship. The move was seen as a "breach of protocol" since it was arranged without consulting the White House. Rice's comments marked the strongest public rebuke to date by the Obama administration, acknowledging that the controversy has "weaken"ed US-Israeli relations. The episode is a low point in the tense relationship between Obama and Netanyahu, with top administration officials expressing their "displeasure" in recent days. Netanyahu's refusal to meet with Democratic senators was deemed "disappointing" by Senator Richard J. Durbin. The White House has not committed to sending a representative to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's conference, where Netanyahu is scheduled to appear. END OF SUMMARY.
