SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address Congress, saying his actions have "injected a degree of partisanship, which is not only unfortunate, I think it's destructive of the fabric of the relationship" between the US and Israel. The controversy has damaged US-Israeli relations, with the White House calling the arrangement a "breach of protocol". The episode marks a low point in the tense relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu, with top administration officials expressing their displeasure. Rice warned that "allowing this relationship to be subjected to party politics does weaken the relationship". The White House has not committed to sending a representative to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's conference, where Netanyahu is also scheduled to appear. Netanyahu's refusal to meet with Democratic senators has been deemed "disappointing" by Senator Richard J. Durbin. END OF SUMMARY.
