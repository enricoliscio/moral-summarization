Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Susan Rice criticized Netanyahu for his speech plans, saying it's hurt the US-Israel relationship. She mentioned partisanship and a breach of protocol. Netanyahu's actions have damaged the relationship, and the White House is upset because they weren't consulted. The speech is seen as injecting partisanship and being destructive. The White House is avoiding meetings to prevent the appearance of influencing the elections. Netanyahu refused a meeting with Democrats, which is disappointing. The article also mentions the nuclear deal with Iran as a priority for Obama.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary, using the moral words: actions, hurt, injected, destructive, damaged, breach, refusal, misperception, obligation, address.

I'll start by stating Rice's criticism and how it hurt the relationship. Then mention the partisanship and breach of protocol. Include the refusal to meet and Netanyahu's obligation to address the issue. Make sure to keep it under 200 words and include the key points without getting too detailed.

I should structure it so each sentence includes one or more of the moral words, ensuring the summary reflects the original's moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Susan E. Rice, President Obama’s national security adviser, criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel for his plans to address Congress, stating his actions have hurt the US-Israel relationship. She accused him of injecting partisanship, which she called destructive to the bilateral fabric. Netanyahu’s decision to speak before the Israeli elections, without consulting the White House, was seen as a breach of protocol. The speech, arranged by Speaker Boehner and the Israeli ambassador, has damaged the relationship, with Obama refusing to meet Netanyahu during his visit to avoid influencing the elections. Rice emphasized the need for the relationship to remain strong, regardless of political seasons. Netanyahu’s refusal to meet with Democratic senators was disappointing, as it could compound the misperception of partisanship. He justified his visit as an obligation to address the nuclear deal with Iran, which he aims to prevent. Rice avoided ascribing motives to Netanyahu but stressed the importance of maintaining an immutable relationship. END OF SUMMARY.
