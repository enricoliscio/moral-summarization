SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to address a joint meeting of Congress, saying his actions have "hurt" the relationship between the US and Israel. Rice stated that Netanyahu's move has "injected a degree of partisanship" that is "destructive of the fabric of the relationship." The controversy has "damaged" US-Israeli relations, with the White House calling the arrangement a "breach of protocol." President Obama has said he will not meet with Netanyahu during his visit to avoid any appearance of influencing the Israeli elections. The episode has touched off weeks of sniping and finger-pointing, with top administration officials expressing their displeasure. Netanyahu's "refusal" to meet with Democratic senators has been met with disappointment. Rice emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong and immutable relationship between the US and Israel, regardless of political seasons or party affiliations. END OF SUMMARY.
