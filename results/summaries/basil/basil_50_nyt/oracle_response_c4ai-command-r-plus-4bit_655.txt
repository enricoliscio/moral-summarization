SUMMARY: Susan E. Rice, President Obamaâ€™s national security adviser, criticized Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, for his plans to address Congress regarding the Iran nuclear deal. Rice stated that Netanyahu's actions have hurt US-Israeli relations and injected partisanship into the relationship. The speech, arranged without consulting the White House, was seen as a breach of protocol. Obama has refused to meet with Netanyahu during his visit, and top administration officials have expressed their displeasure. Netanyahu has also refused a request from Democratic senators for a private meeting, which has disappointed those who have supported Israel. Rice emphasized the importance of a strong and apolitical relationship between the two countries. Netanyahu defended his decision, stating that it was his obligation to prevent a nuclear agreement with Iran.
