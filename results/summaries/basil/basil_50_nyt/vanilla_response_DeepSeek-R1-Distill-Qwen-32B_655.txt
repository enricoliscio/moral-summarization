Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, criticizing Netanyahu for his plans to speak before Congress. She says his actions have hurt the US-Israel relationship. The speech is before the Israeli elections, which she thinks is causing partisanship.

Netanyahu accepted Boehner's invitation without consulting the White House, which they see as a protocol breach. Obama won't meet him to avoid influencing the elections. This is a low point in Obama-Netanyahu relations, with both sides sniping.

Rice's comments are the strongest rebuke from the Obama admin. The White House supports her, saying it's consistent with Obama's concerns. Other officials like Biden and Kerry are avoiding the speech. Netanyahu refused a meeting with Democrats, saying it might look partisan.

Netanyahu defends his trip as necessary to prevent a nuclear deal with Iran. Rice avoids guessing his motives but emphasizes the importance of a strong, non-partisan US-Israel relationship.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting key points: Rice's criticism, Netanyahu's speech causing partisanship, protocol breach, Obama's refusal to meet, administration's disapproval, Netanyahu's refusal to meet Democrats, his reasons, and Rice's emphasis on a strong relationship.
