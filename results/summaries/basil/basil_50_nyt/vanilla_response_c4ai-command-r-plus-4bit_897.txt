SUMMARY: Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his plans to address Congress about Iran's nuclear deal. Rice said Netanyahu's actions had hurt US-Israeli relations and injected partisanship. The speech was arranged without consulting the White House, and Obama has said he will not meet with Netanyahu to avoid influencing the upcoming Israeli elections. The controversy has led to sniping and finger-pointing between the two leaders. Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Kerry will also not attend Netanyahu's speech. Netanyahu has said the trip is necessary to prevent a nuclear agreement with Iran. Rice wants the US-Israeli relationship to be strong and immutable, regardless of political parties in power.
END OF SUMMARY.
