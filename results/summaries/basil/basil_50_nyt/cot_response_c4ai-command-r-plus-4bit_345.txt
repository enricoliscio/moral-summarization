SUMMARY:
Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, delivered a sharp criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address Congress regarding a potential nuclear deal with Iran. The controversy surrounding the invitation from Speaker Boehner, accepted without consulting the White House, has injected partisanship into the US-Israel relationship, which Rice described as "destructive". Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Kerry will also not attend the address. Netanyahu refused a private meeting with Democratic senators, stating that such a meeting could reinforce the perception of partisanship. The White House has expressed displeasure over Netanyahu's actions, highlighting the low point in the already tense relationship between Obama and Netanyahu. Rice emphasized the importance of an unquestionably strong and apolitical relationship between the two nations.
END OF SUMMARY.
