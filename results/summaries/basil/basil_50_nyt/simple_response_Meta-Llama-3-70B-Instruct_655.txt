SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for planning to address a joint meeting of Congress, saying it has "injected a degree of partisanship" and is "destructive of the fabric of the relationship" between the US and Israel. The speech, scheduled for March 3, was arranged without consulting the White House, a move seen as a breach of protocol. Rice's comments marked the strongest public rebuke to date by the Obama administration, acknowledging the controversy has damaged US-Israeli relations. The White House has said President Obama agrees with Rice's assessment, and has raised similar concerns. The episode has touched off weeks of sniping and finger-pointing, with top administration officials expressing displeasure. The controversy has highlighted the tense relationship between Obama and Netanyahu, with the White House accusing Netanyahu of politicizing the relationship.
