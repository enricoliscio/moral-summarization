SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice has strongly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address a joint meeting of Congress, stating that his actions have "injected a degree of partisanship" that is "destructive of the fabric of the relationship" between the US and Israel. Rice's comments are the strongest public rebuke to date by the Obama administration since Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Speaker John A. Boehner to make his case to Congress against a nuclear deal with Iran. The controversy has damaged US-Israeli relations, with the White House calling the move a breach of protocol. The episode marks a low point in the tense relationship between Obama and Netanyahu, with both sides engaging in anonymous sniping and finger-pointing. Rice emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong, bipartisan relationship between the two nations, regardless of political seasons or party affiliations.

END OF SUMMARY.
