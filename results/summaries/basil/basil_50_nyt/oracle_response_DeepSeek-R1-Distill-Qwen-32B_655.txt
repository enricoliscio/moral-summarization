Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. 

Susan Rice criticizes Netanyahu for addressing Congress, saying his actions hurt the US-Israel relationship. She mentions partisanship and destructiveness. The speech was arranged without consulting the White House, which is a breach of protocol. Obama won't meet him to avoid influencing the elections. The administration is upset, and Rice's comments are the strongest yet. They emphasize that the relationship is being weakened by party politics. Netanyahu refused a meeting with Democrats, adding to the perception of partisanship. He claims his obligation is to prevent a nuclear deal with Iran. Rice avoids guessing his motives but stresses the importance of a strong, bipartisan relationship.

I need to include the morally framed words: actions, hurt, injected, destructive, damaged, breach, refusal, misperception, obligation, address. I'll structure the summary to highlight the key points while using these words where appropriate.

First, mention Rice's criticism and how Netanyahu's actions hurt the relationship. Then, note the partisanship and destructiveness. Include the breach of protocol and the refusal to meet. Highlight the obligation to prevent the nuclear deal. Conclude with the administration's focus on a strong, bipartisan relationship.

Let me draft this, making sure to stay within 200 words and include all the necessary moral terms.

The speech, arranged without consulting the White House, was seen as a breach of protocol. Obama has refused to meet Netanyahu during his visit to avoid influencing the Israeli elections.
