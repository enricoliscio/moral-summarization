SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address a joint meeting of Congress, saying it has injected partisanship and hurt the US-Israel relationship. Rice's comments are the strongest public rebuke by the Obama administration since Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Speaker John A. Boehner without consulting the White House. The White House has called the move a breach of protocol, and President Obama will not meet with Netanyahu during his visit to avoid influencing the Israeli elections. The episode has touched off weeks of sniping and finger-pointing between the two leaders. Top administration officials have expressed displeasure, with Rice saying that allowing the relationship to be subjected to party politics weakens it. The White House has also not committed to sending a representative to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's conference, where Netanyahu is scheduled to appear.

END OF SUMMARY.
