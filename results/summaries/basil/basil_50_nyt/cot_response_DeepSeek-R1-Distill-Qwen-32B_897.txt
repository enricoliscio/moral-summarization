Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary with moral framing. They provided a detailed news article about Susan Rice criticizing Netanyahu's speech to Congress. 

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral implications. Words like "criticized," "hurt," "partisanship," "destructive," "damaged," "protocol," "displeasure," "weakens," "disappointing," "obligation," "prevent," "strong," "immutable," "hard," "maintain." These words show the emotional and moral stance of the parties involved.

Next, I have to summarize the article, keeping those moral words. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Rice's criticism, mention the damage to US-Israel relations, Netanyahu's reasons, and the administration's response. I'll include the refusal of meetings and the overall impact on the relationship. I'll end with Rice's emphasis on a strong, unbiased relationship.

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes all key points without losing the moral framing. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Also, I'll structure it clearly, starting with the main criticism, then the context, responses, and the administration's stance.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together, making sure each step is followed and the summary accurately reflects the moral elements from the article.

**SUMMARY:**  
Susan E. Rice, President Obama’s national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his plan to address Congress, stating his actions had hurt U.S.-Israel relations. Rice called the decision to speak before the Israeli elections "partisan" and "destructive," marking a significant public rebuke from the Obama administration. The speech, arranged without consulting the White House, was seen as a breach of protocol. Obama would not meet Netanyahu during his visit to avoid influencing the elections, and top officials expressed displeasure. Rice emphasized the importance of maintaining an "unquestionably strong" and "immutable" relationship between the U.S. and Israel, regardless of political seasons. Netanyahu defended his decision, saying he aimed to prevent a nuclear deal with Iran. However, his refusal to meet with Democratic senators was seen as disappointing. Rice avoided speculating on Netanyahu’s motives, focusing instead on preserving the relationship. The episode highlights the strain between Obama and Netanyahu, with the administration working to protect the partnership from partisan divides.
