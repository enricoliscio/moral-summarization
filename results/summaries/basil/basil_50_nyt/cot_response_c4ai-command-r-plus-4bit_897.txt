SUMMARY:
Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, *criticized* Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his upcoming address to Congress, calling it a "destructive" move that has injected "partisanship" into the US-Israel relationship. The controversy surrounding Netanyahu's acceptance of Speaker Boehner's invitation, made without consulting the White House, has sparked anonymous sniping and open *displeasure* from top US officials. Netanyahu refused a private meeting with Democratic senators, citing concerns about *misperception* of partisanship. Rice *rebuked* Netanyahu's actions as detrimental to the "unquestionably strong [and] *immutable*" relationship between the US and Israel. The White House agreed with Rice's assessment, stating that allowing partisanship to weaken the relationship is destructive. Netanyahu defended his trip, stating his *obligation* to "prevent" a nuclear deal with Iran. This episode highlights the tense relationship between Obama and Netanyahu, with the White House taking steps to avoid any appearance of influencing the upcoming Israeli elections.
