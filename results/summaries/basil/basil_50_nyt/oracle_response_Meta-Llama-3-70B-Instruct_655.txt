SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice has sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to address Congress, saying his actions have "hurt" the relationship between the US and Israel. Rice believes Netanyahu's move has "injected a degree of partisanship" that is "destructive of the fabric of the relationship." The controversy has "damaged" US-Israeli relations, with the White House calling the arrangement a "breach of protocol." President Obama has said he will not meet with Netanyahu during his visit to avoid influencing the Israeli elections. Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Kerry will also be absent, and the White House has not committed to sending a representative to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's conference. Netanyahu's "refusal" to meet with Democratic senators has been met with disappointment. Rice emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong, bipartisan relationship between the two countries, citing the "obligation" to address concerns about a nuclear deal with Iran. END OF SUMMARY.
