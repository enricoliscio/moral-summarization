SUMMARY:
Susan E. Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, *criticized* Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his plans to address Congress about Iran's nuclear deal. The invitation, extended by Speaker John A. Boehner and the Israeli ambassador without consulting the White House, has been seen as a *breach* of protocol and has *disappointed* Democratic senators. Rice *rebuked* Netanyahu, stating that his actions have injected *partisanship* and are *destructive* to the US-Israeli relationship. The controversy has sparked anonymous sniping and administration officials expressing their *displeasure*. Netanyahu defended his trip, stating his obligation to prevent a nuclear agreement with Iran. Rice emphasized the importance of an unquestionably strong and immutable relationship between the US and Israel, transcending political seasons.
