Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, criticizing Netanyahu for his plan to speak to Congress. She says his actions have hurt the US-Israel relationship by introducing partisanship. The speech is scheduled before the Israeli elections, which is seen as a breach of protocol because it wasn't coordinated with the White House. Obama won't meet Netanyahu during his visit to avoid influencing the elections. The administration is upset because this is a low point in their tense relationship, and they've been openly showing displeasure. Rice's comments are the strongest rebuke so far, and Obama agrees with her. The White House isn't sending anyone to Netanyahu's other events, and he's refused a private meeting with Democrats, which they see as disappointing. Netanyahu defends his actions as necessary to prevent a nuclear deal with Iran.

Now, I need to capture the moral framing. The article presents the US administration's perspective that Netanyahu's actions are harmful to the relationship, introducing partisanship and breaking protocol. The moral issue here is about maintaining a strong, bipartisan relationship despite political differences. The US is emphasizing the importance of not letting political divides weaken the alliance.

I should make sure the summary includes these elements: Rice's criticism, the partisanship issue, the breach of protocol, Obama's refusal to meet, the administration's displeasure, Netanyahu's refusal to meet Democrats, and his defense. I need to keep it under 200 words and end with the required tokens.

Let me structure it: start with Rice's criticism, mention the partisanship and protocol breach, Obama's stance, administration's reaction, Netanyahu's refusal, and his reasoning. Ensure the moral aspect is clear through the emphasis on the relationship's strength regardless of politics.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, keeping it concise and within the word limit.
