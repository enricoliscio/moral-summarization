SUMMARY: Susan E. Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, strongly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his plans to address Congress regarding a potential nuclear deal with Iran. Rice argued that Netanyahu's actions have damaged the relationship between the US and Israel by injecting partisanship. She emphasized the importance of keeping the relationship above party politics. The speech, arranged without the White House's knowledge, has caused a diplomatic row and led to anonymous sniping between the two leaders. Obama has said he will not meet with Netanyahu during his visit. Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Kerry have also indicated they will not be present for the speech. Netanyahu has defended his decision, stating that it is his obligation to prevent a nuclear agreement with Iran. Rice expressed a desire to maintain a strong and apolitical relationship between the two countries.
