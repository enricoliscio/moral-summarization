SUMMARY: Susan E. Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his plans to address Congress regarding a potential nuclear deal with Iran. Rice stated that Netanyahu's actions have damaged the relationship between the US and Israel by injecting partisanship into the relationship. The speech, arranged without consulting the White House, has led to a low point in the already tense relationship between Obama and Netanyahu, with both sides engaging in sniping and finger-pointing. Rice's comments are the strongest public rebuke by the Obama administration and acknowledge the damage to US-Israeli relations. The White House has indicated its displeasure by not committing to sending a representative to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's conference, which Netanyahu is also attending. Netanyahu has refused a private meeting with Democratic senators, further straining relations. Rice emphasized the importance of a strong and apolitical relationship between the two countries and expressed the administration's commitment to maintaining it.
