SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address Congress, saying his actions have "injected a degree of partisanship" that is "unfortunate" and "destructive of the fabric of the relationship" between the US and Israel. The controversy has damaged US-Israeli relations, with the White House calling the speech a "breach of protocol". Rice's comments marked the strongest public rebuke to date by the Obama administration. The episode is a "low point" in the tense relationship between Obama and Netanyahu, with top administration officials expressing their "displeasure" and hinting at the "sniping" and "finger-pointing" that has ensued. The White House has emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong and "immutable" relationship between the two countries, regardless of political seasons. END OF SUMMARY.
