SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to address Congress, saying it has "injected a degree of partisanship" that is "unfortunate" and "destructive" to the US-Israel relationship. The speech, scheduled for March 3, was arranged without consulting the White House, a "breach of protocol" that has sparked weeks of "sniping" and "finger-pointing". The Obama administration has expressed "displeasure" over the move, with Rice saying it "weakens" the relationship between the two countries. Netanyahu's refusal to meet with Democratic senators has been deemed "disappointing" by Senator Richard J. Durbin. The controversy has damaged US-Israeli relations, with the White House calling for a strong and "immutable" relationship that transcends political seasons. END OF SUMMARY.
