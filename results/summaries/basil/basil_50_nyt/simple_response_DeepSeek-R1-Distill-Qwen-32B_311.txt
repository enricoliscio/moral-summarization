Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the underlying moral stance.

First, Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, criticizes Netanyahu for addressing Congress before the Israeli elections. She says his actions have injected partisanship and damaged the US-Israel relationship. That's a strong rebuke from the administration. The article mentions that the speech was arranged without consulting the White House, which they see as a breach of protocol. Obama won't meet Netanyahu to avoid influencing the elections, which shows a clear stance against mixing politics with foreign relations.

The article also notes that top officials are openly displeased, and the White House supports Rice's comments. Netanyahu refused a meeting with Democrats, fearing it might seem partisan. He claims his visit is to prevent a nuclear deal with Iran, but Rice avoids speculating on his motives, emphasizing the importance of a strong, bipartisan US-Israel relationship.

The moral framing here seems to be about the integrity of the US-Israel relationship and the dangers of partisanship affecting it. The article highlights the administration's concern that political involvement weakens diplomatic ties. So, the summary should reflect this concern and the criticism of Netanyahu's move as harmful to the relationship.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, keeping the moral perspective intact. I'll focus on the criticism, the partisanship issue, the breach of protocol, Netanyahu's refusal, and the administration's emphasis on maintaining a strong, non-partisan relationship.
