Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally charged words as possible. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points.

The article discusses Susan Rice's concerns about Netanyahu's speech to Congress. She mentions that the timing and the invitation have introduced partisanship, which is destructive to U.S.-Israel relations. She emphasizes that the relationship has always been bipartisan and should remain so. Obama is not meeting Netanyahu before the speech, calling it inappropriate. Boehner invited Netanyahu without White House approval, and some lawmakers oppose the speech, fearing it will strain international talks on Iran's nuclear plans. Leahy called it a "stunt."

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words: problem, invited, seek, sending, cause, strain, stunt. I should ensure these are included in the summary.

I'll start by stating Rice's view that Netanyahu's speech is destructive. Mention the invitation by Boehner without seeking White House approval. Highlight the partisanship as a problem, leading to strain. Note Obama's decision not to meet, the bipartisan nature, and Leahy's criticism as a stunt.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while including all the key points and moral terms.

SUMMARY: Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech before a joint session of Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. She argued that the invitation, issued by House Speaker John Boehner without seeking White House approval, introduced partisanship, which she described as "unfortunate" and "problematic." Rice emphasized that the relationship between the U.S. and Israel has historically been bipartisan and should remain so. Obama has declined to meet Netanyahu before the speech, deeming it "inappropriate" given the timing two weeks before Israeli elections. Lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, have opposed the speech, warning it could cause additional strain on international talks over Iran's nuclear plans. Leahy called the speech "a tawdry and high-handed stunt." END OF SUMMARY.
