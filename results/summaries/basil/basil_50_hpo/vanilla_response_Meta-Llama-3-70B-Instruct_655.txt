SUMMARY:

Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice argued that the invitation and acceptance of the speech, which was arranged without White House approval, has injected partisanship into the relationship, which has traditionally been bipartisan. Obama has also announced that he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of the speech, citing the proximity to Israeli elections. Several lawmakers have spoken out against the speech, warning that it could harm international talks on Iran's nuclear program. The controversy has sparked strong reactions, with Senator Patrick Leahy calling the speech a "tawdry and high-handed stunt".
