SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice has warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress will be "destructive” to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice argues that the invitation, extended by House Speaker John Boehner without White House approval, has injected partisanship into the traditionally bipartisan relationship between the two nations. This politicization of the relationship is a problem, as it undermines the fabric of the relationship and is not what Israel, the American people, or the U.S. government want. The controversy surrounding the speech has also drawn criticism from lawmakers, who fear it could harm international talks on Iran's nuclear program. President Obama has announced that he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of the speech, deeming it “inappropriate” given the proximity to Israeli elections.
