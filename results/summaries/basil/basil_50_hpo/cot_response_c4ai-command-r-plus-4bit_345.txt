SUMMARY:
Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming speech to Congress could be "destructive" to US-Israel relations. The invitation, extended by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, has injected partisanship into what has traditionally been a bipartisan relationship. The timing of the speech, just two weeks before Netanyahu's reelection, has been criticized as "inappropriate" and "a tawdry and high-handed stunt." Several lawmakers have expressed concern that the speech could undermine international talks on Iran's nuclear program. Obama has stated he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of the speech, and Rice emphasized the importance of keeping the US-Israel relationship above politics.
