SUMMARY: U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming speech to Congress as "destructive" to US-Israel relations. Rice argued that the invitation, issued by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, has injected partisanship into a relationship that has always been bipartisan. Obama has also stated he will not meet Netanyahu ahead of his speech, citing the proximity to Israeli elections. Some lawmakers have opposed the speech, believing it may harm international talks on Iran's nuclear program. Sen. Patrick Leahy called the speech a "stunt." This incident highlights the complex dynamics between the two countries and the potential consequences of political actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
