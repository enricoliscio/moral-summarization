Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, is talking about Netanyahu's speech to Congress. She says it's "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. She mentions that the timing of the invitation, two weeks before the Israeli elections, has introduced partisanship, which is bad for the relationship. She emphasizes that the relationship has always been bipartisan and should stay that way, which is what both Israel and the American people want. She's critical because politics are getting involved, which is problematic.

Obama won't meet with Netanyahu before the speech, calling it inappropriate because it's too close to the elections. Boehner invited Netanyahu without consulting the White House, which might have caused issues. Some lawmakers, like Sen. Leahy, are against the speech, thinking it could strain talks on Iran's nuclear plans. Leahy called it a "tawdry and high-handed stunt."

So, the key points are: Rice's criticism, the partisanship introduced, the impact on U.S.-Israel relations, Obama's decision not to meet, Boehner's unilateral invitation, and lawmakers' concerns about Iran talks.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral stance that partisanship is harmful and that the speech is seen negatively because it's causing political interference. Also, include the reactions from Obama and Leahy.

Let me structure this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start with Rice's criticism, mention the partisanship and its negative impact, Obama's decision, Boehner's action, and then the lawmakers' concerns. Make sure to include the quotes from Rice and Leahy to show the moral framing.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. The summary should flow logically, connecting each point smoothly.

SUMMARY:  
Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech before a joint session of Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice argued that the timing of the invitation, two weeks before Israel's elections, has introduced partisanship, which weakens the bipartisan foundation of the relationship. She emphasized that both Israel and the American people prefer a non-politicized relationship. Obama has declined to meet Netanyahu before the speech, deeming it inappropriate due to the proximity to the elections. House Speaker John Boehner extended the invitation without consulting the White House, sparking criticism. Lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, have condemned the speech, warning it could harm international efforts to address Iran's nuclear program. Leahy labeled it a "tawdry and high-handed stunt."
