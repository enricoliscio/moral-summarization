Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about Susan Rice's comments on Netanyahu's speech in front of Congress. She's the national security adviser under Obama, so her perspective is important. She mentions that the speech is "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. I should note that she's pointing out how the timing and partisanship are affecting the relationship.

She explains that the invitation from Boehner and Netanyahu's acceptance two weeks before the election has introduced partisanship. That's a key point because it's unusual for such a high-level political move. She emphasizes that the relationship has always been bipartisan and should remain that way. I should highlight that she's concerned about the political injection into what should be a non-partisan issue.

Obama's decision not to meet Netanyahu is also important. He's avoiding the meeting to keep it from being seen as inappropriate, especially so close to the elections. This shows the administration's stance on maintaining a neutral position.

Boehner invited Netanyahu without consulting the White House, which is another point to include. This unilateral action is causing concerns among lawmakers. Some, like Sen. Leahy, have criticized the speech as a political stunt that could strain international talks, particularly regarding Iran's nuclear program.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements: Rice's concerns, the partisanship issue, Obama's stance, Boehner's action, and the criticism from lawmakers. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with Rice's comments, moving to the implications, and ending with the broader concerns about international relations.

Also, I should use clear and straightforward language, avoiding any markdown as per the instructions. The summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as specified. Let me make sure I cover all the main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY:  
Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech before a joint session of Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice argued that the timing of the invitation, issued by House Speaker John Boehner two weeks before Israel's elections, has introduced partisanship into the relationship, which has historically been bipartisan. She emphasized the need to maintain a non-partisan approach to preserve the U.S.-Israel alliance. Obama has declined to meet Netanyahu before the speech, deeming it inappropriate given the proximity to the elections. Boehner invited Netanyahu without consulting the White House, sparking criticism from lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, who called the speech a "tawdry and high-handed stunt." Concerns have also been raised that the speech could strain international efforts to address Iran's nuclear program.
