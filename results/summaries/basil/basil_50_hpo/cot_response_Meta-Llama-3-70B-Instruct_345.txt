SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan Rice has warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress will be "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. The invitation, issued by House Speaker John Boehner without White House approval, has injected "partisanship" into the relationship, making it an "unfortunate" and "problem"-ridden situation. Rice emphasized the importance of maintaining a "bipartisan" approach, which is what Israel and the American people want. President Obama has also taken a stance, saying it would be "inappropriate" to meet with Netanyahu ahead of the speech, which is scheduled two weeks before the Israeli elections. The move has been criticized by lawmakers, with Sen. Patrick Leahy calling it a "tawdry and high-handed stunt" that could strain international talks on Iran's nuclear plans. END OF SUMMARY.
