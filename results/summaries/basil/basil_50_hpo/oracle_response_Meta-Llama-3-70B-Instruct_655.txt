SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice argued that the invitation and acceptance of the speech, made without White House approval, has injected "partisanship" into the relationship, causing a "problem". She emphasized that the relationship should remain "bipartisan", as it has historically been, and that both Israel and the American people want it that way. Obama has also refused to meet with Netanyahu ahead of the speech, deeming it "inappropriate" so close to the Israeli elections. Several lawmakers have spoken out against the speech, warning it could "cause" additional "strain" on international talks over Iran's nuclear plans. Senator Patrick Leahy went so far as to call the speech a "tawdry and high-handed stunt".
