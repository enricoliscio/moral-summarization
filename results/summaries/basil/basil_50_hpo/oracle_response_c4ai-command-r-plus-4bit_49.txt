SUMMARY: Susan Rice, Barack Obama's national security advisor, has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress as "destructive" to US-Israel relations. Rice argued that the invitation, issued by Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, has injected partisanship into the relationship, which is usually bipartisan. Obama has declined to meet Netanyahu ahead of his speech, citing inappropriateness so close to the Israeli elections. Several lawmakers have also spoken out against the speech, calling it a "stunt" that could cause strain on international talks about Iran's nuclear plans. This situation has caused a problem, as it has injected politics into a relationship that has always been kept apolitical.
END OF SUMMARY.
