Alright, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. First, I should understand the task clearly.

The user wants me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. The main goal is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing. They've given two steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing a summary using those words.

Starting with STEP 1, I need to find all single words that carry moral connotations. I'll go through the article and pick out words that express approval, disapproval, or have a value judgment. Words like "destructive," "unfortunate," "partisanship," "inappropriate," "stunt," and "strain" stand out as they carry moral weight.

Next, for the summary, I have to ensure it's concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of those moral words as possible. I'll structure the summary to highlight Susan Rice's concerns, the impact on U.S.-Israel relations, the political implications, and the criticism from lawmakers. I'll make sure each sentence reflects the moral framing without adding my own opinions.

I should also check the word count to stay within the limit. The summary needs to be clear and capture the essence of the article, focusing on the key points: Rice's statements, the partisanship issue, Obama's decision, Netanyahu's speech, and the potential strain on international talks.

Finally, I'll format the response as per the user's instructions, starting with STEP 1, listing each moral word, then providing the summary after the specified tokens. Making sure everything is accurate and meets the user's requirements is crucial.

**STEP 1:**

* destructive  
* unfortunate  
* partisanship  
* inappropriate  
* tawdry  
* high-handed  
* stunt  
* strain  

**SUMMARY:**  

Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech before a joint session of Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice emphasized that the timing of the invitation, two weeks before Israel's elections, injected "partisanship" into the relationship, which she deemed "unfortunate" and harmful. She stressed the importance of maintaining a bipartisan approach, as both the U.S. and Israel desire. Obama has declined to meet Netanyahu before the speech, deeming it "inappropriate" so close to the elections. The invitation, issued by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, has drawn criticism, with Sen. Patrick Leahy calling the speech a "tawdry and high-handed stunt." Concerns also arise that the speech could exacerbate tensions over Iran's nuclear talks.  

**END OF SUMMARY.**
