Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify all the morally framed words. Let me read through the article again.

Susan Rice uses words like "destructive," which implies something harmful. She mentions "partisanship," which is about politics dividing people. She also says it's "unfortunate," showing regret. She emphasizes that the relationship should remain "bipartisan," meaning non-partisan. She states that the American people "want it that way," indicating a desire for unity. She refers to the speech as a "problem" because of politics. Netanyahu's speech is called a "stunt," which is a negative term. The article mentions "strain" on international talks, showing tension. "Inappropriate" is used to describe Obama's decision not to meet Netanyahu. The speech is described as "tawdry," meaning shabby or disreputable, and "high-handed," which is arrogant. "Additional strain" shows more tension. The relationship's "fabric" is being damaged. The situation is "unfortunate," and the speech is "problematic."

Now, I need to summarize the article using these words. I should make sure the summary captures the moral concerns without being too long. I'll start by stating Rice's view, then mention the bipartisan tradition, Netanyahu's speech, the partisanship, and the negative impact. I'll include Obama's decision and Leahy's criticism. Finally, I'll note the potential strain on international talks. I need to keep it under 200 words and use the morally framed words where appropriate.

**SUMMARY:**

Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech before a joint session of Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice emphasized that the relationship has historically been "bipartisan" and warned that injecting "partisanship" into it is "unfortunate" and harmful. Netanyahu accepted the invitation from House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, and Obama has declined to meet with him before the speech, deeming it "inappropriate" so close to the Israeli elections. Several lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, have condemned the speech as a "tawdry and high-handed stunt," fearing it could add "strain" to international talks on Iran's nuclear program. Rice stressed the need to preserve the "fabric" of the U.S.-Israel relationship, warning that political "partisanship" risks damaging it. END OF SUMMARY.
