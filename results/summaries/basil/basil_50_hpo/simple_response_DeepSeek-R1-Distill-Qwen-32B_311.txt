Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Susan Rice's comments on Netanyahu's speech. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points and the tone.

Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, is critical of Netanyahu's planned speech before Congress. She thinks it's destructive to U.S.-Israel relations because it's becoming too partisan. She mentions that both sides have injected partisanship, which is unfortunate and destructive. She emphasizes that the relationship has always been bipartisan and should stay that way. She also notes that both Israel and the American people want it to remain bipartisan.

Obama won't meet with Netanyahu before the speech because it's two weeks before the Israeli elections, so he considers it inappropriate. Boehner invited Netanyahu without consulting the White House, which some lawmakers oppose, fearing it could strain talks on Iran's nuclear plans. Sen. Leahy called the speech a "tawdry and high-handed stunt."

So, the summary needs to capture Rice's concern about partisanship harming the relationship, Obama's decision not to meet, Boehner's unilateral invitation, and the opposition from lawmakers. Also, include Leahy's quote to highlight the criticism.

I should structure it to first mention Rice's warning, then the reasons she gives, Obama's response, Boehner's action, and the criticism from lawmakers. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is preservedâ€”emphasizing the negative impact of partisanship on the relationship and the inappropriate nature of the speech timing.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with Rice's warning, mention the partisanship, Obama not meeting, Boehner's invitation without consulting, and the opposition including Leahy's statement. Make sure it flows well and stays within the word limit.

I think that covers all the key points while maintaining the critical tone towards the speech's impact on relations. I'll make sure to include the essential elements without getting too detailed.
