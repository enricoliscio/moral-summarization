SUMMARY: Susan Rice, Barack Obama's national security adviser, has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to speak before Congress as "destructive" to US-Israel relations. The invitation, extended by House Speaker John Boehner without seeking approval from the White House, has injected a degree of partisanship into the relationship, which has traditionally been bipartisan. Obama has stated that he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech, citing the proximity to Israel's elections as inappropriate. Several US lawmakers have spoken out against the speech, foreseeing it as a problem that could cause strain on international talks about Iran's nuclear plans. Patrick Leahy, a senator, referred to the speech as a "stunt." This issue highlights the moral concerns of those involved, including the potential seeking of political advantage and the sending of a message that could cause strain in international relations.
END OF SUMMARY.
