SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warns that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress will be "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations, injecting partisanship into a traditionally bipartisan relationship. Rice emphasizes the importance of maintaining a non-partisan approach, which is in the best interest of both the U.S. and Israel. The controversy surrounding the speech is fueled by House Speaker John Boehner's decision to invite Netanyahu without consulting the White House, and President Obama's subsequent refusal to meet with Netanyahu ahead of the speech. The timing of the speech, just two weeks before Israeli elections, has also raised concerns among lawmakers, who fear it could compromise international talks on Iran's nuclear plans. Senator Patrick Leahy has denounced the speech as a "tawdry and high-handed stunt".
