SUMMARY:
Susan Rice, National Security Advisor to President Barack Obama, has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech in front of a joint session of Congress as "destructive" to US-Israel relations. The invitation, issued by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, has injected partisanship into a relationship that has always been bipartisan. This move is seen as *inappropriate*, especially as it comes just two weeks before the Israeli elections. Several US lawmakers have spoken out against the speech, with Senator Patrick Leahy calling it a *tawdry stunt*. The concern is that it could strain international talks on Iran's nuclear plans. Rice emphasized that both countries *want* the relationship to remain bipartisan and that injecting politics into the equation is problematic. 

END OF SUMMARY.
