Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided a specific structure for the response, including identifying morally framed words and then writing a concise summary. 

First, I need to understand what "morally framed" words mean. These are words that carry a judgment or imply a value, like "destructive," "unfortunate," or "inappropriate." I'll go through the article and pick out all such words.

Looking at the article, Susan Rice uses terms like "destructive," "unfortunate," and "partisanship." She emphasizes the bipartisan nature, which is a positive framing. Netanyahu's speech is called a "stunt," which is negative. The article also mentions "inappropriate" and "strain," which are negative terms. I'll list each of these.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes these words. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by stating Rice's concerns about Netanyahu's speech being destructive. Then mention the partisanship injected by the invitation. Highlight Rice's emphasis on the bipartisan relationship and the negative impact of politics. Note Obama's decision not to meet Netanyahu, the invitation without White House approval, and the potential strain on international talks. Finally, include Leahy's criticism of the speech as a stunt.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points while preserving the moral tone. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. 

Now, putting it all together, I'll list the morally framed words first, then craft the summary accordingly.

**SUMMARY:**  
Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech before a joint session of Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice emphasized that the invitation from House Speaker John Boehner, issued two weeks before Netanyahu's election, injected "partisanship" into the relationship, which she deemed "unfortunate" and harmful to the "bipartisan" nature of U.S.-Israel ties. Obama has declined to meet with Netanyahu before the speech, deeming it "inappropriate" given the timing of the Israeli elections. The speech has also drawn criticism from lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, who called it a "tawdry and high-handed stunt," and concerns that it could strain international talks on Iran's nuclear program.  

**END OF SUMMARY.**
