SUMMARY:
Susan Rice, President Barack Obama's national security adviser, warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned address to Congress could deal a "destructive" blow to US-Israel relations. Rice highlighted the "unfortunate" partisanship injected into the relationship by both sides, citing House Speaker John Boehner's invitation to Netanyahu, which was issued without White House approval and accepted just weeks before Israel's elections. The speech has sparked controversy, with some lawmakers criticizing it as a "tawdry and high-handed stunt" that could complicate international talks on Iran's nuclear program. President Obama himself has weighed in, deeming it "inappropriate" to meet Netanyahu so close to the Israeli elections. This incident marks a departure from the traditionally bipartisan nature of the US-Israel relationship, with Rice emphasizing the importance of keeping politics out of the equation.
