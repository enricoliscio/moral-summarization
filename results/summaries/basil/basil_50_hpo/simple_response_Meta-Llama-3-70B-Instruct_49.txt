SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warns that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress will be "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations, injecting partisanship into a traditionally bipartisan relationship. Rice emphasizes that the relationship should remain above politics, as desired by Israel, the American people, and the U.S. government. The controversy surrounding the speech has led to Obama's decision not to meet with Netanyahu ahead of the speech, citing its proximity to the Israeli elections. The invitation, extended by House Speaker John Boehner without White House approval, has drawn criticism from lawmakers who fear it could hinder international talks on Iran's nuclear plans. Senator Patrick Leahy has denounced the speech as a "tawdry and high-handed stunt". The moral framing of this issue highlights the importance of preserving the integrity and bipartisanship of the U.S.-Israel relationship, and the need for political leaders to prioritize the greater good over partisan interests.
