Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The article is about Susan Rice's comments on Netanyahu's speech in Congress. The key points are that Rice thinks the speech is destructive to U.S.-Israel relations because it's partisan. She mentions that both sides have injected partisanship, which is unfortunate and destructive. She emphasizes that the relationship has always been bipartisan and should remain so. Netanyahu accepted the invitation from Boehner without consulting the White House, which caused strain. Some lawmakers, like Leahy, called it a stunt. Obama won't meet with Netanyahu before the speech.

I need to include the morally framed words: problem, invited, seek, sending, cause, strain, stunt. I should structure the summary to highlight Rice's concerns about partisanship and the negative impact on the relationship. Also, mention Netanyahu's acceptance, the lack of consultation, and the criticism from Leahy. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me start by stating Rice's view on the speech being destructive. Then explain the partisanship injected by both sides. Mention the bipartisan nature and the problem of politics interfering. Include Netanyahu's acceptance, Boehner's invitation without seeking White House approval, causing strain. Finally, note Leahy's criticism as a stunt and Obama's decision not to meet. Make sure all moral words are included.

SUMMARY: Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech before a joint session of Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. She argued that the invitation from Speaker John Boehner and Netanyahu's acceptance two weeks before the Israeli elections injected partisanship, which is "unfortunate" and "destructive" to the relationship's fabric. Rice emphasized the need for bipartisanship, stating that both the U.S. and Israel want to avoid political interference. Netanyahu's acceptance of the invitation without consulting the White House caused strain, particularly as it coincides with the Israeli elections. Several lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, criticized the speech as a "tawdry and high-handed stunt," fearing it could harm international talks on Iran's nuclear plans. Obama has declined to meet with Netanyahu before the speech, deeming it "inappropriate" given the timing. END OF SUMMARY.
