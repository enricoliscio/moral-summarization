SUMMARY: Susan Rice, President Barack Obama's national security adviser, warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned address to Congress would harm the bipartisan nature of US-Israel relations. Rice's comments reflect a moral concern for maintaining a non-partisan approach to foreign relations, particularly regarding a close ally like Israel. By accepting an invitation from House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, Netanyahu has injected partisanship into the relationship. This is evidenced by the criticism from Democratic lawmakers like Senator Patrick Leahy, who called the speech a "stunt." Obama himself has refused to meet with Netanyahu, citing the proximity to the Israeli elections. The incident highlights the ethical dilemma of balancing respect for a foreign leader with the potential damage caused by politicizing international relations. It raises questions about the appropriate boundaries between politics and foreign policy, especially when dealing with sensitive issues like Iran's nuclear program. END OF SUMMARY.
