Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the specific morally framed words to include. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the main points.

Susan Rice is criticizing Netanyahu's speech invitation by Boehner, saying it's destructive to U.S.-Israel relations. She mentions partisanship and how it's unfortunate and problematic. Obama won't meet with Netanyahu before the speech, calling it inappropriate. Lawmakers are worried it'll strain talks on Iran's nuclear plans, and Leahy calls it a stunt.

Now, I need to make a summary using the words: problem, invited, seek, sending, cause, strain, stunt. I should structure it to include these terms naturally. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I'll start by stating Rice's criticism, mention the invitation by Boehner, the partisanship issue, and how it's a problem. Then note Obama's decision not to meet, the lawmakers' concerns about causing strain, and Leahy's term'stunt.' I'll ensure the flow is logical and all key points are covered without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech before a joint session of Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice noted that the invitation by Speaker John Boehner and Netanyahu's acceptance two weeks before the Israeli elections introduced "partisanship," which she deemed "unfortunate" and "problematic." She emphasized that the relationship has historically been bipartisan and should remain so, warning that injecting politics into it is "a problem." Obama has refused to meet with Netanyahu before the speech, deeming it "inappropriate" given the timing near the elections. Lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, have expressed concerns that the speech could "cause additional strain" on international talks over Iran's nuclear plans, with Leahy calling it "a tawdry and high-handed stunt."  
END OF SUMMARY.
