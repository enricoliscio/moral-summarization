SUMMARY: Susan Rice, President Barack Obama's national security adviser, has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming speech in front of a joint session of Congress as "destructive" to US-Israel relations. Rice stated that the invitation, issued by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, has injected partisanship into the relationship between the two countries. Obama has also stated that he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech, citing the proximity to the Israeli elections. Several US lawmakers have spoken out against the speech, arguing that it could strain international talks over Iran's nuclear program. Sen. Patrick Leahy called the speech "a tawdry and high-handed stunt." Rice emphasized the traditionally bipartisan nature of the US-Israel relationship and expressed a desire to keep it that way.
END OF SUMMARY.
