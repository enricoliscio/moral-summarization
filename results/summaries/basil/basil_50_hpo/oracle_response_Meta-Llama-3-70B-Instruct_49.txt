SUMMARY:

Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech in front of a joint session of Congress will be "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations, injecting a degree of partisanship that is "unfortunate" and a "problem". Rice emphasized the importance of maintaining a bipartisan relationship, which is what "Israel wants" and what the "American people want". Obama has declined to meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech, deeming it "inappropriate" given the proximity to the Israeli elections. The invitation, extended by House Speaker John Boehner without seeking White House approval, has sparked controversy, with some lawmakers arguing it could "cause" additional "strain" on international talks over Iran's nuclear plans. Senator Patrick Leahy went so far as to call the speech a "tawdry and high-handed stunt". The situation highlights the need for diplomacy and cooperation, rather than partisan maneuvering.
