SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice believes the speech has become politicized, which is "unfortunate" and "destructive" to the traditionally bipartisan relationship between the two countries. President Obama has also announced that he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of the speech, citing its proximity to the Israeli elections. The speech has sparked controversy, with several lawmakers speaking out against it, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, who called it a "tawdry and high-handed stunt". The invitation to Netanyahu was extended by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, which has added to the tensions.
