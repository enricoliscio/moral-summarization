SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice has expressed concerns that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech in front of a joint session of Congress will be "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice believes that the invitation and acceptance of the speech have injected a degree of partisanship, which is a "problem" that threatens the bipartisan nature of the relationship. She emphasizes that the relationship should remain bipartisan, as it has always been, and that politicizing it would be detrimental. President Obama has also taken a stance, deciding not to meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech, deeming it "inappropriate" given the proximity to the Israeli elections. The speech has been met with criticism from lawmakers, who argue it could "cause" additional "strain" on international talks over Iran's nuclear plans. Sen. Patrick Leahy has gone so far as to call the speech a "tawdry and high-handed stunt‚Äù. The controversy surrounding the speech has raised concerns about the potential damage to U.S.-Israel relations.
