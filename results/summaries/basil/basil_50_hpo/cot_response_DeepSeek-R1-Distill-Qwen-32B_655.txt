Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two steps: first, identifying all the morally framed single words, and then writing a concise summary using those words.

Starting with the first step, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "destructive," "unfortunate," "injected," "partisanship," "problem," "inappropriate," "tawdry," and "high-handed" stand out as they express judgment or criticism.

Next, I need to create a summary that includes these words. The summary should be under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: Susan Rice's criticism, Netanyahu's speech, the impact on U.S.-Israel relations, the bipartisan nature, Netanyahu's election timing, Obama's refusal to meet, and the lawmakers' concerns about Iran talks.

I'll structure the summary to include all the identified moral terms, ensuring it flows naturally and covers all essential aspects without exceeding the word limit. I'll make sure to highlight the negative implications of the speech as per the original text.

**STEP 1:**  
* Destructive  
* Unfortunate  
* Injected  
* Partisanship  
* Problem  
* Inappropriate  
* Tawdry  
* High-handed  

**SUMMARY:**  
Susan Rice, Barack Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech before a joint session of Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice emphasized that the timing of the speech, two weeks before Netanyahu's election, has introduced "partisanship," which she described as "unfortunate" and harmful to the bilateral relationship. She stressed the importance of maintaining a bipartisan approach, noting that both Israel and the American people prefer this. Obama has declined to meet with Netanyahu before the speech, deeming it "inappropriate" given the proximity to the Israeli elections. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, sparking criticism from lawmakers who fear the speech could strain international talks on Iran's nuclear program. Sen. Patrick Leahy called the speech a "tawdry and high-handed stunt."  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
