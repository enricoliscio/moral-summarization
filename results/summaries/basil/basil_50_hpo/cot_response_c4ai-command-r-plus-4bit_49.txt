SUMMARY:
Susan Rice, President Barack Obama's national security advisor, has warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming speech to a joint session of Congress will be "destructive" to US-Israel relations. This assertion comes amidst concerns that the invitation, issued by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, has injected partisanship into the relationship. Rice emphasizes the traditionally bipartisan nature of the relationship and asserts that politicizing the issue is problematic. Obama himself has declined to meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech, deeming it "inappropriate" so close to the Israeli elections. Some lawmakers have criticized Netanyahu's speech as a "tawdry and high-handed stunt," expressing fears that it could complicate international talks on Iran's nuclear program. This incident has sparked a debate about the appropriate boundaries of partisan politics in foreign relations.
