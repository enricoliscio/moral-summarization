SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech in front of a joint session of Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice argued that the invitation, extended by House Speaker John Boehner without seeking approval from the White House, has injected "partisanship" into the relationship, which is a "problem". She emphasized that the U.S.-Israel relationship has always been bipartisan and should remain so. Rice's concerns are shared by several lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, who called Netanyahu's speech a "tawdry and high-handed stunt". The speech is seen as a potential cause of additional "strain" on international talks over Iran's nuclear plans. President Obama has announced that he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech, deeming it "inappropriate" given the proximity to the Israeli elections.

END OF SUMMARY.
