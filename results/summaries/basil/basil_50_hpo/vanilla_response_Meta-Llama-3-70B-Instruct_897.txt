SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice stated that the invitation and acceptance of the speech two weeks before Israel's election has injected partisanship into the relationship, which has historically been bipartisan. President Barack Obama has also declined to meet with Netanyahu ahead of the speech, deeming it "inappropriate" so close to the Israeli elections. The speech has sparked controversy, with several lawmakers opposing it, citing concerns it could strain international talks on Iran's nuclear plans. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) labeled the speech a "tawdry and high-handed stunt". The speech was arranged by House Speaker John Boehner without White House approval, further fueling the partisan debate.
