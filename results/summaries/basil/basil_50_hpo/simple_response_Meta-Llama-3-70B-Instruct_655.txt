SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice argues that the invitation and acceptance of the speech have injected partisanship into the relationship, which has historically been bipartisan. This politicization of the relationship is a problem, as it undermines the trust and cooperation between the two nations. President Obama has also taken a stand, refusing to meet with Netanyahu ahead of the speech, citing its proximity to the Israeli elections. Several lawmakers have spoken out against the speech, warning that it could harm international talks on Iran's nuclear plans. The move is seen as a "tawdry and high-handed stunt" by some, highlighting the need to maintain a non-partisan approach to U.S.-Israel relations.
