SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warns that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress will be "destructive” to U.S.-Israel relations. The invitation, issued by Speaker John Boehner without White House approval, has injected partisanship into the relationship, which has historically been bipartisan. Rice emphasizes that this politicization is a problem, as it undermines the fabric of the relationship. President Obama has also taken a stand, refusing to meet with Netanyahu ahead of the speech, citing its proximity to the Israeli elections. Several lawmakers have expressed concerns that the speech could strain international talks on Iran's nuclear plans. Sen. Patrick Leahy has gone so far as to call the speech a “tawdry and high-handed stunt.” The moral takeaway is clear: political posturing and grandstanding can have serious consequences for international relations and global security.
