SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to a joint session of Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice believes the speech has become politicized, which is a problem, as the relationship between the two countries has always been bipartisan. President Barack Obama has also announced that he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of the speech, deeming it "inappropriate" given the proximity to Israeli elections. The speech was arranged by House Speaker John Boehner without White House approval, sparking controversy. Several lawmakers have expressed opposition to the speech, fearing it could hinder international talks on Iran's nuclear program. Senator Patrick Leahy has called the speech a "tawdry and high-handed stunt".
