Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user wants a concise summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Susan Rice is criticizing Netanyahu's speech invitation, saying it's destructive to U.S.-Israel relations. She mentions partisanship injected by the invitation and Netanyahu's acceptance before the elections. She emphasizes that the relationship has been bipartisan and should remain so.

The article also notes that Obama won't meet Netanyahu before the speech, calling it inappropriate. Boehner invited Netanyahu without White House approval, and some lawmakers oppose the speech, fearing it could strain Iran nuclear talks. Sen. Leahy called the speech a stunt.

I need to include all these elements but keep it brief. I'll structure the summary by stating Rice's criticism, the reason (partisanship), mention Obama's decision, Boehner's action, and the lawmakers' concerns. I'll also add Leahy's comment to highlight the opposition.

I should ensure the moral framing is clearâ€”Rice is concerned about partisanship harming the relationship, and others see the speech as a political move that could have negative consequences. I'll avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's under 200 words and flows naturally. I'll check for clarity and conciseness, ensuring all key points are covered without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY:  
Susan Rice, Barack Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech before a joint session of Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice argued that the invitation, issued by House Speaker John Boehner and accepted by Netanyahu two weeks before Israel's elections, injected partisanship into the relationship, which has historically been bipartisan. She emphasized the importance of maintaining a non-political alliance, stating that both the U.S. and Israel desire this. Obama has declined to meet Netanyahu before the speech, deeming it inappropriate given the proximity to the elections. Boehner invited Netanyahu without consulting the White House, sparking criticism from lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, who called the speech a "tawdry and high-handed stunt." The speech has raised concerns about its potential impact on international talks over Iran's nuclear program.
