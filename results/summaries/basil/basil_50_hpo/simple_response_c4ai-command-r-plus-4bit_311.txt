SUMMARY: Susan Rice, President Barack Obama's national security adviser, has denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned address in front of a joint session of Congress as a detrimental act of partisanship that threatens to destroy the bipartisan fabric of the U.S.-Israel relationship. Rice's comments emphasize the moral imperative of preserving a non-partisan stance in international relations, particularly regarding the sensitive topic of Israel-US relations. By injecting politics into the equation, Speaker John Boehner and Netanyahu himself, so close to the Israeli elections, have endangered the very foundation of their countries' longstanding partnership. This act has caused dismay and concern among many, including President Obama, who refuses to meet Netanyahu, and Senator Patrick Leahy, who condemns the stunt as a breach of diplomatic etiquette. This incident highlights the ethical dimensions of diplomacy, where respect for process and bipartisan unity are valued above partisan gain. 

END OF SUMMARY.
