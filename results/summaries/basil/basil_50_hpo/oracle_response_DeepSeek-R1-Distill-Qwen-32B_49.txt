Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about Susan Rice's comments on Netanyahu's speech in Congress. The task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user also listed specific morally framed words that need to be included: problem, invited, seek, sending, cause, strain, stunt.

First, I need to understand the article thoroughly. Susan Rice is criticizing Netanyahu's speech because it's causing partisanship, which she sees as destructive to U.S.-Israel relations. She mentions that the invitation by Boehner and Netanyahu's acceptance two weeks before the election injected politics into the relationship. She emphasizes that it's usually bipartisan and that politics are a problem. Obama won't meet with Netanyahu before the speech, calling it inappropriate. Some lawmakers oppose the speech, fearing it'll strain talks on Iran's nuclear plans. Sen. Leahy called it a "stunt."

Now, I need to create a summary that includes the morally framed words. I should make sure to use "problem," "invited," "seek," "sending," "cause," "strain," and "stunt." The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll start by mentioning Rice's criticism, then the invitation and Netanyahu's acceptance. Highlight that it's causing partisanship and is destructive. Mention Obama not meeting because it's inappropriate. Include Boehner inviting without seeking White House approval. Then, some lawmakers oppose it, fearing it'll cause strain. Finally, Leahy's comment about it being a stunt.

I should structure it to flow logically, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral words are included naturally. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each moral word is appropriately placed.

SUMMARY: Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech before a joint session of Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice argued that the invitation by Speaker John Boehner and Netanyahu's acceptance, two weeks before the Israeli elections, injected partisanship into the relationship, which she described as a "problem." She emphasized that the relationship has always been bipartisan and should remain so, warning that politics "infuse" it negatively. Obama has declined to meet Netanyahu before the speech, deeming it "inappropriate" given the timing. Boehner did not seek White House approval before sending the invitation, sparking concerns that the speech could cause "strain" in international talks on Iran's nuclear program. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, have opposed the speech, calling it a "tawdry and high-handed stunt." END OF SUMMARY.
