SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech in front of a joint session of Congress will be "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice argued that the invitation and acceptance of the speech have injected a degree of partisanship, which is "unfortunate" and "destructive" to the fabric of the relationship. She emphasized that the relationship should remain "bipartisan". President Barack Obama has also taken a stance, saying he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech, deeming it "inappropriate" to do so two weeks before the Israeli elections. Several lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, have spoken out against the speech, calling it a "tawdry and high-handed stunt" that could cause additional strain on international talks over Iran's nuclear plans. END OF SUMMARY.
