SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice believes the speech has become politicized, which could harm the traditionally bipartisan relationship between the two countries. The controversy surrounds the invitation extended by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, and Netanyahu's acceptance two weeks before the Israeli elections. President Barack Obama has announced that he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of the speech, deeming it "inappropriate". Several lawmakers have also spoken out against the speech, fearing it could hinder international talks on Iran's nuclear program. The speech has sparked criticism, with Senator Patrick Leahy calling it a "tawdry and high-handed stunt".
