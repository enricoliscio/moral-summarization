SUMMARY: Susan Rice, Barack Obama's national security adviser, has warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress could be "destructive" to US-Israel relations. Rice believes that the invitation, issued by Speaker John Boehner without seeking White House approval, has injected partisanship into the relationship, which is usually bipartisan. This move is causing a problem, as it may cause strain on international talks about Iran's nuclear plans. Obama has already stated that he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech, citing the inappropriate timing so close to the Israeli elections. Several lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, have criticized Netanyahu's speech as a "stunt." This situation has brought to light the potential consequences of actions that seek to cause partisan division.
