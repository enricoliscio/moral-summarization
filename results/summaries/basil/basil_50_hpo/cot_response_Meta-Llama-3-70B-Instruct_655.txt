SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan Rice has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech in front of a joint session of Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice argued that the invitation and acceptance have injected "partisanship" into the relationship, which is "unfortunate" and a "problem". She emphasized the importance of maintaining a "bipartisan" approach to the relationship. President Obama has also taken a stance, saying he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech, deeming it "inappropriate". The move has sparked criticism from lawmakers, with Sen. Patrick Leahy calling the speech a "tawdry and high-handed stunt". The controversy has raised concerns about the impact on international talks over Iran's nuclear plans. END OF SUMMARY.
