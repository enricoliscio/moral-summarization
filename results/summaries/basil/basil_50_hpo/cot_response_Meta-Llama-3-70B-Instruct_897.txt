SUMMARY:
Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech in front of a joint session of Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice argued that the speech has injected a degree of "partisanship" into the relationship, which is "unfortunate" and "destructive" to the fabric of the relationship. She emphasized the importance of maintaining a "bipartisan" approach to U.S.-Israel relations. President Obama has also expressed his disapproval, saying he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech, deeming it "inappropriate". Several lawmakers have spoken out against the speech, with Sen. Patrick Leahy calling it a "tawdry and high-handed stunt" that could cause additional strain on international talks over Iran's nuclear plans. END OF SUMMARY.
