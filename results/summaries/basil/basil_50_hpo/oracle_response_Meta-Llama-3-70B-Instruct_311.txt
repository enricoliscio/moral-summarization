SUMMARY:

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech in front of a joint session of Congress will be "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations, injecting a degree of partisanship that is a "problem" for the traditionally bipartisan relationship. Rice emphasized that the invitation by House Speaker John Boehner and Netanyahu's acceptance without seeking White House approval has caused the issue to become "infused with politics", which is a concern. President Obama has refused to meet with Netanyahu ahead of the speech, deeming it "inappropriate" given the proximity to Israeli elections. The speech has sparked criticism from lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, who called it a "tawdry and high-handed stunt” that could “cause additional strain” on international talks over Iran's nuclear plans.
