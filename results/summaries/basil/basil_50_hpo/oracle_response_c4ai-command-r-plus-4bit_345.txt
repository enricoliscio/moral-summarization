SUMMARY: Susan Rice, Barack Obama's national security adviser, believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech in front of Congress will cause a problem in U.S.-Israel relations. John Boehner invited Netanyahu without seeking the White House's approval, injecting partisanship into the relationship. Obama refuses to meet with Netanyahu before his speech, calling it inappropriate. Several lawmakers have criticized Netanyahu's speech as a stunt that could strain international talks on Iran's nuclear plans. This situation has caused a problem by injecting politics into the relationship, which has always been bipartisan.
END OF SUMMARY.
