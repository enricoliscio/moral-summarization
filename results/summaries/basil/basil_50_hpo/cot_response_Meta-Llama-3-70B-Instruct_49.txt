SUMMARY:
National Security Adviser Susan Rice has warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to a joint session of Congress will be "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. The invitation, issued by House Speaker John Boehner without White House approval, has injected "partisanship" into the relationship, which Rice deems "unfortunate" and "destructive" to the traditionally "bipartisan" ties. President Barack Obama has also refused to meet with Netanyahu, citing it would be "inappropriate" so close to the Israeli elections. Several lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, have spoken out against the speech, calling it a "tawdry and high-handed stunt" that could strain international talks on Iran's nuclear plans. END OF SUMMARY.
