SUMMARY: Susan Rice, President Barack Obama's national security adviser, has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming speech to Congress as "destructive" to US-Israel relations. Rice argued that the invitation, issued by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, has injected partisanship into a relationship that has always been bipartisan. Obama has declined to meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech, citing the proximity to Israel's elections. Several US lawmakers have also spoken out against the speech, expressing concerns about potential strain on international talks over Iran's nuclear program. Sen. Patrick Leahy characterized the speech as "a tawdry and high-handed stunt." This episode highlights the ongoing tensions between the Obama administration and Netanyahu's government, with potential implications for the future of US-Israel relations.
