SUMMARY: Susan Rice, President Barack Obama's national security adviser, has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming speech to Congress as "destructive" to US-Israel relations. Rice stated that the invitation, issued by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, has injected partisanship into a relationship that has always been bipartisan. Obama has declined to meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech, citing the proximity to the Israeli elections. Several US lawmakers have also spoken out against the speech, arguing it could strain international talks on Iran's nuclear program. Sen. Patrick Leahy called the speech "a tawdry and high-handed stunt." Rice's comments highlight concerns about the potential negative impact on the US-Israel relationship, which has traditionally been above partisan politics. END OF SUMMARY.
