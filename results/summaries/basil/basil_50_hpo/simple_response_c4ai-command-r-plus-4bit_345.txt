SUMMARY: Susan Rice, President Barack Obama's national security adviser, has denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned address to Congress as "destructive" to the longstanding bipartisan nature of the U.S.-Israel relationship. This criticism comes amidst controversy surrounding House Speaker John Boehner's invitation to Netanyahu, which was issued without consulting the White House, and Netanyahu's acceptance, just weeks before the Israeli elections. Obama himself has declined to meet with Netanyahu, citing the proximity to the elections as inappropriate. Several U.S. lawmakers have also expressed concerns that Netanyahu's speech could negatively impact ongoing international negotiations on Iran's nuclear program. The incident has injected partisanship into a relationship that has traditionally been bipartisan, with Senator Patrick Leahy describing the speech as "a tawdry and high-handed stunt." Rice emphasizes that both countries desire a bipartisan relationship, and the current politicization of the situation is problematic. END OF SUMMARY.
