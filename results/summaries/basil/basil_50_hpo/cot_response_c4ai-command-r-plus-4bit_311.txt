SUMMARY:
Susan Rice, Barack Obama's national security adviser, warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress could be "destructive" to US-Israel relations. The speech, accepted by Netanyahu just two weeks before Israel's election, has injected "partisanship" into the relationship, which has always been bipartisan. This move has been deemed "inappropriate" and "unfortunate" by some lawmakers, who believe it could strain international talks on Iran's nuclear plans. The invitation, extended by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, has been criticized as a "tawdry and high-handed stunt." Rice emphasized that the relationship between the two countries should remain bipartisan and that injecting politics into it is problematic. Obama has stated he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech, citing the inappropriate timing so close to the Israeli elections. END OF SUMMARY.
