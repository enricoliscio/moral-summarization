SUMMARY: U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming speech to Congress could be "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice criticized House Speaker John Boehner's invitation to Netanyahu, arguing that it has injected partisanship into a relationship that has always been bipartisan. Obama has also stated he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech, citing the proximity to Israel's elections. Some lawmakers have expressed concern that the speech could negatively impact international talks on Iran's nuclear program. Sen. Patrick Leahy called the speech "a tawdry and high-handed stunt." Rice's comments reflect a growing concern about the potential consequences of Netanyahu's address to Congress. END OF SUMMARY.
