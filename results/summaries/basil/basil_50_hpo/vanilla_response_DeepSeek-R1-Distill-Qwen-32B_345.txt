Alright, I need to summarize the given news article about Susan Rice's comments on Netanyahu's speech. Let me read through the article carefully.

Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, criticizes Netanyahu's planned speech before Congress. She thinks it's destructive to U.S.-Israel relations because it's causing partisanship. She mentions that both sides have become partisan, which is unfortunate and damaging. She emphasizes that the relationship has always been bipartisan and should remain so.

Obama won't meet Netanyahu before the speech, calling it inappropriate since it's two weeks before Israeli elections. Boehner invited Netanyahu without White House approval. Some lawmakers oppose the speech, fearing it could strain talks on Iran's nuclear plans. Sen. Leahy called it a "tawdry and high-handed stunt."

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Rice's criticism, the partisanship issue, the impact on relations, Obama's decision not to meet, Boehner's invitation without approval, and lawmakers' concerns, including Leahy's statement.

I'll structure it to start with Rice's criticism, mention the partisanship, Obama's response, Boehner's action, and the opposition from lawmakers. I'll make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.

Let me draft the summary:

Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, criticizes Netanyahu's speech before Congress, calling it destructive to U.S.-Israel relations due to partisanship. She emphasizes the need for a bipartisan relationship. Obama won't meet Netanyahu before the speech, deeming it inappropriate. Boehner invited Netanyahu without White House approval. Lawmakers, including Sen. Leahy, oppose the speech, fearing it could strain Iran nuclear talks.

Wait, that's too short. I need to include more details without exceeding 200 words.

Let me try again:

Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, criticized Netanyahu's planned speech before Congress, stating it could harm U.S.-Israel relations by introducing partisanship. She highlighted the importance of maintaining a bipartisan relationship. Obama has decided not to meet Netanyahu before the speech, calling it inappropriate given the proximity to Israeli elections. House Speaker Boehner invited Netanyahu without consulting the White House. Several lawmakers, including Sen. Leahy, oppose the speech, arguing it could complicate international talks on Iran's nuclear program.

That's better, but maybe I can make it more concise. Let me check the word count. It's about 100 words, so I can add more details.

Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, criticized Netanyahu's planned speech before Congress, stating it could harm U.S.-Israel relations by introducing partisanship. She emphasized that the relationship has always been bipartisan and should remain so. Obama has decided not to meet Netanyahu before the speech, calling it inappropriate given the proximity to Israeli elections. House Speaker Boehner invited Netanyahu without consulting the White House. Several lawmakers, including Sen. Leahy, oppose the speech, arguing it could complicate international talks on Iran's nuclear program and called it a "tawdry and high-handed stunt."

Yes, that's comprehensive and within the limit. I'll present it as the summary.
