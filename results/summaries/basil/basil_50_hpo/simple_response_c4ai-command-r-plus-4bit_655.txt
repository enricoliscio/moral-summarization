SUMMARY: Susan Rice, President Barack Obama's national security adviser, condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned address before a joint session of Congress as a "tawdry and high-handed stunt" that threatens to undermine the bipartisan fabric of US-Israel relations. Rice's remarks reflect a moral concern for preserving the integrity and unity of the relationship between the two nations, which has traditionally been above partisan politics. By accepting House Speaker John Boehner's invitation to speak, Netanyahu has allowed politics to infiltrate a sacred alliance, endangering the trust and cooperation that have long defined the bond between the US and Israel. This breach of protocol, occurring just weeks before the Israeli elections, is seen as a calculated move that jeopardizes the ongoing negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program and risks the stability of an entire region. Obama's refusal to meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech underscores the gravity of this ethical dilemma, sending a clear message that such manipulative tactics will not be tolerated. END OF SUMMARY.
