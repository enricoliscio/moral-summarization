Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, is criticizing Netanyahu's speech to Congress. She says it's destructive to U.S.-Israel relations because it's causing partisanship. She mentions that the invitation from Boehner and Netanyahu's acceptance two weeks before the election has introduced politics into the relationship, which is unfortunate and destructive. She emphasizes that the relationship has always been bipartisan and should stay that way, as both Israel and the American people want it that way. Obama won't meet Netanyahu before the speech, calling it inappropriate. Boehner invited Netanyahu without consulting the White House. Some lawmakers oppose the speech, fearing it will strain talks on Iran's nuclear plans. Sen. Leahy called it a "tawdry and high-handed stunt."

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight Rice's criticism, the impact on U.S.-Israel relations, the partisanship introduced, Obama's decision not to meet, Boehner's action without White House approval, and the lawmakers' concerns. Also, include Leahy's quote to show opposition.

I should structure it to flow logically: start with Rice's statement, mention the reason (partisanship), Obama's action, Boehner's invitation, the potential strain on relations, and the opposition from lawmakers. Make sure to keep the moral framing, like the destructiveness and the bipartisan nature.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll make sure each sentence is concise and captures the essence without unnecessary details. Also, ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.
