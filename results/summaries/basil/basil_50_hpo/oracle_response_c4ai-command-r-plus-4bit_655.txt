SUMMARY: Susan Rice, President Obama's national security advisor, has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming speech in front of a joint session of Congress as "destructive" to US-Israel relations. Rice argues that the invitation, issued by Speaker John Boehner without seeking approval from the White House, has injected partisanship into a relationship that has always been bipartisan. This is seen as a problem by both countries and the American people. Obama has stated that he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech, citing the inappropriate timing so close to the Israeli elections. Several lawmakers share the concern that Netanyahu's speech could cause strain on international talks about Iran's nuclear plans. Sen. Patrick Leahy called the speech "a tawdry and high-handed stunt." This situation highlights the moral concerns around the potential consequences of political actions, including the impact on international relations and the importance of maintaining a bipartisan approach to foreign policy.
