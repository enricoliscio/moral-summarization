Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Susan Rice's comments on Netanyahu's speech. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, says Netanyahu's speech to Congress is destructive to U.S.-Israel relations. She mentions that the timing and partisanship involved are causing issues. She emphasizes that the relationship has always been bipartisan and should stay that way.

Obama won't meet Netanyahu before the speech, calling it inappropriate so close to the elections. Boehner invited Netanyahu without checking with the White House first. Some lawmakers, like Sen. Leahy, are against the speech, fearing it will strain talks on Iran's nuclear plans.

So, the summary should include Rice's concerns about partisanship, the impact on the relationship, Obama's refusal to meet, Boehner's role, and the criticism from lawmakers. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

I should start with Rice's statement, mention the partisanship and its effect, then Obama's decision, Boehner's invitation, and end with the criticism and potential strain on Iran talks. Make sure to include key names and the main points without getting too detailed.

Let me put it all together in a clear, concise manner.

SUMMARY:  
Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech before a joint session of Congress, calling it "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations. Rice argued that the timing of the invitation, issued by House Speaker John Boehner two weeks before Israel's elections, introduced partisanship, which she believes undermines the bipartisan nature of the U.S.-Israel relationship. Obama has declined to meet with Netanyahu before the speech, deeming it inappropriate given the proximity to the Israeli elections. Boehner invited Netanyahu without consulting the White House, and several lawmakers, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, have condemned the speech, warning it could harm international efforts to address Iran's nuclear program.  
END OF SUMMARY.
