SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, arguing that the state's legalization of recreational marijuana has led to an influx of marijuana into their states, undermining their marijuana bans and straining their law enforcement resources. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's regulated marijuana shops are piping marijuana into neighboring states, creating a "dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system. The suit asks the US Supreme Court to strike down key parts of Colorado's 2012 voter-approved measure that legalized marijuana. Colorado's attorney general has dismissed the challenge as "without merit" and vowed to defend the state's laws. Marijuana advocates warn that shutting down marijuana retailers could boost the black market. The lawsuit targets the commercial side of marijuana legalization, but does not seek to overturn the portion of the law that made marijuana legal for personal use and possession.

END OF SUMMARY.
