SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalized marijuana is "flowing" into their states and "draining" their resources. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's regulations have "created a dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system, allowing marijuana to "come" into neighboring states and "stress" their criminal justice systems. Sheriffs in rural counties bordering Colorado have complained about the "influx" of marijuana, leading to more arrests, impounded vehicles, and higher jail and court costs. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, has vowed to "defend" against the lawsuit, calling it "without merit." Marijuana advocates warn that if the lawsuit "succeeds," it could "put" violent criminal organizations "in charge" of the marijuana trade. The lawsuit accuses Colorado officials of "ignoring" federal drug laws and "developing" a "scheme" to distribute marijuana. Colorado's rules are criticized for having "huge holes" that allow marijuana to "flow" out of state. END OF SUMMARY.
