Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. The user has provided a detailed article about a legal challenge against Colorado's marijuana laws by Nebraska and Oklahoma. My task is to create a concise summary, no more than 200 words, that captures the main points.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the key elements. The main points are:

1. Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado's marijuana laws in the Supreme Court.
2. They argue that Colorado's legal marijuana market is causing issues in their states, like increased arrests and costs.
3. Colorado's Attorney General is defending the laws, stating the lawsuit lacks merit.
4. The lawsuit focuses on the commercial aspects, not personal use, which might not be overturned even if the lawsuit succeeds.
5. Marijuana advocates warn that shutting down legal sales could boost the black market.
6. The lawsuit accuses Colorado of not properly regulating marijuana sales, making it easy for it to cross state lines.

I should structure the summary to include these points in a logical flow. Start with the states filing the lawsuit, their arguments, Colorado's response, the implications of the lawsuit, and the advocates' concerns.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary details. I'll keep each point brief, using key terms like "Supreme Court," "federal drug laws," "black market," etc.

Also, I should ensure that the summary doesn't exceed 200 words. I'll count the words after drafting to make sure it's within the limit.

Finally, I'll format the summary with "SUMMARY:" at the beginning and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end, as per the user's instructions.

SUMMARY:  
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court challenging Colorado's 2012 marijuana legalization law, arguing it creates a "dangerous gap" in federal drug control, leading to marijuana flowing into their states. They claim this influx has increased arrests, costs, and strain on their criminal justice systems. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, dismissed the lawsuit as "without merit," stating they will defend the law. The lawsuit targets Colorado's commercial marijuana system, including regulated stores and taxes, rather than personal use. Marijuana advocates warn that shutting down legal retailers could revive the black market. The states accuse Colorado of failing to track marijuana sales and enforce background checks, making it easy for illegal distribution. Colorado's laws allow anyone over 21 to purchase marijuana, with no requirement to consume it on-site. The lawsuit argues this violates federal drug laws and creates a patchwork of state policies. While some border law enforcement reports an increase in marijuana seizures, others say they haven't seen a significant rise.  

END OF SUMMARY.
