Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. 

The article is about Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a lawsuit against Colorado's marijuana legalization. They argue that Colorado's regulated system is causing marijuana to flow into their states, leading to problems like more arrests and higher costs. They're framing this as Colorado creating a dangerous gap in federal drug control. 

I need to identify the morally charged words first. Words like "challenge," "illegal," "outlawed," "dangerous gap," "undermining," "draining," "stress," "influx," "arrests," "impounded," "strain," "problem," "scheme," "violation," "patchwork," "pro-drug," "black market," "violent criminal organizations," "scheme," "ignoring," "objective," "federal drug control," "patchwork," "pro-drug," "black market," "violent criminal organizations," "scheme," "ignoring," "objective," "federal drug control," "patchwork," "pro-drug," "black market," "violent criminal organizations."

Now, for the summary. I need to include these moral terms while keeping it concise. I should mention the lawsuit, the states involved, their arguments about the impact on their states, and Colorado's defense. Also, include the marijuana advocates' perspective on the potential black market resurgence.

I'll structure it by stating the lawsuit, the reasons Nebraska and Oklahoma gave, the impact they claim, Colorado's response, and the advocates' concern. I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes the moral framing words identified.

**SUMMARY:**
Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit against Colorado's marijuana legalization, arguing it creates a "dangerous gap" in federal drug control, leading to marijuana flowing into their states. They claim this influx undermines their marijuana bans, drains treasuries, and stresses their criminal justice systems. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, dismissed the challenge as "without merit," stating they would "vigorously defend" their laws. The lawsuit targets Colorado's commercial marijuana system, not personal use. Marijuana advocates warn that shutting down retailers could revive the black market, putting "violent criminal organizations back in charge." Nebraska and Oklahoma accuse Colorado of ignoring federal drug laws and failing to track marijuana sales, allowing criminal enterprises to acquire inventory. The lawsuit highlights concerns about Colorado's lack of consumer background checks and tracking, contributing to the "significant influx" of marijuana in neighboring states. Colorado's border sheriffs report increased arrests and resource strain, though some dispute the impact.
