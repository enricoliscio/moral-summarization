SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma filed the first major court challenge to marijuana legalization on Thursday, asking the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down key parts of Colorado's voter-approved measure that legalized marijuana for adult use and created a system of stores, taxes, and regulations. The lawsuit argues that Colorado has created a dangerous gap in federal drug control, leading to increased arrests, impounded vehicles, and higher costs for neighboring states. Colorado's attorney general plans to defend against the lawsuit, stating that the challenge is without merit. The lawsuit is aimed at the commercial side of marijuana legalization and does not seek to overturn the portion of the law that made marijuana legal for personal use and possession. Marijuana advocates argue that shutting down retailers could boost the black market. Nebraska and Oklahoma's lawsuit accuses Colorado of participating in a scheme that violates federal drug control laws and creates a patchwork of pro-drug policies. The lawsuit was filed directly with the Supreme Court as it involves a dispute among states.
END OF SUMMARY.
