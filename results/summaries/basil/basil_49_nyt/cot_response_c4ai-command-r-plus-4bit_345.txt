SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a moral challenge to Colorado's marijuana legalization, arguing that it is a dangerous scheme that violates federal drug-control laws and drains their treasuries. They accuse Colorado of creating a patchwork of pro-drug policies that ignore the federal anti-drug regulation and permit the development of a dangerous gap in drug control. The lawsuit, brought by the attorneys general of Nebraska and Oklahoma, is aimed at the commercial side of marijuana legalization and seeks to shut down Colorado's system of regulations, taxes, and retail stores. It argues that Colorado has left huge holes in marijuana rules, allowing the plant to flow out of state and undermining their own marijuana bans. Colorado's attorney general has vowed to vigorously defend the legality of marijuana legalization, despite personally objecting to it. Marijuana advocates warn that if Nebraska and Oklahoma succeed, they will strengthen the illicit market and put criminal organizations back in charge. The dispute between these states raises questions about the morality of marijuana legalization and the impact of state policies on neighboring communities.
