SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, arguing that the state's legalization of recreational marijuana has led to a "dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system, resulting in marijuana flowing into their states and undermining their marijuana bans. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's regulated marijuana shops have created a commercial system that cultivates, packages, and distributes marijuana in violation of federal law. The suit alleges that Colorado's lack of regulation allows marijuana to flow out of state, leading to increased arrests, impounded vehicles, and higher jail and court costs in neighboring states. Colorado's attorney general has dismissed the challenge as "without merit" and vows to defend the state's marijuana laws. Marijuana advocates warn that shutting down retailers could boost the black market and put "violent criminal organizations back in charge."

END OF SUMMARY.
