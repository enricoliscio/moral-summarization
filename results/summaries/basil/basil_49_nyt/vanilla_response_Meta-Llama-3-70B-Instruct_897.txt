SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, arguing that the state's legalized marijuana is being transported into their states and undermining their drug laws. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's regulated marijuana shops are creating a "dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system, leading to more arrests, impounded vehicles, and higher jail and court costs in neighboring states. The lawsuit targets the commercial side of marijuana legalization, seeking to shut down recreational stores, dispensaries, and production facilities. Colorado's attorney general has vowed to defend the state's marijuana laws, while marijuana advocates warn that shutting down retailers could boost the black market. The lawsuit accuses Colorado officials of violating federal drug laws and ignoring the objective of the federal drug control regulation.

END OF SUMMARY.
