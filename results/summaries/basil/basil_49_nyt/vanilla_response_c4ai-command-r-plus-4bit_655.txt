SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed the first major legal challenge to marijuana legalization, asking the US Supreme Court to strike down key parts of Colorado's 2012 voter-approved measure that legalized marijuana for adult use and created a new system of regulations, taxes, and retail stores. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's legalization has led to an increase in marijuana flowing into neighboring states, undermining their own marijuana bans and causing increased costs for law enforcement and the criminal justice system. While some rural sheriffs and police officers in states bordering Colorado have expressed concern about increased marijuana entering their jurisdictions, other law enforcement officers have not observed a significant increase. Colorado's attorney general has vowed to vigorously defend the state's legalization measure, arguing that the challenge is without merit. The lawsuit is aimed at the commercial side of marijuana legalization and does not seek to overturn the portion of the law that made marijuana legal for personal use and possession. Marijuana advocates argue that shutting down retail stores could boost the black market. The lawsuit accuses Colorado of participating in a scheme that violates federal drug control laws and seeks to overturn the state's legalization measure.
END OF SUMMARY.
