SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalized marijuana is "flowing" into their states and "draining" their resources. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's regulations have "created a dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system, allowing marijuana to "come" into neighboring states and "stress" their criminal justice systems. The attorneys general of Nebraska and Oklahoma claim that the influx of marijuana has led to more arrests, impounded vehicles, and higher jail and court costs. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, has called the challenge "without merit" and vows to "defend" the state's laws. Marijuana advocates warn that if the lawsuit "succeeds," it could "put" violent criminal organizations "in charge" of the drug trade. The lawsuit accuses Colorado officials of "ignoring" federal drug laws and "developing" a "scheme" to cultivate and distribute marijuana. Colorado's rules are criticized for leaving "huge holes" that allow marijuana to flow out of state. END OF SUMMARY.
