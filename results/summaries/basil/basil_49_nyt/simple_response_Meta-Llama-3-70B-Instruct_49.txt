SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalized marijuana is causing problems in their states. They argue that Colorado's regulated marijuana shops are allowing the drug to flow into their states, undermining their own marijuana bans and causing increased arrests, impounded vehicles, and higher jail and court costs. The lawsuit targets the commercial side of marijuana legalization, seeking to shut down retailers and dispensaries. Colorado's attorney general has called the challenge "without merit" and vows to defend the state's laws. Marijuana advocates warn that if the lawsuit succeeds, it could boost the black market and put criminal organizations back in charge. The lawsuit accuses Colorado of violating federal drug control regulations and creating a "dangerous gap" in the system. Nebraska and Oklahoma claim that Colorado's rules have huge holes, allowing marijuana to flow out of state and enabling criminal enterprises to acquire inventory directly from retail stores.

END OF SUMMARY.
