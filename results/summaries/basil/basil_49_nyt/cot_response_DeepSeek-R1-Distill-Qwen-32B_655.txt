Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is asking for two main things: first, to identify all the single words that are morally framed, and second, to write a summary using those words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Nebraska and Oklahoma suing Colorado over its marijuana legalization, arguing that it's causing problems in their states. The moral framing here is likely around terms that carry a positive or negative connotation related to the issue.

For the first step, I need to pick out words that have a moral charge. Words like "challenge," "illegal," "gap," "undermining," "draining," "stress," "influx," "arrests," "impounded," "strain," "merit," "scheme," "violates," "pro-drug," "patchwork," "holes," "easily," "stock up," "track," "background checks," "criminal enterprises," "gangs," "cartels," "inventory," "sourced," "statistics," "increase." These words carry a negative or positive moral weight in the context of the article.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible without making it too long. The summary should reflect the moral stance presented in the article, which seems to be critical of Colorado's marijuana laws from Nebraska and Oklahoma's perspective.

I'll start by stating the lawsuit, then outline the main arguments: the gap in federal law, the flow of marijuana, the negative impacts on neighboring states, the lack of tracking and checks, and the potential for a black market if the lawsuit succeeds. I'll also mention Colorado's defense and the possible implications.

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally, using the identified morally framed words where appropriate. I should avoid making it too technical and keep it clear and concise.

Putting it all together, the summary should capture the essence of the legal challenge, the moral arguments presented by both sides, and the potential consequences. I'll make sure to include terms like "challenge," "illegal," "gap," "undermining," and others to reflect the moral framing accurately.

**SUMMARY:**  
Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit challenging Colorado’s marijuana legalization, arguing it creates a dangerous gap in federal drug laws, allowing marijuana to flow into their states. They claim this undermines their marijuana bans, drains their treasuries, and stresses their criminal justice systems. Sheriffs in border counties report increased arrests, impounded vehicles, and higher costs due to the influx of Colorado-sourced marijuana. Colorado’s attorney general, John Suthers, dismissed the challenge as without merit, stating they would defend the law. The lawsuit targets Colorado’s commercial marijuana system, including dispensaries and production facilities, while not challenging personal use. Marijuana advocates warn that shutting down legal retailers could revive the black market, benefiting criminal organizations. The lawsuit accuses Colorado of ignoring federal drug laws and failing to track marijuana sales or require background checks, making it easy for criminal enterprises to acquire marijuana. While Nebraska and Oklahoma complain about the influx, they did not provide specific statistics on Colorado-related arrests or seizures. Some law enforcement along Colorado’s borders say they have not seen an increase in marijuana from Colorado.
