SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, arguing that the state's legalization of recreational marijuana has led to a significant influx of marijuana into their states, undermining their own marijuana bans and causing a strain on their criminal justice systems. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's regulations have created a "dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system, allowing marijuana to flow into neighboring states and fueling criminal activity. The attorneys general of Nebraska and Oklahoma argue that Colorado's laws have led to more arrests, impounded vehicles, and higher jail and court costs. They claim that Colorado's lack of regulation, including not tracking marijuana sales and not requiring criminal background checks for buyers, has allowed criminal organizations to exploit the system. Colorado's attorney general has dismissed the lawsuit as "without merit," and marijuana advocates warn that shutting down retailers could boost the black market.

END OF SUMMARY.
