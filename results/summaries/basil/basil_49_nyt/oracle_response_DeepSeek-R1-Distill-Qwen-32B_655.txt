Okay, so the user has given me a task where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Nebraska and Oklahoma challenging Colorado's marijuana legalization in court. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary.

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. It's about two states suing Colorado because they claim Colorado's legal marijuana is causing problems in their states, like more arrests and strain on their systems. Colorado's attorney general is defending against the lawsuit, saying it's without merit. Marijuana advocates worry that if the lawsuit succeeds, it might boost the black market.

Now, I need to identify the morally charged words from the list provided. Words like "created," "flows," "draining," "stress," "coming," "problem," "defend," "succeed," "put," "charge," "ignoring," "development," "policies," "schemes," "found," "acquiring," "influx" are important to include.

I should structure the summary to include these words while keeping it concise, around 200 words. I'll start by stating that Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit, using "created" and "flows" to describe the impact. Then mention the draining of treasuries and stress on systems. Colorado's attorney general defends against this, and the lawsuit aims to shut down the commercial side, which could put the black market back in charge. The states accuse Colorado of ignoring federal laws and creating policies that allow marijuana to flow out. Finally, note that the lawsuit doesn't target personal use but focuses on commercial aspects, and Colorado's defense.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key moral points without being too technical. Also, the summary should end with the "END OF SUMMARY." token as instructed.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the morally framed words naturally.

SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit challenging Colorado's marijuana legalization, arguing it has created a dangerous gap in federal drug-control systems. They claim marijuana flows into their states, draining treasuries and placing stress on their criminal justice systems. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, defended the state, stating the challenge is without merit. The lawsuit accuses Colorado of ignoring federal drug laws and participating in a scheme that allows marijuana to be cultivated, packaged, and distributed, creating a patchwork of state policies. Nebraska and Oklahoma argue Colorado's rules enable criminal enterprises to acquire marijuana inventory, contributing to an influx in their states. Marijuana advocates warn that shutting down Colorado's legal market could put violent criminal organizations back in charge. The lawsuit does not target personal use but focuses on commercial aspects, leaving some portions of legalization intact even if the states succeed. END OF SUMMARY.
