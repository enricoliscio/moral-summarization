Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article is about Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a lawsuit against Colorado's marijuana legalization. They argue that Colorado's legal market is causing marijuana to flow into their states, leading to problems like increased arrests and financial strain on their systems. The lawsuit is asking the Supreme Court to strike down parts of Colorado's 2012 law. Colorado's attorney general is defending the law, saying it's without merit.

I need to make sure I include the morally framed words the author used: created, flows, draining, stress, coming, problem, defend, succeed, put, charge, ignoring, development, policies, schemes, found, acquiring, influx.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflict between the states, the impact on neighboring states, and the arguments from both sides. I'll use the moral terms to convey the negative impact Nebraska and Oklahoma perceive, and the positive defense from Colorado.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally. Let me start by outlining the key points: the lawsuit, the impact on neighboring states, Colorado's defense, the commercial aspect, and the potential consequences if the lawsuit succeeds.

Now, putting it all together, making sure to incorporate the moral framing words. I'll make sure each point is clear and the summary is balanced, presenting both sides but highlighting the moral aspects as per the user's request.

SUMMARY:  
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado's marijuana legalization, arguing that Colorado's regulated market has created a dangerous gap in federal drug-control systems, allowing marijuana to flow into their states. They claim this influx is draining their treasuries, placing stress on their criminal justice systems, and causing more arrests and law enforcement costs. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, defended the state's laws, stating the challenge is "without merit." The lawsuit focuses on the commercial side of marijuana legalization, aiming to shut down regulated retail stores, dispensaries, and production facilities, while not targeting personal use. Marijuana advocates warn that if the lawsuit succeeds, it could revive the black market, putting violent criminal organizations back in charge. Nebraska and Oklahoma accuse Colorado of ignoring federal drug laws and failing to track marijuana sales or require background checks for buyers, allowing criminal enterprises to acquire marijuana inventory. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's policies create a patchwork of state regulations that conflict with federal drug-control objectives. While some law enforcement officials report an influx of Colorado-sourced marijuana, others along Colorado's borders say they have not seen an increase. The case highlights the tension between state and federal marijuana policies.
