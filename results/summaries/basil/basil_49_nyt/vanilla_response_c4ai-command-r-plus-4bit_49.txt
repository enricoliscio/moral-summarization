SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, challenging the state's legalization of marijuana. The lawsuit, filed by the attorneys general of the two states, argues that Colorado's system of recreational marijuana shops has led to an increase in marijuana flowing into neighboring states, undermining their own marijuana bans and causing financial strain. The suit accuses Colorado of creating a dangerous gap in federal drug control and seeks to shut down the state's commercial marijuana industry. Colorado's attorney general has vowed to defend the state's legalization measure, known as Amendment 64, which was approved by voters in 2012. The lawsuit is aimed at the commercial side of marijuana legalization, including the system of regulations, taxes, and retail stores. Marijuana advocates argue that if the lawsuit succeeds, it could boost the black market for the drug. The suit was filed directly with the Supreme Court as it involves a dispute among states and accuses Colorado of violating federal drug control laws. Nebraska and Oklahoma claim that Colorado's lax regulations have led to an increase in marijuana-related arrests and costs in their states. However, some law enforcement officers along Colorado's borders have stated that they have not seen a significant increase in marijuana crossing state lines.
END OF SUMMARY.
