Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Colorado's marijuana laws being challenged by Nebraska and Oklahoma. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by saying that Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit against Colorado's marijuana legalization. They argue that Colorado's regulated shops are causing marijuana to flow into their states, which still ban it. The lawsuit is in the Supreme Court, targeting the 2012 Colorado law that legalized marijuana.

I should note that while marijuana is illegal federally, states like Colorado have their own programs. The plaintiffs claim Colorado has created a gap in federal drug control, leading to more marijuana in their states, increased arrests, and costs. They mention sheriffs seeing more marijuana since sales began in January.

Colorado's attorney general is defending the law, saying the challenge is without merit. The lawsuit focuses on the commercial aspects, not personal use, so even if they win, personal use might remain legal. Marijuana advocates worry this could boost the black market.

The lawsuit accuses Colorado of violating federal laws by allowing easy transport of marijuana, without tracking or background checks. They mention that Colorado doesn't require buyers to smoke or eat the product on-site, making it easy to transport.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll include the states involved, the reason for the lawsuit, the impact on neighboring states, Colorado's defense, and the potential implications if the lawsuit succeeds.

Let me structure this: Start with the lawsuit details, then the arguments from both sides, and the implications. Keep it clear and within the word limit.
