SUMMARY:
Two heartland states, Nebraska and Oklahoma, have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalized marijuana is creating a "dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system. They argue that marijuana is flowing into their states, "undermining" their bans and "draining" their treasuries. The lawsuit accuses Colorado of "ignoring" federal laws and participating in a "scheme" that cultivates and distributes marijuana. Colorado's attorney general has dismissed the challenge as "without merit." Marijuana advocates warn that shutting down retailers could boost the "violent criminal organizations" and create a "patchwork" of state and local pro-drug policies. The lawsuit highlights the "huge holes" in Colorado's marijuana rules, which allow the plant to flow out of state. END OF SUMMARY.
