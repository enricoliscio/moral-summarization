SUMMARY:
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, arguing that its recreational marijuana laws have created a "dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system, allowing marijuana to flow into neighboring states and "undermining" their marijuana bans. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's laws are "ignoring" federal regulations and creating a "patchwork" of state and local policies. The states argue that the influx of marijuana has led to more arrests, "draining" their treasuries, and placing "stress" on their criminal justice systems. Colorado's attorney general has called the challenge "without merit" and vows to "vigorously defend" the state's laws. Marijuana advocates warn that shutting down retailers could boost the "violent" black market. The lawsuit accuses Colorado officials of participating in a "scheme" that cultivates and distributes marijuana in direct violation of controlled-substances laws. END OF SUMMARY.
