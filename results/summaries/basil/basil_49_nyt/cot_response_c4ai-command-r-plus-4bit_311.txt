SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, challenging the legalization of marijuana. They argue that Colorado's system of state-regulated recreational marijuana shops is illegal under federal law and is draining their resources by increasing arrests and court costs. The lawsuit accuses Colorado of participating in a scheme that violates controlled substances laws and creates a dangerous gap in the federal drug control system. Nebraska and Oklahoma claim that this has led to a significant influx of marijuana into their states, straining their criminal justice systems. Colorado's Attorney General has opposed the lawsuit, stating that it is without merit and that the state will defend its marijuana legalization measures. The challenge is aimed at the commercial side of legalization, with Nebraska and Oklahoma accusing Colorado of ignoring federal drug control regulations and creating a patchwork of pro-drug policies. They criticize Colorado for not tracking marijuana sales or requiring background checks for buyers, which they say allows criminal enterprises and cartels to acquire marijuana easily. END OF SUMMARY.
