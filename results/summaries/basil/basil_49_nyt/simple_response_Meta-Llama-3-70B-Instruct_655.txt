SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, arguing that its legalized marijuana system is causing marijuana to flow into their states, undermining their bans and straining their law enforcement resources. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's regulated recreational marijuana shops are creating a "dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system, leading to more arrests, impounded vehicles, and higher jail and court costs. Colorado's attorney general has dismissed the challenge as "without merit" and vows to defend the state's marijuana laws. Marijuana advocates warn that shutting down retailers could boost the black market, putting "violent criminal organizations back in charge." The lawsuit targets the commercial side of legalization, accusing Colorado officials of violating federal drug laws. If successful, the lawsuit could shut down marijuana retailers, potentially harming the legal industry.

END OF SUMMARY.
