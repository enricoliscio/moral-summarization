SUMMARY:
Two heartland states, Nebraska and Oklahoma, have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, arguing that its recreational marijuana shops are creating a "dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system. They claim that marijuana is flowing into their states, "undermining" their bans and "draining" their treasuries. The lawsuit accuses Colorado of participating in a "scheme" that cultivates, packages, and distributes marijuana in direct violation of controlled-substances laws, "ignoring every objective" of federal drug control regulations. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, has called the challenge "without merit" and vowed to "vigorously defend" against the lawsuit. Marijuana advocates warn that if the lawsuit succeeds, it could boost the "violent criminal organizations" and create a "patchwork" of state and local pro-drug policies. END OF SUMMARY.
