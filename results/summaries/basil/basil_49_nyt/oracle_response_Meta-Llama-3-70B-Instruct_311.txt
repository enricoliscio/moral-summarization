SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, arguing that its legalized marijuana has "created a dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system, allowing marijuana to "flow" into neighboring states and "drain" their treasuries. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's regulations have led to a "stress" on their criminal justice systems, with more arrests, impounded vehicles, and higher jail and court costs. Sheriffs in rural counties bordering Colorado have complained about the "influx" of marijuana, which has become a "problem" for them. Colorado's attorney general has vowed to "defend" the state's marijuana laws, while marijuana advocates warn that shutting down retailers could "put" violent criminal organizations "in charge" again. The lawsuit accuses Colorado officials of "ignoring" federal drug laws and "developing" a "scheme" that cultivates and distributes marijuana. Nebraska and Oklahoma argue that the Constitution does not permit a "patchwork" of state and local pro-drug policies.
