Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a lawsuit against Colorado's marijuana legalization. They argue that Colorado's regulated marijuana shops are causing marijuana to flow into their states, which are still outlawing it. They mention issues like increased arrests, higher costs for law enforcement, and strain on their criminal justice systems. Colorado's attorney general defends the law, saying it's not the state's fault and that the lawsuit lacks merit.

I should make sure to highlight the moral arguments from both sides. Nebraska and Oklahoma are concerned about the negative impact on their states, while Colorado and marijuana advocates argue that regulating the market reduces the black market and is constitutional.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens. I should avoid any markdown and keep it concise, capturing the key points and moral perspectives.

Let me start by outlining the main points:

1. Nebraska and Oklahoma sue Colorado over marijuana legalization.
2. They claim it's causing marijuana to flow into their states, leading to more arrests and costs.
3. Colorado's attorney general defends the law, saying it's constitutional.
4. Advocates argue that shutting down legal sales would boost the black market.

Now, I'll structure the summary, making sure to include these points and the moral framing from both sides.

SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit challenging Colorado's marijuana legalization, arguing it creates a "dangerous gap" in federal drug laws, leading to increased marijuana flows into their states. They claim this has resulted in more arrests, higher law enforcement costs, and strains on their criminal justice systems. Colorado's attorney general defends the law, stating it is constitutional and not the state's responsibility. Marijuana advocates counter that shutting down legal dispensaries would revive the black market, putting criminal organizations in charge. The lawsuit focuses on Colorado's commercial marijuana operations, not personal use, and accuses the state of failing to track marijuana sales or conduct background checks, making it easy for illegal distribution. Colorado's defense highlights the legal framework's benefits, while opponents emphasize the negative externalities on neighboring states. END OF SUMMARY.
