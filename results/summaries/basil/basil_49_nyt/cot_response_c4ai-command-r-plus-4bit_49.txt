SUMMARY:
Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a *challenge* against Colorado's marijuana legalization, arguing that it has led to a *dangerous* *influx* of marijuana into their states, *undermining* their marijuana bans and *draining* their resources. They claim that Colorado's *scheme* of regulations and taxes has created a *gap* in federal drug control, allowing marijuana to be *prohibited* across state lines. Colorado's attorney general *accused* the *challenge* of being *without merit*, arguing that the state will *vigorously defend* its legalization laws. The *dispute* between the states centers on the commercial side of marijuana legalization, with Nebraska and Oklahoma arguing that Colorado has left *holes* in its regulations, allowing marijuana to *flow* out of state. They also *complained* about the *requirement* for criminal background checks and the lack of tracking for marijuana sales, which they believe *allows* *criminal* *enterprises*, *gangs*, and *cartels* to *acquire* marijuana *inventory*. While some bordering states have reported an *increase* in marijuana-related arrests and seizures, others have not noticed a significant change. The outcome of this *challenge* could have significant implications for the future of marijuana legalization in the United States.
