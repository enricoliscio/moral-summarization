SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, challenging the state's legalization of recreational marijuana. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's regulated marijuana shops are allowing marijuana to flow into neighboring states, undermining their marijuana bans and causing increased arrests, impounded vehicles, and higher jail and court costs. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's laws have created a "dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system, allowing marijuana to be transported across state lines. Colorado's attorney general has dismissed the lawsuit as "without merit" and vowed to defend the state's laws. If successful, the lawsuit could shut down marijuana retailers in Colorado, potentially boosting the black market. The lawsuit targets the commercial side of marijuana legalization, but does not seek to overturn the portion of the law that made marijuana legal for personal use and possession.

END OF SUMMARY.
