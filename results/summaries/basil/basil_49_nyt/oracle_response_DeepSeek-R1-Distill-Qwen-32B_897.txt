Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Nebraska and Oklahoma suing Colorado over marijuana legalization. They used specific morally charged words, so I need to make sure those are included in the summary.

First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points. Colorado legalized marijuana in 2012, and now Nebraska and Oklahoma are challenging this because they say it's causing problems in their states. They mention that marijuana is flowing into their states, which is draining their resources and putting stress on their criminal justice systems.

I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: created, flows, draining, stress, problem, defend, succeed, put, charge, ignoring, development, policies, schemes, found, acquiring, influx. I should incorporate as many of these as possible into the summary without making it too long.

The summary should be concise, around 200 words. I'll start by stating that Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit against Colorado's marijuana laws. Then mention the reasons: marijuana flows into their states, causing problems like more arrests and resource strain. Colorado's attorney general is defending the law, saying it's without merit. The lawsuit focuses on the commercial side, not personal use, and critics argue it could boost the black market. Finally, the states are accusing Colorado of ignoring federal laws and creating loopholes.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points with the moral language. I should avoid adding any personal opinions, just stick to the facts as presented in the article. Also, keep the language clear and straightforward, using the specified words to maintain the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit challenging Colorado's marijuana legalization, arguing it has "created a dangerous gap" in federal drug-control systems, allowing marijuana to "flow" into their states. They claim this influx is "draining" their treasuries, "placing stress" on their criminal justice systems, and causing more arrests and resource allocation for law enforcement. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, has vowed to "defend" the law, calling the challenge "without merit." The lawsuit targets the commercial side of marijuana legalization, accusing Colorado of ignoring federal drug laws and "ignoring" the "development" of state policies that facilitate marijuana distribution. Critics warn that if Nebraska and Oklahoma "succeed" in shutting down Colorado's regulated market, it could "put" criminal organizations "in charge" of the black market. The suit also accuses Colorado of failing to track marijuana sales and enforce background checks, making it easy for "criminal enterprises" to "acquire" marijuana. While the lawsuit focuses on commercial aspects, it does not seek to overturn personal use, leaving parts of Colorado's legalization intact. The states argue that Colorado's "scheme" undermines federal drug laws and creates an "influx" of marijuana, though specific statistics on Colorado-related arrests were not provided. END OF SUMMARY.
