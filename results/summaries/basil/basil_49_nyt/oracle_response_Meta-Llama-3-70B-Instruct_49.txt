SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalized marijuana has "created a dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system, allowing marijuana to "flow" into neighboring states. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's regulations have "drained" the treasuries and placed "stress" on the criminal justice systems of neighboring states. Sheriffs in rural counties bordering Colorado have complained of a "problem" with increased marijuana arrests, impounded vehicles, and higher jail and court costs. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, has vowed to "defend" against the lawsuit, which he claims is "without merit." Marijuana advocates warn that if the lawsuit "succeeds," it could "put" violent criminal organizations "in charge" of the black market. The lawsuit accuses Colorado officials of "ignoring" federal drug laws and "developing" a "scheme" to cultivate and distribute marijuana. Nebraska and Oklahoma claim that Colorado's rules have "found" ways to allow marijuana to flow out of state, and that the state is not tracking marijuana sales or requiring background checks on buyers.

END OF SUMMARY.
