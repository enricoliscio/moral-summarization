SUMMARY: Two heartland states, Nebraska and Oklahoma, filed a lawsuit against Colorado, challenging the legalization of marijuana. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's state-regulated recreational marijuana shops have led to an increase in marijuana flowing into neighboring states, undermining their own marijuana bans and causing financial and social costs. The challenge is aimed at the commercial side of marijuana legalization, arguing that Colorado's regulations have created a dangerous gap in federal drug control and allowed marijuana to be distributed across state lines. Nebraska and Oklahoma present concerns about the lack of tracking and background checks in Colorado's system, arguing that it enables criminal enterprises to acquire marijuana easily. While some bordering states have complained about an influx of Colorado-sourced marijuana, others have not observed a significant increase. Colorado's attorney general plans to defend against the lawsuit, stating that the challenge is without merit. Marijuana advocates also argue that shutting down retailers could boost the black market and empower criminal organizations. The lawsuit has been filed directly with the Supreme Court due to the interstate dispute.

END OF SUMMARY.
