SUMMARY: Two heartland states, Nebraska and Oklahoma, have filed a lawsuit challenging Colorado's marijuana legalization, arguing that it is "ignoring" federal drug control laws and "draining" their resources. The lawsuit accuses Colorado of creating a dangerous gap in federal drug control, with marijuana flowing into neighboring states and undermining their bans. Law enforcement in bordering states claim to have seen an increase in marijuana from Colorado, leading to more arrests and higher costs. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, vowed to "defend" against the challenge, arguing it is without merit. The lawsuit, filed directly with the Supreme Court, targets the commercial side of legalization and seeks to shut down the state-regulated recreational marijuana shops. Nebraska and Oklahoma argue that Colorado is participating in a scheme that cultivates and distributes marijuana in violation of federal laws, and that it is leaving holes in marijuana rules that allow the plant to flow out of state. Marijuana advocates warn that if the challenge succeeds, it could boost the black market and put criminal organizations back in charge. The lawsuit accuses Colorado of creating a patchwork of pro-drug policies and licensed distribution schemes, undermining federal drug control efforts.
END OF SUMMARY.
