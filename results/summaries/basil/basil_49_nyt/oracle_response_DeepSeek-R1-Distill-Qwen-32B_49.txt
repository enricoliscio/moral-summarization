Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a lawsuit against Colorado's marijuana legalization, arguing that it's causing problems in their states.

I should identify the key morally framed words the author used: created, flows, draining, stress, coming, problem, defend, succeed, put, charge, ignoring, development, policies, schemes, found, acquiring, influx. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words. I'll start by stating the lawsuit's purpose, then the arguments from both sides. I'll mention the impact on neighboring states, Colorado's defense, and the potential consequences if the lawsuit succeeds.

I should structure the summary to include the main points: the states involved, the reason for the lawsuit, the impact on treasuries and criminal justice, Colorado's response, and the implications for the marijuana market. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words where appropriate.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes the necessary moral framing. I'll check that all key points are covered and that the language reflects the original article's tone.

SUMMARY:  
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit challenging Colorado's marijuana legalization, arguing it has "created a dangerous gap" in federal drug-control systems. They claim Colorado's regulated marijuana market "flows" into their states, "draining" their treasuries and causing "stress" on their criminal justice systems. Sheriffs in border counties report an "influx" of marijuana, leading to more arrests and higher costs. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, vows to "defend" against the challenge, which targets the commercial side of legalization. Marijuana advocates warn that if Nebraska and Oklahoma "succeed," it could "put" violent criminal organizations "back in charge." The lawsuit accuses Colorado of "ignoring" federal drug laws and "scheme[s]" that allow marijuana to be "acquired" by criminal groups. Colorado's lack of tracking and background checks on buyers is also criticized. While the lawsuit does not aim to overturn personal use, its success could disrupt the regulated market, potentially "undermining" state efforts to control marijuana.  

END OF SUMMARY.
