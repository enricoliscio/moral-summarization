SUMMARY: Two heartland states, Nebraska and Oklahoma, have filed a lawsuit challenging the legalization of marijuana in Colorado, arguing that it has negative effects on their states. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's regulated recreational marijuana shops are piping marijuana into neighboring states and undermining their own marijuana bans, resulting in increased costs for law enforcement, the courts, and jails. It accuses Colorado of creating a dangerous gap in federal drug control and alleges that the state's lax regulations allow marijuana to flow out of state easily. Colorado's attorney general has vowed to vigorously defend against the lawsuit, stating that it is without merit. Marijuana advocates also argue that shutting down retail stores could boost the black market and put criminal organizations back in charge. The lawsuit, filed directly with the Supreme Court, seeks to strike down key parts of the 2012 voter-approved measure that legalized marijuana in Colorado. It remains to be seen whether Nebraska and Oklahoma will succeed in their challenge, but the case highlights the ongoing debate and moral dilemma surrounding marijuana legalization in the United States. END OF SUMMARY.
