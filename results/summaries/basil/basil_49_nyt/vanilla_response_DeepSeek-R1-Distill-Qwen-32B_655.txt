SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado's 2012 marijuana legalization law, arguing that Colorado's regulated recreational marijuana market is causing marijuana to flow into their states, undermining their marijuana bans and increasing law enforcement costs. The lawsuit, brought by the states' attorneys general, claims Colorado has created a "dangerous gap" in federal drug control systems. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, dismissed the challenge as "without merit," stating they will defend the law. The lawsuit focuses on the commercial aspects of marijuana legalization, not personal use. Marijuana advocates warn that shutting down Colorado's legal market could revive the black market. The suit accuses Colorado of violating federal drug laws by not tracking marijuana sales or requiring background checks for buyers. While some border law enforcement officials report increased marijuana seizures, others say they haven't seen a significant increase. END OF SUMMARY.
