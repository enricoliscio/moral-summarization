SUMMARY:
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its recreational marijuana shops are creating a "dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system. They argue that marijuana is flowing into their states, "undermining" their bans, "draining" their treasuries, and placing "stress" on their criminal justice systems. The lawsuit accuses Colorado of participating in a "scheme" that cultivates, packages, and distributes marijuana in direct violation of controlled-substances laws, while "ignoring" every objective embodied in the federal drug control regulation. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, has called the challenge "without merit" and vowed to "vigorously defend" against the lawsuit. Marijuana advocates warn that if the lawsuit succeeds, it could boost the "violent" black market. END OF SUMMARY.
