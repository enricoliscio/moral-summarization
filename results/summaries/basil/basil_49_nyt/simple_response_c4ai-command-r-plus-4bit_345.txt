SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit against Colorado on Thursday, challenging the state's legalization of marijuana. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's system of state-regulated recreational marijuana shops has led to an increase in marijuana flowing into neighboring states, undermining their own marijuana bans and causing financial and law enforcement strains. While federal officials have largely allowed states to implement their own marijuana programs, Nebraska and Oklahoma argue that Colorado has created a dangerous gap in federal drug control. Colorado's attorney general has vowed to vigorously defend against the lawsuit, which is aimed at the commercial side of legalization and does not seek to overturn personal use and possession laws. Marijuana advocates warn that shutting down retailers could boost the black market and put criminal organizations back in charge. The lawsuit accuses Colorado of participating in a scheme that directly violates federal drug control laws and regulations. It remains to be seen whether the Supreme Court will take up the case.
END OF SUMMARY.
