Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a lawsuit against Colorado's marijuana laws. They're challenging Colorado's 2012 legalization because they say it's causing marijuana to flow into their states, leading to more arrests and costs. Colorado's attorney general says the challenge is without merit. The lawsuit focuses on the commercial aspects, not personal use. Marijuana advocates worry it could boost the black market if the lawsuit succeeds.

I should include the key points: who filed the lawsuit, why, the impact they claim, Colorado's response, and the potential consequences. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures all the main elements.

SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado's 2012 marijuana legalization law, arguing that it has led to an influx of marijuana into their states, increasing arrests, costs, and strain on their criminal justice systems. The lawsuit, brought by the states' attorneys general, claims Colorado's regulated marijuana system creates a "dangerous gap" in federal drug control, allowing marijuana to flow into neighboring states. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, dismissed the challenge as "without merit," stating they will defend against it. The lawsuit targets the commercial aspects of Colorado's marijuana industry, not its legality for personal use. Marijuana advocates warn that a successful lawsuit could revive the black market. The suit accuses Colorado of violating federal laws by enabling the distribution of marijuana across state lines, despite legal restrictions. Colorado's lack of tracking and background checks on buyers is also criticized. The case was filed directly with the U.S. Supreme Court as a state dispute. END OF SUMMARY.
