SUMMARY: The attorneys general of Nebraska and Oklahoma filed the first major legal challenge to marijuana legalization on Thursday, arguing that Colorado's system of recreational marijuana shops has led to increased marijuana flow into neighboring states and should be shut down. The lawsuit, filed directly with the US Supreme Court, argues that Colorado's legalization measure has created a dangerous gap in federal drug control and undermined the marijuana bans in neighboring states, leading to increased arrests and costs for law enforcement. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, has pledged to vigorously defend the state's legalization measure, known as Amendment 64, which was approved by voters in 2012. The lawsuit from Nebraska and Oklahoma focuses on the commercial side of marijuana legalization and does not seek to overturn the portion of Amendment 64 that made marijuana legal for personal use and possession. Marijuana advocates argue that shutting down retail stores could boost the black market and put criminal organizations back in charge. The lawsuit accuses Colorado of participating in a scheme that violates federal drug control laws and cultivates, packages, and distributes marijuana. It remains to be seen whether the Supreme Court will take up the case.
END OF SUMMARY.
