SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that the state's legalized recreational marijuana is causing marijuana to flow into their states, undermining their bans, and straining their law enforcement resources. The lawsuit, filed with the US Supreme Court, argues that Colorado's regulated marijuana shops are creating a "dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system. The states claim that the influx of marijuana has led to more arrests, impounded vehicles, and higher jail and court costs. Colorado's attorney general has dismissed the challenge, saying it is "without merit" and promising to vigorously defend the state's laws. Marijuana advocates warn that shutting down retailers could boost the black market. The lawsuit targets the commercial side of legalization, but does not seek to overturn the portion of the law that made marijuana legal for personal use and possession.

END OF SUMMARY.
