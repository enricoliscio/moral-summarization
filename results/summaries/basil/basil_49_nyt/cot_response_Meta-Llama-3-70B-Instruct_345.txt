SUMMARY:
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalized marijuana is creating a "dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system. They argue that marijuana is flowing from Colorado into their states, "undermining" their bans and "stressing" their criminal justice systems. The lawsuit accuses Colorado of "ignoring" federal drug laws and creating a "patchwork" of state and local policies. Colorado officials have responded that the challenge is "without merit" and they will "vigorously defend" against the lawsuit. Marijuana advocates warn that shutting down retailers could boost the "violent criminal organizations" and create a "huge" hole in marijuana rules. The lawsuit highlights the tension between states with legalized marijuana and those that have outlawed it. END OF SUMMARY.
