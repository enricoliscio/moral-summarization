SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, arguing that its legalization of recreational marijuana has led to a "dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's regulated marijuana shops are piping marijuana into neighboring states, undermining their marijuana bans, and placing a strain on their criminal justice systems. The lawsuit alleges that Colorado's lack of regulations, such as not tracking marijuana once it's sold and not requiring criminal background checks for buyers, has created an opportunity for criminal organizations to acquire marijuana inventory directly from retail stores. Marijuana advocates argue that shutting down marijuana retailers would boost the black market. Colorado's attorney general has vowed to defend the state's marijuana laws, calling the challenge "without merit." The lawsuit is aimed at the commercial side of marijuana legalization, and if successful, could shut down recreational stores, dispensaries, and production facilities.

END OF SUMMARY.
