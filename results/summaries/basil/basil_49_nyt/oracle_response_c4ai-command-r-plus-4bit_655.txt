SUMMARY: Two heartland states, Nebraska and Oklahoma, have filed a lawsuit with the United States Supreme Court to shut down Colorado's state-regulated recreational marijuana shops, arguing that they are "draining their treasuries and placing stress on their criminal justice systems." The lawsuit accuses Colorado of creating a dangerous gap in federal drug control, allowing marijuana to flow into neighboring states and undermining their own marijuana bans. Law enforcement in these states claim they have seen an increase in marijuana-related arrests, impounded vehicles, and higher costs for their jails and courts as a result. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, defended the state's legalization, arguing that the challenge is without merit and that they will vigorously defend against the lawsuit. Nebraska and Oklahoma's challenge targets the commercial side of marijuana legalization, arguing that it has ignored federal drug control regulations and created a scheme that cultivates, packages, and distributes marijuana. They argue that Colorado's lack of tracking and background checks allows criminal enterprises to acquire marijuana from retail stores. The lawsuit accuses Colorado of ignoring federal laws and creating a patchwork of pro-drug policies and licensed distribution schemes. Marijuana advocates argue that if Nebraska and Oklahoma succeed, they will put criminal organizations back in charge.
END OF SUMMARY.
