SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed the first major legal challenge to marijuana legalization, asking the US Supreme Court to strike down key parts of Colorado's 2012 law that legalized marijuana for adult use. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's legalization has led to an increase in marijuana flowing into neighboring states, undermining their own marijuana bans and straining law enforcement resources. While some border sheriffs have complained about an influx of Colorado marijuana, others have not seen an increase. Nebraska and Oklahoma's lawsuit targets the commercial side of legalization, including the system of regulations, taxes, and retail stores. It does not seek to overturn the portion of the law that made personal use and possession legal. Marijuana advocates argue that shutting down retailers could boost the black market and put criminal organizations back in charge. Colorado's attorney general has vowed to defend the state's marijuana laws, calling the challenge "without merit." The lawsuit was filed directly with the Supreme Court as it involves a dispute among states.
END OF SUMMARY.
