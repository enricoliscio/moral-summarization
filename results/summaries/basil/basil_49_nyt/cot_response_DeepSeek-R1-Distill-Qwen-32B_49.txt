Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to identify the morally charged words. Words like "challenge," "illegal," "gap," "undermine," "strain," "problem," "without merit," "scheme," "violates," "patchwork," "pro-drug," "holes," "easily," "track," "background checks," "criminal enterprises," "gangs," "cartels," "inventory," "influx," "statistics," "increase." 

Next, I'll structure the summary. It should start with Nebraska and Oklahoma filing a lawsuit against Colorado's marijuana laws. They argue that Colorado's system is causing problems in their states, like more arrests and costs. Colorado's attorney general defends the law. The lawsuit targets the commercial side, not personal use. Marijuana advocates warn it could boost the black market. The lawsuit claims Colorado isn't enforcing regulations properly, making it easy for illegal activities. Some law enforcement didn't see an increase, but others did. The summary needs to include as many of those moral words as possible without being too long.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points: the lawsuit, the arguments from both sides, the potential impact on the black market, and the specific criticisms about Colorado's regulations. I'll keep each sentence concise and stick to the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit challenging Colorado's marijuana legalization, arguing it creates a "dangerous gap" in federal drug control, leading to increased marijuana flows into their states. They claim this undermines their bans, strains their criminal justice systems, and drains treasuries. Colorado's attorney general defends the law, stating it is "without merit." The lawsuit targets Colorado's commercial marijuana system, not personal use, but advocates warn a shutdown could boost the black market. Colorado's regulations, including no tracking or background checks, are criticized for enabling criminal enterprises. While some law enforcement report increased marijuana influx, others say they haven't seen an increase. The case highlights tensions over state vs. federal drug policies.
