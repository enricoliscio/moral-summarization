SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalized marijuana is "flowing" into their states and "draining" their resources. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's laws have "created a dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system, allowing marijuana to "flow" into neighboring states and "stress" their criminal justice systems. The lawsuit claims that the influx of marijuana has led to more arrests, impounded vehicles, and higher jail and court costs. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, has dismissed the lawsuit as "without merit" and vowed to "defend" the state's laws. Marijuana advocates warn that if the lawsuit "succeeds", it could "put" violent criminal organizations "back in charge". The lawsuit accuses Colorado officials of "ignoring" federal drug laws and "developing" a "scheme" to distribute marijuana. Nebraska and Oklahoma claim that Colorado's laws have "huge holes" that allow marijuana to "flow" out of state, and that the state is not tracking marijuana sales or requiring background checks on buyers. 

END OF SUMMARY.
