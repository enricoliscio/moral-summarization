Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand what's going on.

The article is about Nebraska and Oklahoma suing Colorado over its marijuana legalization. They argue that Colorado's legal weed is causing problems in their states, like more arrests and higher costs. They're asking the Supreme Court to strike down Colorado's law.

I should note the key points: the lawsuit, the states involved, their arguments about the impact on their criminal justice systems and treasuries. Also, Colorado's response that the challenge is without merit.

I need to keep the moral framing, which includes the states' concerns about Colorado's laws leading to increased marijuana flow, affecting their law enforcement and budgets. Also, the counterargument from Colorado that their program is legitimate and that the lawsuit is unfounded.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step: introduce the lawsuit, the plaintiffs, their arguments, Colorado's response, and the implications if they lose.

Wait, also, the article mentions that the lawsuit doesn't target personal use, so that's an important point. Plus, the potential impact on the black market if Colorado's retail is shut down.

I need to include that the lawsuit focuses on the commercial aspects and the constitutional argument about state policies conflicting with federal laws. Also, the criticism about Colorado's lack of tracking and background checks.

I should make sure to include the voices from both sides: the sheriffs complaining about the influx and Colorado's attorney general dismissing the claims.

Let me try to draft a concise summary that hits all these points without going over the word limit. I'll need to be clear and direct, making sure each sentence adds value and stays within the moral framing presented in the article.

SUMMARY:  
Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, challenging its 2012 marijuana legalization law. They argue that Colorado's regulated marijuana system creates a "dangerous gap" in federal drug control, leading to increased marijuana flow into their states, higher law enforcement costs, and strained criminal justice systems. Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers, dismissed the lawsuit as "without merit," stating they will defend the law. The lawsuit targets Colorado's commercial marijuana system, including regulated stores and dispensaries, while not challenging the legality of personal use. Critics argue that shutting down Colorado's legal market could revive the black market, controlled by criminal organizations. The suit accuses Colorado of violating federal drug laws by failing to track marijuana sales and requiring background checks, making it easy for illegal distribution. Colorado counters that its program is legitimate and compliant with state law. The case highlights tensions between state and federal marijuana policies.  
END OF SUMMARY.
