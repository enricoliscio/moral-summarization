Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Nebraska and Oklahoma suing Colorado over their marijuana legalization. The lawsuit claims that Colorado's regulated marijuana shops are causing problems in neighboring states. They argue that it's creating a gap in federal drug control, leading to more marijuana flowing into their states, increasing arrests, and straining their resources. Colorado's attorney general is defending against the lawsuit, saying it's without merit. Marijuana advocates worry that if the lawsuit succeeds, it might boost the black market. 

I should make sure to capture both sides: the plaintiffs' concerns about the impact on their states and Colorado's defense. Also, note the potential consequences if the lawsuit succeeds. I need to keep it under 200 words and use the specified tokens. Let me structure the summary to include the key points: the states involved, the reason for the lawsuit, the impact they claim, Colorado's response, and the implications for the marijuana market.

SUMMARY: Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, challenging its 2012 marijuana legalization law, arguing it creates a "dangerous gap" in federal drug control, leading to increased marijuana flow into their states, more arrests, and strained resources. Colorado's attorney general defends the law, calling the challenge "without merit." Marijuana advocates warn that a successful lawsuit could revive the black market, as Colorado's regulated system would be undermined. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Supreme Court, accuses Colorado of violating federal laws by allowing marijuana distribution without tracking or background checks, enabling criminal enterprises to exploit the system. Colorado counters that the plaintiffs have not provided specific evidence of increased marijuana-related issues. The case highlights tensions between state and federal drug policies. END OF SUMMARY.
