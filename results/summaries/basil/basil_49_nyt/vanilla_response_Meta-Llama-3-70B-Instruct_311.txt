SUMMARY:

Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit against Colorado, claiming that its legalized recreational marijuana is being trafficked into their states, undermining their marijuana bans and causing a drain on their resources. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's regulated marijuana shops are creating a "dangerous gap" in the federal drug-control system, leading to more arrests, impounded vehicles, and higher jail and court costs. The challenge targets the commercial side of marijuana legalization, seeking to shut down retailers, dispensaries, and production facilities. Colorado's attorney general has called the challenge "without merit" and vowed to defend the state's laws. Marijuana advocates warn that shutting down retailers could boost the black market. The lawsuit accuses Colorado of violating federal controlled-substances laws and ignoring federal drug control regulations.

END OF SUMMARY.
