Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about a court challenge against Colorado's marijuana legalization. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral arguments presented.

The article starts by explaining that Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing Colorado over its marijuana laws. They argue that Colorado's regulated marijuana market is causing marijuana to flow into their states, undermining their bans. They mention increased arrests, jail costs, and resource strain on law enforcement. The sheriffs from these states are frustrated because they feel Colorado's laws are causing problems for them.

On the other side, Colorado's attorney general defends the laws, saying the challenge is without merit. Marijuana advocates worry that if the lawsuit succeeds, it might boost the black market, giving more power to criminal organizations.

I need to make sure the summary includes both perspectives: the states suing Colorado and their reasons, Colorado's defense, and the potential consequences of the lawsuit. Also, the moral framing is importantâ€”Nebraska and Oklahoma see Colorado's laws as harmful, while Colorado and advocates see the lawsuit as attacking a legal system that's working.

I should structure the summary to first introduce the lawsuit, then outline the arguments from both sides, and conclude with the potential implications. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I need to be concise but cover all key points without getting bogged down in details.

I'll start by stating that Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit against Colorado's marijuana laws, citing the impact on their states. Then, mention the arguments about the influx of marijuana and the costs. Next, include Colorado's defense and the advocates' concerns about the black market. Finally, note the broader implications regarding state vs. federal laws and public safety.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward, ensuring the moral perspectives are evident. Also, I need to end with the "END OF SUMMARY." token as per the instructions.

Let me draft this step by step, making sure each point flows logically and stays within the word limit. I'll check the word count as I go to ensure compliance.
