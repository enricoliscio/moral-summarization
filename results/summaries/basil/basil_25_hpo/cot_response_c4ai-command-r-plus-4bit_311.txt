SUMMARY: In the context of the 2012 US presidential election, the debate around Medicare policy and the moral implications of the candidates' plans has become complicated. The Romney campaign accuses Obama of endangering Medicare by taking $700 billion out of the program to fund the Affordable Care Act, with RNC Chair Reince Priebus stating that Obama "stole $700 billion from Medicare." This claim has been disputed by fact-checkers and news analysts, as the savings come from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse. Interestingly, the Obama campaign used a similar attack against Senator McCain in 2008, accusing him of planning to "cut Medicare by $800 billion," which would "gamble" with seniors' health care and lead to "ill-conceived" and "badly thought-through" policies. However, FactCheck.org rated this claim as "false," as McCain's plan aimed to limit waste and slow the rate of growth, not slash benefits. The current debate reflects a reluctance to engage in substantive Medicare reform due to concerns about political attacks, with both sides accusing the other of endangering seniors' well-being and benefits.
