SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare reform has become increasingly contentious, with both the Romney and Obama campaigns accusing each other of harmful policies towards seniors. The Romney campaign has accused Obama of "stealing" $700 billion from Medicare to fund his health care overhaul, a claim that has been disputed by independent fact-checkers. Obama's campaign, in turn, has criticized Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program, arguing that it would limit benefits and put seniors at risk. The debate is further complicated by Obama's own previous attacks on Senator John McCain's Medicare plan during the 2008 election, in which he claimed that McCain would cut Medicare by $800 billion and increase costs for seniors. The current debate highlights the challenges of talking substantively about Medicare reform without inviting attacks from opponents. It remains to be seen how the two campaigns will navigate this complex and morally-fraught issue in the lead-up to the election. END OF SUMMARY.
