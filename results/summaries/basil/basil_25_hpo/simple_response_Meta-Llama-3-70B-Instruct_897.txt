SUMMARY:

The Medicare debate between the Romney and Obama campaigns has turned into a complicated back-and-forth, with each side accusing the other of harming people's benefits. The Romney team claims that Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while the Obama team points to the Republican plan to turn Medicare into a quasi-voucher program. However, independent fact-checkers have disputed the Romney campaign's characterization, noting that the savings come from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse, and are used to subsidize insurance for people under the ACA. The Obama campaign is crying foul because it knows how effective this line of criticism can be, having used similar language to attack Sen. John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. The debate has become a moral issue, with each side accusing the other of putting seniors' health care at risk.

END OF SUMMARY.
