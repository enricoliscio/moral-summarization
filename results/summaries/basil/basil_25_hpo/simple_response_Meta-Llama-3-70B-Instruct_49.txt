SUMMARY:

The Medicare debate has become a central issue in the presidential campaign, with both sides accusing each other of harming seniors' benefits. The Romney campaign claims that Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while the Obama campaign argues that the Republican plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program would be more harmful. However, fact-checkers have disputed the Romney campaign's characterization, pointing out that the savings come from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse, and are used to subsidize insurance for people under the ACA. The Obama campaign's outrage is somewhat hypocritical, given that Obama used similar language to attack John McCain's health care plan in 2008. The debate highlights the complexity of Medicare policy and the challenges of reforming the program without being attacked by political opponents.

END OF SUMMARY.
