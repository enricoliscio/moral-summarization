SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare has intensified following Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential nominee. The Romney campaign has criticized President Obama for taking $700 billion out of Medicare to fund the Affordable Care Act, while the Obama campaign has highlighted Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program. The Obama campaign's response to the Romney campaign's criticism is complicated by the fact that Obama made a similar attack against John McCain during the 2008 election, claiming that McCain would cut Medicare by $800 billion. The attack was deemed false by fact-checkers, as McCain was proposing to limit waste and slow the rate of growth, not slash benefits. The current debate over Medicare reform is further complicated by the reluctance of both campaigns to discuss substantive reforms due to concerns over future attacks.
END OF SUMMARY.
