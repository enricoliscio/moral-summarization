Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article discusses the political debate over Medicare between Romney and Obama. Romney accuses Obama of cutting Medicare by $700 billion, but Obama's team argues that the cuts were to reduce waste and fraud, not benefits. The article also mentions how both sides have used similar arguments in past campaigns, like Obama attacking McCain in 2008. I should highlight the accusations and counter-accusations, the context of past campaigns, and the implications for the current debate. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral framing, like Romney's claim of Obama "stealing" funds, is included. I'll structure it to show both sides' arguments and the historical context to provide a balanced summary.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the political debate over Medicare between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama. Romney's team accuses Obama of cutting $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, claiming this harms seniors' benefits. Obama's team counters that the cuts were to reduce waste and fraud in the system, not to slash benefits. The Romney campaign's argument echoes Republican attacks from the 2010 elections, while Obama's team points out that Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, proposed turning Medicare into a voucher program. The article also notes that Obama used similar language in 2008 to criticize John McCain's Medicare plan, accusing him of cutting benefits. Fact-checkers have disputed these claims, arguing that the savings came from reducing waste, not benefits. The debate highlights the political complexity of Medicare reform and the risk of oversimplifying the issue for campaign attacks. END OF SUMMARY.
