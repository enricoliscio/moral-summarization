SUMMARY:

The debate over Medicare has become increasingly complicated, with both the Romney and Obama campaigns accusing each other of harming seniors' benefits. The Romney team claims that Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while the Obama team argues that the Affordable Care Act actually saves money by limiting waste, fraud, and abuse. Independent fact-checkers have disputed the Romney campaign's characterization, pointing out that the savings are used to subsidize insurance for people under the ACA. Interestingly, Obama used similar language to attack John McCain's health care plan in 2008, accusing him of cutting Medicare by $800 billion. This highlights the hypocrisy of both campaigns, as they accuse each other of doing what they themselves have done in the past. The debate has become mired in political posturing, making it difficult to have a substantive discussion about Medicare reform.
