SUMMARY:
The Medicare debate has become complicated, with both the Romney and Obama campaigns accusing each other of harming people's benefits. The Romney team claims Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, saying he has "blood on his hands" regarding Medicare. However, independent fact-checkers dispute this characterization, as the savings come from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse. The Obama campaign is "crying foul" over this criticism, possibly because they know how effective it can be. The Romney campaign's attack is reminiscent of Obama's own criticism of John McCain's health care plan in 2008, which was rated "false" by FactCheck.org. The debate is complicated by the fact that both campaigns have used similar language to attack each other's Medicare proposals, making it difficult to have a substantive discussion about Medicare reform.
