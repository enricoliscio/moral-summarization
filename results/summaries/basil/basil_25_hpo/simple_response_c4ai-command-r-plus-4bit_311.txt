SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare has intensified following Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential nominee, with both campaigns accusing the other of harming seniors' benefits. The Romney campaign has criticized President Obama for taking $700 billion out of Medicare to fund his health care overhaul, while the Obama campaign has highlighted the Republican plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program. The Obama campaign's response to the Romney campaign's accusation is complicated by their own similar attacks on Senator John McCain during the 2008 election, where they claimed McCain would cut Medicare by $800 billion. However, the Obama campaign argues that the savings they achieved came from eliminating waste and fraud, while Romney's plan would cut benefits. The complex nature of the Medicare debate and the potential for future attacks make it challenging for candidates to discuss substantive reform.
