SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare has intensified following Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential nominee. The Romney campaign has accused Barack Obama of "stealing" $700 billion from Medicare to fund his health care overhaul, while the Obama campaign has criticized the Republican plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program. The Obama campaign's response to the Romney campaign's accusation is complicated by their own use of similar attacks against John McCain in the 2008 election. During that campaign, Obama criticized McCain's plan to cut Medicare by $800 billion and increase premiums and co-pays for seniors. However, fact-checkers at the time disputed the claim, noting that McCain was proposing to limit waste and slow the rate of growth, not cut benefits. The current debate over Medicare reform is further complicated by the reluctance of both campaigns to discuss substantive reforms due to concerns over potential future attacks.
END OF SUMMARY.
