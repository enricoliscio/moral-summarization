SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare reform has become increasingly complex, with both the Romney and Obama campaigns accusing each other of harmful policies towards the program. The Romney campaign has criticized Obama for taking $700 billion out of Medicare to fund his health care overhaul, a claim that has been disputed by independent fact-checkers. This attack mirrors a similar line of criticism used by Obama against McCain in the 2008 election, where he accused McCain of planning to cut Medicare by $800 billion. While the Obama campaign cries foul over Romney's characterization of Obama's actions as "stealing", it may also be concerned about the effectiveness of this line of attack, as it was successfully used against them in the 2010 congressional elections. The article also explores the substantive differences in the Medicare proposals of both campaigns, including Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program and Obama's efforts to eliminate fraud and improve benefits for seniors. The debate over Medicare remains a complex and highly politicized issue, with both sides accusing the other of harmful policies and misleading characterizations.
END OF SUMMARY.
