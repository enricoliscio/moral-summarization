SUMMARY:

The Romney and Obama campaigns are engaged in a heated debate over Medicare, with each side accusing the other of harming the program. The Romney campaign claims that Obama's healthcare overhaul took $700 billion from Medicare, while the Obama campaign argues that Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program would be more harmful. Independent fact-checkers have disputed the Romney campaign's characterization, noting that the savings come from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse, and are used to subsidize insurance for people under the Affordable Care Act. The debate has become complicated, with both sides using similar language to attack each other's Medicare plans. The Obama campaign is crying foul over the Romney campaign's criticism, which is reminiscent of the 2010 congressional elections. The debate is likely to continue, making it difficult to have a substantive discussion about Medicare reform.

END OF SUMMARY.
