SUMMARY:

The debate over Medicare has intensified following Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee. The Romney campaign has accused President Obama of "stealing" $700 billion from Medicare to "fund" Obamacare, claiming that Obama has "blood on his hands" in regards to Medicare. However, independent fact-checkers and news analysts have disputed this characterization, pointing out that the savings come from "limiting waste, fraud, and abuse" and are budgeted to "help" subsidize insurance for people under the ACA. The Obama campaign has cried foul over this line of criticism, which may be because it knows how effective it can be. Republicans used a similar attack line in the 2010 congressional elections, and Obama himself used identical language to criticize John McCain's health care plan in 2008. The debate has become complicated, with both sides accusing each other of trying to "harm" people's benefits. The attack on Medicare reform has contributed to a reluctance to talk substantively about the issue, fearing future attacks.

END OF SUMMARY.
