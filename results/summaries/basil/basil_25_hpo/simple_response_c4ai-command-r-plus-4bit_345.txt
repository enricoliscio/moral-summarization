SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare has become increasingly complex, with both the Romney and Obama campaigns accusing each other of harming beneficiaries' interests. The Romney campaign has criticized Obama for taking $700 billion out of Medicare to fund his health care overhaul, a claim that has been disputed by independent fact-checkers. Interestingly, Obama used a similar attack against McCain during the 2008 election, accusing him of planning to cut Medicare by $800 billion. However, the Obama campaign now finds itself in a difficult position as its previous attacks on McCain may complicate its current defense against Romney's criticisms. The complex nature of Medicare politics makes it challenging for candidates to propose substantive reforms without inviting future attacks. This contributes to a general reluctance to engage in meaningful discussions about Medicare reform. END OF SUMMARY.
