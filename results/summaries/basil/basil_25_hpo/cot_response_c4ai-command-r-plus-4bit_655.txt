SUMMARY:
The selection of Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's running mate has complicated the politics of Medicare. The Romney campaign accused President Obama of stealing $700 billion from Medicare to fund his health care law, a claim that has been disputed by fact-checkers. This line of attack mirrors a tactic used by Obama against John McCain in 2008, when he accused McCain of planning to cut Medicare by $800 billion, which independent analysts deemed false. The Obama campaign cries foul over the Romney campaign's accusation, knowing the effectiveness of such an attack in past elections. The back-and-forth between the campaigns obscures the complex realities of Medicare reform, with both sides reluctant to engage substantively for fear of political backlash. The moral framing of the debate, with accusations of harm, theft, and demagoguery, complicates the dialogue and underscores the challenges of addressing Medicare reform.
