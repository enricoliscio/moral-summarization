SUMMARY:

The Romney and Obama campaigns are engaged in a heated debate over Medicare, with each side accusing the other of harming the program. The Romney campaign claims that Obama's healthcare overhaul took $700 billion from Medicare, while the Obama campaign argues that the Republican plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program would harm benefits. Independent fact-checkers have disputed the Romney campaign's characterization, noting that the savings from the Affordable Care Act come from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse, and are used to subsidize insurance for people under the ACA. The debate has become complicated, with both sides accusing each other of demagoguery. The Obama campaign has cried foul over the Romney campaign's criticism, which is similar to an attack line used by Republicans in the 2010 congressional elections. The debate has also drawn attention to past criticisms made by Obama against John McCain's healthcare plan, which were rated as "false" by FactCheck.org.

END OF SUMMARY.
