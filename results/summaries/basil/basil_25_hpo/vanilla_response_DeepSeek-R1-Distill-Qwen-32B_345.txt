Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Medicare debate between Obama and Romney. The article is a bit long, so I should read through it carefully to pick out the main points.

First, the article starts by mentioning Romney choosing Paul Ryan as his VP, which has made Medicare politics complicated. Both campaigns are accusing each other of harming Medicare benefits. The Obama team is pointing out Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system, while Romney's team is criticizing Obama for taking $700 billion out of Medicare for Obamacare.

Wait, the article mentions that the $700 billion comes from limiting the growth rate, waste, fraud, and abuse, especially in Medicare Advantage. Fact-checkers say Romney's characterization is disputed. But the Obama campaign is upset because Republicans used a similar argument in 2010, and Obama himself used a similar line against McCain in 2008.

So, there's a bit of history here. In 2008, Obama attacked McCain for cutting Medicare by $800 billion, but it turned out McCain was talking about reducing waste, not cutting benefits. FactCheck.org called that ad "false." Now, the Romney campaign is using the same tactic against Obama, which is causing confusion and complicating the debate.

The article also mentions that the current debate might make it harder for politicians to discuss Medicare reform without fearing future attacks. So, the key points are: Romney and Obama accusing each other of harming Medicare, the $700 billion figure, the history of similar attacks, and how this makes it hard to have a substantive discussion on reform.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too bogged down in details. I should also mention that both sides are using past criticisms to their advantage, and that the debate is making it difficult to have a meaningful conversation about Medicare reform.

SUMMARY: The Medicare debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney has intensified, with each campaign accusing the other of harming the program. Romney's team criticizes Obama for taking $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while Obama's team argues the savings came from reducing waste and fraud, not cutting benefits. This mirrors a similar attack Obama used against John McCain in 2008, where Obama accused McCain of slashing Medicare by $800 billion, though McCain's plan focused on reducing waste. Fact-checkers have disputed these claims, noting they often conflate reducing waste with cutting benefits. The current debate is further complicated by historical accusations, making it harder for politicians to discuss Medicare reform without facing criticism. END OF SUMMARY.
