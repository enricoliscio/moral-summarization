Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about the Medicare debate between Romney and Obama, and how each side accuses the other of harming Medicare benefits.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It starts with Romney choosing Paul Ryan, leading to a complex Medicare debate. The campaigns are arguing over who would do more harm. Obama's team points out Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system, while Romney's team accuses Obama of taking $700 billion from Medicare for Obamacare.

The article mentions that the $700 billion is from limiting the growth rate, waste, fraud, and abuse, especially in Medicare Advantage. Fact-checkers dispute Romney's characterization, but Obama's team knows this criticism is effective because Republicans used it in 2010. It then goes back to 2008 when Obama criticized McCain for cutting Medicare by $800 billion, using similar language.

McCain's plan involved efficiency in delivery and possibly higher premiums for high-income seniors. FactCheck.org called Obama's ad "false," as McCain wasn't cutting benefits but targeting waste. The article also notes that Obama's plan saved money by eliminating subsidies and waste, improving seniors' benefits. Romney and McCain opposed these savings and used demagoguery.

The summary needs to capture the back-and-forth, the accusations, the context of past campaigns, and how this affects the current debate. It should highlight the moral framing, like Romney's team accusing Obama of stealing money, and Obama's team pointing out Romney's plan's flaws.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key moral points each side is making. I'll structure it by first introducing the debate, then each side's accusations, the context from past campaigns, and the implications for the current discussion.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Also, I need to maintain the moral framing, so I'll use phrases like "accused," "stole," "harm," "cuts," etc., to reflect the tone.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each point is covered without exceeding the word limit. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within 200 words.

SUMMARY: The Medicare debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama has intensified, with each side accusing the other of harming the program. Romney's team claims Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while Obama's team criticizes Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system. The $700 billion figure refers to limiting Medicare's growth rate and reducing waste, particularly in Medicare Advantage, to fund Obamacare. Fact-checkers dispute Romney's characterization, but Obama's team acknowledges the criticism's effectiveness, as Republicans used it in 2010. The article recalls Obama's 2008 attack on John McCain, accusing him of cutting $800 billion from Medicare, though McCain's plan focused on efficiency and reducing waste. FactCheck.org labeled Obama's claim as "false," as McCain wasn't cutting benefits. Obama's plan saved money by eliminating waste and improving seniors' benefits. Romney and McCain opposed these savings, using demagoguery to criticize Obama. This historical context complicates the current debate, highlighting the political reluctance to discuss Medicare reform substantively. END OF SUMMARY.
