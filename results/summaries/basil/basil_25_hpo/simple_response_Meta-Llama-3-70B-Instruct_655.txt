SUMMARY:

The Medicare debate between the Romney and Obama campaigns has turned into a heated exchange of accusations. The Romney team claims that Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while the Obama team argues that the Affordable Care Act actually saves money by limiting waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare Advantage. Independent fact-checkers and news analysts have disputed the Romney campaign's characterization. However, the Obama campaign is crying foul because they know how effective this line of criticism can be, having used similar language to attack Sen. John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. The Romney campaign's attack is seen as hypocritical, given that their own plan would also involve significant changes to Medicare. The debate highlights the complexity of Medicare policy and the difficulty of having an honest discussion about reform without fear of political attacks.

END OF SUMMARY.
