SUMMARY:

The Medicare debate between the Romney and Obama campaigns has become increasingly complicated, with both sides accusing each other of harming seniors' benefits. The Romney campaign claims Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while the Obama campaign argues that the Republican plan to turn Medicare into a quasi-voucher program would lead to higher premiums and copays, making seniors' healthcare a "gamble". Independent fact-checkers dispute the Romney campaign's characterization, pointing out that the savings come from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse, and are budgeted to help subsidize insurance for people under the ACA.

The Obama campaign's criticism of Romney's plan is ironic, given that Obama himself used similar language to attack John McCain's healthcare plan in 2008, claiming it would cut Medicare by $800 billion and lead to "drastic cuts" in benefits. However, the McCain campaign's plan aimed to eliminate fraud and reform payment policies, not slash benefits. The debate highlights the complexity of Medicare reform and the reluctance to discuss it substantively, fearing future attacks.

END OF SUMMARY.
