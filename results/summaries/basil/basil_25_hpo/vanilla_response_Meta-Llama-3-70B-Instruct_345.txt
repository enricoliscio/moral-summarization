SUMMARY:

The politics of Medicare have become complicated in the wake of Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee. The Romney campaign has accused President Obama of taking $700 billion out of Medicare to fund Obamacare, but independent fact-checkers and news analysts have disputed this characterization. The Obama campaign has pointed out that the money being taken out of the system is mostly derived from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse, and is budgeted to help subsidize insurance for people under the ACA. Interestingly, Obama used similar language to attack his 2008 opponent John McCain, accusing him of cutting Medicare by $800 billion. This has led to a complicated political dialogue, with both sides accusing each other of harming Medicare benefits. The debate has also highlighted the reluctance to talk substantively about Medicare reform due to concerns of inviting future attacks.
