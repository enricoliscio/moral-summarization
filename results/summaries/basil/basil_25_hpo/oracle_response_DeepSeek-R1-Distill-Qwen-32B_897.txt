Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. They want the summary to include as many of those words as possible, and it should be under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Medicare debate between Romney and Obama, with Romney accusing Obama of stealing $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare. The article also mentions that Obama used similar tactics against McCain in 2008, accusing him of cutting Medicare benefits. Fact-checkers say both Romney and Obama are misrepresenting the facts, as the savings come from reducing waste, not cutting benefits.

Now, I need to identify the key morally charged words from the list that are used in the article. Words like "stole," "harm," "fund," "blood," "cut," "fraud," "abuse," "savings," "reform," etc., are important here. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by outlining the main points: Romney's accusation, Obama's counter, the history with McCain, fact-checkers' take, and the implications for the debate. I'll make sure each point includes the moral framing words.

I need to keep the summary concise, so I'll focus on the essential details without getting too bogged down in specifics. Also, I should end the summary by noting how these accusations complicate the dialogue, using words like "complicate" and "contribute."

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and includes the necessary moral terms. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words. Once done, I'll make sure it starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

I think that's a solid plan. Time to put it all together.

SUMMARY: The Medicare debate has intensified as Mitt Romney accuses Barack Obama of "stealing $700 billion" from Medicare to "fund" Obamacare, claiming Obama has "blood on his hands." Obama's team counters that the savings came from "limiting waste, fraud, and abuse" in Medicare Advantage, not cutting benefits. Romney's campaign frames this as a "rejoinder" to Obama's $700 billion "cuts," while independent fact-checkers dispute the characterization, noting the savings were from "eliminating" inefficiencies, not harming seniors. This mirrors Obama's 2008 attack on John McCain, accusing him of "drastic Medicare cuts" of $800 billion, though McCain's plan focused on "reforming" payment policies and "reducing" waste. Obama's current campaign emphasizes that his administration "improved" Medicare by reducing "unnecessary subsidies" and "providing" preventive care, while Romney and Ryan have "opposed" these reforms, using "demagoguery" to obscure the facts. The debate risks "complicating" substantive discussions on Medicare reform, as both sides exploit "characterizations" to "fund" their political narratives. END OF SUMMARY.
