SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare has intensified following Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential candidate. The Romney campaign has accused President Obama of "stealing" $700 billion from Medicare to fund the Affordable Care Act, a claim that has been disputed by independent fact-checkers. The Obama campaign, in turn, criticized the Republican plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program. This back-and-forth reflects the complexity of Medicare politics and policy. Interestingly, Obama used similar language during his 2008 campaign, attacking John McCain for planning to cut Medicare by $800 billion. While fact-checkers at the time rated Obama's ad as "false," the attack line contributed to a broader critique of McCain's healthcare proposals. The current debate underscores the challenges of discussing Medicare reform without inviting future political attacks.
END OF SUMMARY.
