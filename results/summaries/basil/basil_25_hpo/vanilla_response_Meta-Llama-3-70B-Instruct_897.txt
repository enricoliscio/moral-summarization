SUMMARY:

The Romney and Obama campaigns are engaged in a heated debate over Medicare, with each side accusing the other of harming the program. The Romney campaign claims that Obama's healthcare overhaul took $700 billion from Medicare, while the Obama campaign argues that Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program would harm seniors. However, fact-checkers have disputed the Romney campaign's characterization, noting that the savings from the Affordable Care Act come from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse, and are used to subsidize insurance for people under the ACA. The Obama campaign is crying foul, but it's notable that Obama used similar language to attack John McCain's healthcare plan in 2008. The debate has become complicated, with both sides trading accusations and making it difficult to have a substantive discussion about Medicare reform.

END OF SUMMARY.
