SUMMARY:

The politics of Medicare have become complicated in the wake of Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee. The Romney campaign claims that President Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while the Obama campaign argues that the Republican plan would turn Medicare into a quasi-voucher program, harming benefits. However, fact-checkers and news analysts have disputed the Romney campaign's characterization, noting that the savings come from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse, and are used to subsidize insurance for people under the Affordable Care Act. The Obama campaign has also been accused of hypocrisy, as Obama used similar language to attack John McCain's health care plan in 2008. The debate has become intense, with both sides accusing each other of harming Medicare benefits.

END OF SUMMARY.
