SUMMARY:

The politics of Medicare have become complicated in the wake of Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee. The Romney campaign has accused President Obama of "stealing" $700 billion from Medicare to "fund" Obamacare, claiming that Obama has "blood on his hands" when it comes to Medicare. However, independent fact-checkers have disputed this characterization, pointing out that the savings come from "limiting waste, fraud, and abuse" in Medicare Advantage and are budgeted to "help" subsidize insurance for people under the ACA. The Obama campaign has cried foul, noting that Romney's plan would "cut" Medicare benefits and "harm" seniors. The debate has become intense, with both sides accusing each other of "demagoguery" and "cutting" benefits. The issue is further complicated by the fact that Obama used similar language to attack John McCain's health care plan in 2008, which was rated "false" by FactCheck.org.

END OF SUMMARY.
