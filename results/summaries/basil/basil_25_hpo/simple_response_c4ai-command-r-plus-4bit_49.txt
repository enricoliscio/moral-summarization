SUMMARY: In the 2012 election, the politics of Medicare have become a heated issue, with both the Romney and Obama campaigns accusing each other of endangering the program. The Romney campaign has criticized Obama for taking $700 billion out of Medicare to fund his health care overhaul, while the Obama campaign has highlighted Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program. The Obama campaign's response to the Romney campaign's attacks is particularly notable as they used similar language to criticize Senator John McCain's Medicare plan during the 2008 election. However, fact-checkers and analysts have disputed the accuracy of the Romney campaign's claims, noting that the savings in the Affordable Care Act come mostly from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse. This complex political dialogue highlights the challenges and risks associated with proposing substantive Medicare reforms, as any proposal can be easily distorted and used as a weapon by opponents.
