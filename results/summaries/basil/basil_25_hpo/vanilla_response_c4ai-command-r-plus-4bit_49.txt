SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare has intensified following Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential nominee. The Romney campaign has accused President Obama of taking $700 billion out of Medicare to fund the Affordable Care Act, while the Obama campaign has criticized the Republican plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program. Independent fact-checkers have disputed the Romney campaign's claim, noting that the savings come from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse. Interestingly, Obama used similar attacks against Senator John McCain during the 2008 election, accusing him of planning to cut Medicare by $800 billion. However, Obama's current campaign press secretary, Ben LaBolt, defends the president's actions by stating that Obama achieved savings by eliminating unnecessary subsidies and improving seniors' benefits. This complex debate over Medicare reform and the political attacks surrounding it contribute to a general reluctance to engage in substantive discussions about the issue.
