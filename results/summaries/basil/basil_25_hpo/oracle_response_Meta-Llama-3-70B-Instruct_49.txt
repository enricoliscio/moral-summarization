SUMMARY:

The Medicare debate has become a central issue in the presidential campaign, with both sides accusing each other of causing harm to seniors' benefits. The Romney campaign claims that Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while the Obama campaign argues that Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a quasi-voucher program would lead to cuts in benefits. However, independent fact-checkers have disputed the Romney campaign's characterization, pointing out that the savings come from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse, and are budgeted to help subsidize insurance for people under the ACA.

The Obama campaign is crying foul over this line of criticism, which may be because they know how effective it can be. Republicans used a similar attack line in the 2010 congressional elections, and Obama himself used identical language to criticize John McCain's health care plan in 2008. The debate has become complicated, with both sides accusing each other of making drastic cuts to Medicare, and it remains to be seen who will come out on top.

END OF SUMMARY.
