Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Medicare debate between Obama and Romney. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning Romney choosing Paul Ryan and the resulting political complexity around Medicare. It talks about both campaigns accusing each other of harming Medicare benefits. Obama's team points out Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system, while Romney's team accuses Obama of taking $700 billion from Medicare for Obamacare.

I should note that the Romney campaign's accusation is being disputed by fact-checkers, who say the money was from limiting growth, waste, fraud, and abuse, especially in Medicare Advantage. The savings helped fund the ACA. The article also brings up how both parties have used similar arguments in past elections, like Obama attacking McCain in 2008.

The user wants the summary to be concise, under 200 words, and include the moral framing. So, I need to highlight the accusations and counter-accusations, the fact-checking disputes, and the historical context of similar attacks. I should mention that both sides have used these arguments before, which adds to the complexity and reluctance to discuss real reforms.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and captures all these points without getting too bogged down in details. I'll structure it by first stating the current debate, then the accusations, the fact-checking, the historical context, and the impact on the political dialogue.

Let me make sure I include key terms like "voucher program," "blood on their hands," "fact-checkers," "limiting growth," "waste, fraud, abuse," "Medicare Advantage," "ACA," "Obama's 2008 attack on McCain," and the overall reluctance to discuss reforms. 

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Also, since the user wants it after a "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY.", I'll format it accordingly without any markdown.

Alright, I think I have a good structure in mind. Let me put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare has intensified following Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee. The Romney campaign accuses President Obama of "stealing" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, a claim disputed by independent fact-checkers who argue the savings came from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse, particularly in Medicare Advantage, and reducing the program's growth rate. Obama's team counters that Romney's plan would turn Medicare into a voucher system, harming benefits. The article highlights the political complexity of Medicare, noting that both parties have historically used similar arguments to attack each other. In 2008, Obama criticized John McCain for proposing Medicare cuts, while Romney's team now uses the same rhetoric against Obama. The ongoing debate underscores the reluctance to engage in substantive Medicare reform, as any proposal risks being weaponized in future political battles. END OF SUMMARY.
