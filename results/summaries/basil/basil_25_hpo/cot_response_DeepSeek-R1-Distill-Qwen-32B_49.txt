Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary that preserves the moral framing from the original article. They've given me specific steps: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and then write a concise summary using those terms.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a strong emotional or judgmental connotation, often used to influence opinion. Words like "stole," "raided," "drastic," "gamble," "false," "attack," "oppose," "demagogue," "ironically," "reluctance," "attack," "complicate," "future attacks." These words are used to convey blame, criticism, or moral judgment.

Next, I need to summarize the article. The article discusses the political debate over Medicare between Romney and Obama. Romney's team accuses Obama of cutting Medicare funds to finance Obamacare, while Obama's team counters that Romney's plan would harm Medicare more. The article also references past attacks, like Obama criticizing McCain for Medicare cuts, which were later shown to be misleading. The debate is complex, and the moral framing is evident in the language used by both sides.

I need to make sure the summary includes these morally charged words and accurately reflects the back-and-forth accusations, the historical context, and the impact on the political discourse. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and highlight the moral aspects without getting bogged down in policy details.

I should structure the summary to first introduce the current debate, then mention the accusations from both sides, reference the past attacks, and conclude with the ongoing complexity and reluctance to discuss reforms due to potential future attacks.

Let me put this together, ensuring that the morally framed words are included and the summary flows logically.

**SUMMARY:**  

The debate over Medicare has intensified as Mitt Romney's team accuses Barack Obama of "stealing" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while Obama's team counters that Romney's plan would harm Medicare more. The Romney campaign argues that Obama's Affordable Care Act "raided" Medicare funds, a claim fact-checkers dispute, as the savings come from limiting waste and fraud. However, the Obama campaign fears the accusation could be politically effective, as Republicans used a similar charge in 2010. The article highlights the irony that Obama once accused John McCain of cutting Medicare by $800 billion, a claim later deemed "false" as McCain's plan focused on reducing waste, not slashing benefits. Obama's team now defends its record, emphasizing that the savings improved seniors' benefits, while Romney's team "demagogues" the issue. The ongoing debate over Medicare reform is complicated by political "reluctance" to discuss substantive changes, as any proposal could invite future "attacks."
