Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Medicare debate between Obama and Romney, preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by talking about Mitt Romney choosing Paul Ryan and the resulting complexity in Medicare politics. The main issue is both campaigns accusing each other of harming Medicare benefits. Obama's team points out Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system, while Romney's team accuses Obama of taking $700 billion from Medicare for Obamacare.

I should note that the Romney campaign is using this $700 billion figure, which comes from limiting the growth of Medicare, not cutting benefits directly. Fact-checkers have disputed their characterization, but the Romney team is framing it as Obama stealing money, which is a strong moral statement.

Looking back, in 2010, Obama used similar tactics against McCain, accusing him of cutting Medicare by $800 billion. The article explains that McCain's plan was about efficiency and reducing waste, not cutting benefits, but Obama's campaign portrayed it as a drastic cut, which was later fact-checked as misleading.

Now, in 2012, Romney is using the same strategy, which might be seen as hypocritical since Obama did the same. The article also mentions that Obama's Affordable Care Act actually saved money by reducing waste and fraud, which helped fund insurance for others, but Romney is framing it as theft.

I need to capture the cycle of accusations, the use of similar tactics by both parties, and the moral framing involved. The summary should highlight the political maneuvering and the impact on the debate's substance.

I should structure it to show how each side accuses the other of harming Medicare, the specifics of their arguments, and the fact-checking that disputes these claims. Also, mention the historical context with McCain and how it affects the current debate's complexity.

Finally, I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all key points: Romney's voucher plan, Obama's $700 billion cut framing, the fact-checking, the historical context with McCain, and the overall impact on the political dialogue.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure each point is clear and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: The Medicare debate between Obama and Romney has become a political battleground, with each side accusing the other of harming the program. Romney's team claims Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while Obama's team points to Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system. Fact-checkers dispute Romney's characterization, as the savings came from limiting waste and slowing growth, not cutting benefits. This mirrors a 2010 attack by Obama on McCain, who was accused of slashing Medicare by $800 billion, though McCain's plan focused on efficiency and reducing waste. Obama's current campaign highlights that his administration saved money by reducing waste and fraud, improving seniors' benefits. The article notes the irony of Romney's team using similar tactics, as Obama previously accused McCain of Medicare cuts. This cycle of accusations complicates the political dialogue, as both sides exploit Medicare for rhetorical gain, hindering substantive reform discussions. END OF SUMMARY.
