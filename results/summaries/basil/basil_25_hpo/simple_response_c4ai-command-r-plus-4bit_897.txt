SUMMARY: In the wake of the selection of Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's vice presidential nominee, the debate over Medicare has intensified, with both campaigns accusing the other of jeopardizing the program. The Romney campaign has criticized President Obama for taking $700 billion out of Medicare to fund the Affordable Care Act, a claim disputed by independent fact-checkers. Interestingly, Obama used a similar attack against Senator John McCain in the 2008 election, accusing him of planning to cut Medicare by $800 billion. While the Obama campaign claims that the current president achieved savings by eliminating waste and fraud, the McCain campaign also argued that their proposed cuts were aimed at waste and inefficient spending. This back-and-forth highlights the challenges of discussing Medicare reform, as any proposal can be easily distorted and used as a political weapon. It also underscores the reluctance of both campaigns to engage in a substantive discussion about Medicare, for fear of inviting future attacks.
