SUMMARY:
The politics of Medicare have become complicated after Mitt Romney chose Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee. The Romney campaign claims that Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, saying he has "blood on his hands." However, independent fact-checkers dispute this characterization, pointing out that the savings come from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse. The Obama campaign is "crying foul" over this line of criticism, which they know can be effective. Republicans used a similar attack in the 2010 congressional elections. Ironically, Obama used similar language to criticize John McCain's health care plan in 2008, saying it would make "drastic cuts" to Medicare. The debate has become mired in accusations of "demagoguery" and "false" claims, making it difficult to have a substantive discussion about Medicare reform. END OF SUMMARY.
