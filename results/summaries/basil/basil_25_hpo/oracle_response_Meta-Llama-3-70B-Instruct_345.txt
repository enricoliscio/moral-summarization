SUMMARY:

The politics of Medicare have become complicated following Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee. The Romney campaign claims that Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to "fund" Obamacare, saying Obama has "blood on his hands" regarding Medicare. However, independent fact-checkers and news analysts dispute this characterization, pointing out that the savings come from "limiting waste, fraud, and abuse" and are budgeted to "help" subsidize insurance for people under the ACA. The Obama campaign is crying foul, as Republicans used a similar attack line in the 2010 congressional elections. Ironically, Obama used similar language to criticize John McCain's health care plan in 2008, accusing him of making "drastic cuts" to Medicare. The debate highlights the complexity of Medicare reform and the risk of "demagoguing" the issue, which could "complicate" the political dialogue and make it harder to have a substantive discussion about Medicare reform.

END OF SUMMARY.
