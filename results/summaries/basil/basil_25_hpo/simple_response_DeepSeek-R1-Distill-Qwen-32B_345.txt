Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Medicare debate between Romney and Obama, preserving the moral framing. The article talks about how both sides are accusing each other of harming Medicare. Romney's team says Obama took $700 billion from Medicare for Obamacare, while Obama's team points out Romney's plan turns Medicare into a voucher system. 

I should note that the Romney campaign is using the same tactic Obama used against McCain in 2008, accusing him of cutting Medicare. The article mentions that the $700 billion is from limiting growth and reducing waste, not cutting benefits. Fact-checkers say the Romney claim is misleading. 

I need to include that both campaigns are using similar arguments, creating a cycle of accusations without real discussion on reform. The moral framing is about who is responsible for harming Medicare, so I should highlight the accusations and the fact that the debate is getting more complicated without real solutions.

I'll structure the summary to mention both sides' accusations, the context of past campaigns, and the impact on the political dialogue. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: The Medicare debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama has intensified, with each side accusing the other of harming the program. Romney's team claims Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while Obama's team points to Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system. Romney's accusation echoes Obama's 2008 attacks on John McCain, who was also accused of cutting Medicare, though the savings were from reducing waste, not benefits. Fact-checkers have disputed Romney's characterization, noting the $700 billion was from limiting growth, not cutting benefits. The article highlights how both campaigns use similar rhetoric, creating a cycle of accusations without substantive discussion on Medicare reform. The debate risks complicating efforts to address the program's challenges, as political attacks overshadow meaningful dialogue. END OF SUMMARY.
