SUMMARY: 
In the wake of Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate, the moral debate over Medicare has grown increasingly heated and *complicated*. The Romney campaign has accused President Obama of *harming* Medicare beneficiaries by *stealing* over $700 billion to fund his health care law, with RNC Chair Reince Priebus claiming Obama has "blood on his hands." This claim has been *disputed* by fact-checkers, yet the Obama campaign is *crying* foul over the attack, aware of its potential effectiveness as seen in previous elections. Obama himself used similar rhetoric against John McCain in 2008, accusing him of planning to *cut* Medicare by $800 billion and calling it a "*gamble*" for seniors. While fact-checkers rated this claim as *false*, it was part of a broader critique of McCain's Medicare proposals, which included a *drastic* plan to tax worker health care plans. The current debate showcases a *reluctance* to engage in *substantive* Medicare reform due to fears of future *attacks* and *complicates* the political dialogue. This news article examines the moral framing of the Medicare debate, highlighting how both sides have utilized criticism of their opponent's plans to score political points, often with limited regard for the accuracy or fairness of their claims.
