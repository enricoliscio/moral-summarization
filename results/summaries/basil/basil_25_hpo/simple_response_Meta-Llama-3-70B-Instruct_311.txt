SUMMARY:

The debate over Medicare has intensified since Mitt Romney chose Paul Ryan as his running mate. The Romney campaign claims that President Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund the Affordable Care Act (ACA), while the Obama campaign argues that the Republican plan would turn Medicare into a voucher program, harming beneficiaries. However, fact-checkers and analysts dispute the Romney campaign's characterization, pointing out that the ACA's savings come from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse, not cutting benefits. Interestingly, Obama used similar language to attack John McCain's healthcare plan in 2008, claiming it would cut Medicare by $800 billion. This highlights the hypocrisy of both campaigns, as they accuse each other of harming Medicare while having previously made similar proposals. The debate has become mired in political posturing, making it difficult to have a substantive discussion about Medicare reform.
