SUMMARY:
In the wake of Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate, the debate over Medicare has grown increasingly contentious and morally charged. The Romney campaign accused President Obama of "stealing" $700 billion from Medicare to fund his health care law, with RNC Chair Reince Priebus claiming Obama had "blood on his hands." This attack mirrors a strategy used by Obama against John McCain in 2008, where he warned that McCain would "cut Medicare by $800 billion" and turn seniors' health care into a "gamble." While fact-checkers have disputed the Romney campaign's claim, the Obama team is wary of the potential effectiveness of this line of attack, given its success in previous elections. The debate centers on complex issues of Medicare reform and funding, with both sides accusing the other of harmful policies that could negatively impact seniors. This moral framing of the issue creates a reluctance to engage in substantive reform discussions, as it invites future attacks and complicates the political dialogue. END OF SUMMARY.
