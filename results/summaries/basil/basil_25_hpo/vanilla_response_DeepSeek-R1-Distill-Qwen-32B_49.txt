Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let's read through it carefully. The article is about the political debate over Medicare between the Romney and Obama campaigns. Romney chose Paul Ryan as his VP, and now they're arguing about who's worse for Medicare. 

The Obama team says Romney's plan would turn Medicare into a voucher system, letting people buy insurance or traditional Medicare. Romney's team counters by saying Obama took $700 billion from Medicare for Obamacare. They quote Reince Priebus saying Obama "stole" that money. 

But wait, the article explains that the $700 billion isn't stolen but comes from limiting the growth of Medicare, mainly by reducing waste in Medicare Advantage. Fact-checkers say the Romney claim is misleading. 

However, the Obama campaign is upset because Republicans used the same argument in 2010, and Obama himself used similar attacks on McCain in 2008, accusing him of cutting Medicare by $800 billion. The article mentions that McCain's plan was about efficiency and slowing growth, not cutting benefits, which FactCheck.org called "false." 

Now, the current debate is making the political discussion more complicated, with both sides accusing each other of harming Medicare. The article ends by noting that this could make it harder to have a substantive discussion about Medicare reform.

So, the summary should cover the main points: the current debate, the $700 billion claim, the fact-checking, the historical context with Obama attacking McCain, and how this history complicates the current discussion. Keep it under 200 words, focus on the key arguments and the historical angle.

Romney's team accuses Obama of "stealing" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while Obama's team argues that the money was used to limit waste and fraud in Medicare Advantage.
