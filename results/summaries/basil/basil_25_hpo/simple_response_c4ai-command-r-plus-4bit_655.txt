SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare reform has intensified following Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee. The Romney campaign has accused Barack Obama of "stealing" $700 billion from Medicare to fund his health care overhaul, a claim disputed by independent fact-checkers. This attack mirrors a similar strategy used by Obama against John McCain in the 2008 election, where he criticized McCain's plan to cut Medicare by $800 billion. However, fact-checkers at the time also disputed Obama's claim, stating that McCain intended to limit waste and slow the rate of growth, not slash benefits. The complex nature of Medicare politics makes it difficult to have an honest discussion about necessary reforms without inviting future attacks. This contributes to a general reluctance to address the issue substantively.
