Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Medicare debate between Obama and Romney. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that after Mitt Romney chose Paul Ryan as his VP, the politics of Medicare got complicated. Both campaigns are accusing each other of harming Medicare benefits. Obama's team points out Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system, while Romney's team says Obama took $700 billion from Medicare for Obamacare.

I remember that the Romney campaign argues Obama "stole" money from Medicare, but the article explains that the savings came from limiting the growth rate, waste, fraud, and abuse, especially in Medicare Advantage. Fact-checkers say Romney's characterization is off.

The article also brings up past instances where similar arguments were made. In 2010, Republicans attacked Obama for raiding Medicare, and Obama himself criticized McCain in 2008 for Medicare cuts, which were actually about reducing waste, not cutting benefits. The article mentions that Obama's ads were rated false because they misrepresented McCain's plan.

Now, in the current debate, both sides are using these past criticisms, which complicates the discussion. The Romney campaign's argument is effective but inaccurate, and it's making the political dialogue more complex.

So, the summary should include the current accusations, the historical context of similar attacks, and how these debates are making the policy discussion more complicated. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise.

I'll start by stating that the Medicare debate is complicated after Romney's VP choice. Then mention both campaigns' accusations. Explain Obama's $700 billion point and Romney's response. Then bring in the historical context with McCain and Obama's past criticisms. Finally, note how this history complicates the current debate.

I should avoid jargon and keep it straightforward. Make sure to include that the Romney argument is disputed by fact-checkers and that the issue is cyclical, making substantive discussions harder.

Let me structure it step by step:

1. Introduction: Romney's VP choice complicates Medicare politics.
2. Current accusations: Romney's voucher plan vs. Obama's $700 billion cut.
3. Romney's response and fact-checkers' stance.
4. Historical context: 2010 attacks and 2008 McCain criticism.
5. Impact on current debate: complicates dialogue, reluctance to discuss reforms.

That should cover all the main points without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare has intensified following Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee. Romney's team accuses Barack Obama of cutting $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while Obama's team points to Romney's plan to transform Medicare into a voucher system. Romney's claim is disputed, as the savings from the Affordable Care Act primarily come from reducing waste and limiting the program's growth rate, not cutting benefits. This accusation echoes past political attacks, such as Republicans criticizing Obama in 2010 and Obama himself targeting John McCain in 2008, falsely claiming McCain's plan would slash Medicare benefits. The historical context highlights a cyclical pattern of political rhetoric, complicating substantive discussions on Medicare reform. END OF SUMMARY.
