Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the political debate over Medicare between the Romney and Obama campaigns. Romney picked Paul Ryan, and now they're fighting over who's worse for Medicare. 

The article mentions that Obama's team is pointing out Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system, where people would get checks to buy insurance. Romney's team is responding by saying Obama took $700 billion from Medicare for Obamacare. They're accusing Obama of stealing money from Medicare. 

I remember that fact-checkers say the $700 billion isn't stolen but comes from limiting growth and reducing waste, especially in Medicare Advantage. So, it's about slowing down the program's growth, not cutting benefits directly. 

The article also brings up past politics. In 2010, Republicans used the same argument against Obama, saying he raided Medicare. Then, in 2008, Obama attacked McCain for cutting Medicare by $800 billion, but it turned out McCain was talking about efficiency and not cutting benefits. 

Now, both sides are using similar arguments, which makes the debate confusing. It's making it hard to have a real discussion about Medicare reform because everyone is worried about being attacked later. 

So, the summary should include the current debate, the $700 billion point, the fact-checkers' take, the historical context with McCain and Obama, and how this is complicating the conversation on Medicare. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the heated political debate over Medicare between the Romney and Obama campaigns. Romney's plan to convert Medicare into a voucher system has sparked criticism from Obama's team, who accuse Romney of threatening seniors' benefits. Romney's team counters by pointing out that Obama's Affordable Care Act cut $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare. Fact-checkers argue the cuts were not "stolen" but resulted from limiting the program's growth and reducing waste, particularly in Medicare Advantage. The article highlights the historical context, noting that Obama previously accused McCain of cutting Medicare by $800 billion, though McCain's plan focused on efficiency rather than benefit cuts. The ongoing debate is complicating substantive discussions about Medicare reform, as both sides exploit the issue for political gain. END OF SUMMARY.
