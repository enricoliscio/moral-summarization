Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without going over 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the 2012 election where Romney and Obama are accusing each other of harming Medicare. Romney's team says Obama stole $700 billion, while Obama's team accuses Romney of cutting benefits. The article also mentions past attacks, like Obama criticizing McCain in 2008.

Next, I'll identify the key morally charged words from the list that are used in the article. Words like "harm," "stole," "fund," "blood," "cut," "higher," "copays," "gamble," "cuts," "pay," "false," "improve," "saving," "provide," "access," "care," "opposed," "identified," "demagogued," "complicate," "contribute" are important.

I need to structure the summary to include these words, showing the accusations and counter-accusations. I should mention how both campaigns are using past criticisms to their advantage, and how this creates a complex political dialogue.

I'll start by stating the main conflict, then detail each side's accusations, include the historical context with McCain, and conclude with the impact on the political discussion. I'll make sure to keep it concise, within 200 words, and include as many moral terms as possible without making it too cluttered.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each point flows logically and the moral framing is clear. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and make sure the summary accurately reflects the article's content while emphasizing the moral aspects.

SUMMARY: The Medicare debate has become a contentious issue in the 2012 election, with both campaigns accusing each other of harming seniors' benefits. Mitt Romney's team argues that Barack Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, claiming this action has "blood on his hands." Meanwhile, Obama's team counters that Romney's plan would cut Medicare benefits by turning it into a voucher program, leading to higher premiums and copays. The Romney campaign's characterization of Obama's actions has sparked intense debate, with fact-checkers disputing the claim that Obama "raided" Medicare. However, the Obama campaign recognizes the political effectiveness of this line, as Republicans used a similar argument in the 2010 elections. The article highlights how both sides have historically accused each other of cutting Medicare funds, with Obama previously attacking John McCain's plan as a $800 billion "gamble" on seniors' health care. The political dialogue is further complicated by the use of these morally charged accusations, which risk overshadowing substantive discussions about Medicare reform. END OF SUMMARY.
