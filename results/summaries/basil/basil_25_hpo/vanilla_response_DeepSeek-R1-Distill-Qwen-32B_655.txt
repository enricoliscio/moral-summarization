Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Medicare debate between Obama and Romney. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by explaining that after Romney chose Paul Ryan as his VP, Medicare politics got complicated. The main issue is whether Romney or Obama is worse for Medicare benefits.

Obama's team accuses Romney of wanting to turn Medicare into a voucher system, where people would buy their own insurance or stick with traditional Medicare. Romney's team counters by saying Obama took $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare. They quote RNC Chair Reince Priebus saying Obama "stole" that money.

But the article explains that the $700 billion isn't taken directly; it's from limiting the growth of the program, mainly by cutting waste and fraud in Medicare Advantage. The savings help fund the ACA. Fact-checkers and analysts say Romney's claim is misleading.

The article also brings up past instances where similar arguments were used. In 2010, Republicans attacked Obama for raiding Medicare, and in 2008, Obama criticized McCain for cutting Medicare by $800 billion. The truth was that McCain wanted to limit waste, not cut benefits, and the attack was based on a Wall Street Journal article.

Now, with Romney's VP pick, the debate is heating up again. The article points out that both sides have used these arguments before, making the current dialogue more complex and less likely to focus on real reforms because of the fear of future attacks.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll highlight the key points: Romney's choice of Ryan, the accusations from both sides about Medicare funding, the misleading nature of Romney's claim, the historical context of similar attacks, and the impact on the current debate.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the current situation, then the accusations, the fact-checking, historical context, and the effect on the political dialogue. Keep it concise and clear.

SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare has intensified following Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee. Romney's team accuses President Obama of "stealing" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, a claim Obama's team disputes, arguing the savings come from reducing waste and fraud in the program. Romney's campaign has used this accusation to criticize Obama, while Obama's team highlights Romney's plan to convert Medicare into a voucher system. The issue has historical roots: in 2008, Obama criticized John McCain for proposing $800 billion in Medicare cuts, though McCain's plan focused on limiting waste rather than cutting benefits. Similarly, Romney's campaign has been accused of misleadingly framing the issue. The ongoing debate is complicating efforts to engage in substantive discussions about Medicare reform, as both sides focus on attacking each other's records. END OF SUMMARY.
