Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the debate over Medicare between Romney, Obama, and McCain, focusing on accusations of cutting benefits and funding through vouchers or taxes.

I should start by outlining the key arguments from each side. Romney's team accuses Obama of stealing $700 billion from Medicare, which they say harms seniors. Obama's team counters by pointing out Romney's voucher plan as harmful. 

I need to include words like "harm," "stole," "fund," "blood," "cuts," "fraud," "abuse," and "savings." I'll mention how both sides use these terms to accuse each other. 

I should also touch on the historical context, like how Obama attacked McCain with similar accusations. This adds depth to the moral framing, showing a pattern of using Medicare as a political tool.

I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows logically. Each sentence should highlight the moral language without getting bogged down in details. 

Finally, I'll conclude by noting how these accusations complicate the dialogue on Medicare reform, using words like "complicate" and "contribute." This ties back to the broader impact of their arguments.

Putting it all together, the summary should capture the essence of the moral debate, using the specified words to convey the tensions and accusations between the candidates.

SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare has intensified as Mitt Romney and Barack Obama accuse each other of harming the program. Romney's team claims Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, arguing this action has "blood on his hands." Obama's team counters by highlighting Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system, which they say would "cut" benefits and lead to "higher" premiums and "copays." The Romney campaign argues that Obama's Affordable Care Act "limited" Medicare's growth by "eliminating" waste and "abuse," particularly in Medicare Advantage, to "subsidize" insurance for others. Independent fact-checkers have disputed Romney's characterization, but the accusation remains politically effective. This mirrors a similar attack Obama used against John McCain in 2008, accusing him of "cutting" Medicare by $800 billion. McCain's team argued the savings would come from "reforming" payment policies and "eliminating" fraud, not "cutting" benefits. Now, as Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, supports similar "cuts," the debate over Medicare's future grows more "complicated," with both sides accusing each other of "harm" and "fraud." The moral framing of "stealing," "blood," and "cuts" dominates the discourse, complicating substantive discussions on reform. END OF SUMMARY.
