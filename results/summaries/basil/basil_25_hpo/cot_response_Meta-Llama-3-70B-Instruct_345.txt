SUMMARY:
The debate over Medicare has become complicated after Mitt Romney chose Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee. The Romney campaign accused President Obama of "stealing" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, saying he has "blood on his hands" in regards to the program. However, independent fact-checkers and news analysts have disputed this characterization, noting that the savings come from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse. The Obama campaign has responded by pointing to the Republican plan to turn Medicare into a quasi-voucher program, which they claim would do more harm to people's benefits. The debate has become intense, with both sides accusing each other of "demagoguing" the issue. The Romney campaign's attack is reminiscent of Obama's own criticism of John McCain's health care plan in 2008, which was rated "false" by FactCheck.org. The back-and-forth has made it difficult to have a substantive discussion about Medicare reform. END OF SUMMARY.
