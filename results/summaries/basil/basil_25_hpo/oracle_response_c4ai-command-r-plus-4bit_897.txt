SUMMARY: The debate over Medicare reform has become increasingly heated, with both the Romney and Obama campaigns accusing each other of harming seniors' benefits. The Romney campaign has criticized Obama for taking $700 billion out of Medicare to fund the Affordable Care Act, a claim that independent fact-checkers have disputed. This line of attack mirrors a similar strategy used by Obama against McCain in the 2008 election, where he accused McCain of planning to cut Medicare by $800 billion. While the Obama campaign cries foul, they know the effectiveness of such a message, as it was used successfully against them in the 2010 congressional elections. The truth is more nuanced, with the Affordable Care Act limiting the growth of Medicare and targeting waste, fraud, and abuse to generate savings. The political dialogue surrounding Medicare is further complicated by the reluctance of both campaigns to fully specify their plans for reform, which could invite future attacks and contribute to a general lack of substantive discussion on the issue.
END OF SUMMARY.
