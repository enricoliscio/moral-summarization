SUMMARY:
The Medicare debate has become complicated in the wake of Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee. The Romney campaign claims that Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, saying he has "blood on his hands" in regard to Medicare. However, independent fact-checkers and news analysts have disputed this characterization, pointing out that the savings come from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse. The Obama campaign is "crying foul" over this line of criticism, which may be because it knows how effective it can be. Republicans used a similar attack line in the 2010 congressional elections. Meanwhile, Obama's past criticism of John McCain's health care plan is being revisited, with some arguing that it was "false" and an "assault" on McCain's Medicare record. The debate has become mired in accusations of "demagoguery" and "refusal" to specify how to pay for health care plans. END OF SUMMARY.
