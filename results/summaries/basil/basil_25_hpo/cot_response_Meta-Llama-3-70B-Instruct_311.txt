SUMMARY:
The politics of Medicare have become complicated after Mitt Romney chose Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee. The Romney campaign accused Obama of "stealing" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, saying he has "blood on his hands." However, independent fact-checkers disputed this claim, pointing out that the savings come from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse. The Obama campaign cried "foul" over this line of criticism, which they know can be effective. In 2008, Obama used similar language to attack John McCain's health care plan, accusing him of making "drastic cuts" to Medicare. However, FactCheck.org rated the ad as "false," noting that McCain's plan aimed to eliminate waste and reform payment policies. The current debate over Medicare proposals has become a moral battleground, with both sides accusing each other of "demagoguing" the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
