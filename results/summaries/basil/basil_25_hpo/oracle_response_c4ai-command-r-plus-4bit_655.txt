SUMMARY: In the wake of Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate, the politics of Medicare have become increasingly complex and contentious. The Romney campaign has accused President Obama of "stealing" $700 billion from Medicare to fund his health care overhaul, a claim that independent fact-checkers have disputed. This line of attack mirrors a strategy used by Obama against Senator John McCain in the 2008 election, where he criticized McCain's plan to cut Medicare by $800 billion, potentially harming benefits for seniors. However, the Obama campaign is now pushing back, arguing that their savings were achieved by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse, and improving benefits for seniors. This complex back-and-forth highlights the challenges of discussing Medicare reform without inviting political attacks and complicating the dialogue. It also underscores the reluctance of both parties to fully specify their plans for paying for proposed changes or cuts to the program, which could harm seniors' access to vital health care services.
