SUMMARY: 
The Medicare debate between the Obama and Romney campaigns has become morally charged and complicated. The Romney campaign accused Obama of "stealing" $700 billion from Medicare to fund his health care plan, an attack that independent fact-checkers have disputed. The Obama campaign, in turn, cried "foul," knowing the effectiveness of such accusations, as demonstrated by Obama's previous attacks on McCain's Medicare plans during the 2008 election. Obama's campaign criticized McCain for planning to "cut" Medicare by $800 billion and "gamble" with seniors' health care. These attacks, deemed "false" by fact-checkers, were part of a broader assault on McCain's Medicare record, which included criticisms of his proposal to tax worker health care plans. The current debate over Medicare, filled with morally framed language, may further complicate the political dialogue and increase reluctance to engage in substantive Medicare reform. END OF SUMMARY.
