Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the debate over Medicare between Romney and Obama, with accusations of cutting benefits and funding plans. Romney's team accuses Obama of stealing money from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while Obama's team points out Romney's plan to voucherize Medicare.

I need to highlight the key moral terms like "harm," "stole," "fund," "blood," etc. I'll structure the summary to show both sides' accusations, using the moral language to frame each argument. I should mention the specific amounts, like the $700 billion and $800 billion cuts, and the accusations of stealing or raiding funds.

I also need to include the fact-checking part, where independent sources dispute the Romney campaign's claims. It's important to note that both sides have used similar tactics in past campaigns, which adds context to the moral framing.

Finally, I'll wrap it up by mentioning how this debate complicates the dialogue on Medicare reform, using terms like "complicate" and "contribute." I'll keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral terms effectively.

SUMMARY:  
The Medicare debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama has intensified, with both sides accusing the other of harming seniors' benefits. Romney's team claims Obama "stole" $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare, while Obama's team argues Romney's plan would voucherize Medicare, shifting costs to beneficiaries. The Romney campaign's rejoinder focuses on the $700 billion cut from Medicare under the Affordable Care Act, which they claim "raided" the program to fund Obama's health care overhaul. Independent fact-checkers dispute this characterization, noting the savings came from limiting waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare Advantage, not cutting benefits. Obama, however, has history using similar language, accusing John McCain in 2008 of planning $800 billion in Medicare cuts. Romney's team now opposes Obama's savings, accusing him of "demagoguing" the issue. The debate highlights the political complexity of Medicare reform, with both sides framing the issue as a moral fight over seniors' health care. The use of terms like "cut," "fund," "stole," and "harm" underscores the emotional stakes, while the focus on "fraud," "abuse," and "savings" reflects competing visions for the program's future. END OF SUMMARY.
