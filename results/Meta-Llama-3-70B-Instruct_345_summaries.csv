mpqa_39,mpqa,"Tehran, Dec 9, IRNA -- Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) on Sunday expressed concern about return of the period in which force and weapon had the last say in international relations.

The IHRC said in a statement to mark December 10, ""international day for human rights"" that the international community has formulated numerous documents to honor human rights after 50 years of bitter experience and the heavy losses that the humanity has suffered.

The statement said that several hundred documents have been signed to promote human rights and different cultures have put forward their outlooks about human rights and envisaged measures to stop violation of human rights.

The IHRC called for prohibition of discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention and honoring the human rights, political rights, the rights of associations, the women's rights as well as the rights envisaged in the international declaration for human rights as recommended by the divine religions several centuries ago.

The statement regretted that provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been materialized.
""The human communities have suffered heavy human losses in the course of devastating world wars and understood that any progress in human communities is dependent on honoring the human rights,"" it said.

The IHRC said that the international conference against racism in Durban, South Africa August 31-September 7, 2001 was a turning point in the international campaign to honor human rights.

The statement deplored the injustice against the Palestinian nation and violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, the religious minorities, the children and women in some parts of the world.

The IHRC said that all nations and religions condemned the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.
The solidarity would bring about an international campaign to dry up the roots of terrorism and expand peace and security in the international community, but, certain countries resort to military power and embark on trampling upon human rights of civilians.

mpqa_30,mpqa,"HARARE -- Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from some areas of the drought-ravaged country as punishment for not voting the correct way in March's election.

Mr. Tsvangirai, the 50-year-old leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, alleged in an interview that a starvation policy is part of a major campaign of retribution the ruling ZANU-PF has waged against him and his supporters.

He also spoke about the support his country's opposition movement has received from abroad, and his pending trial on treason charges, both issues with Canadian connections.
But he focused on the violence and hunger that have plagued many Zimbabweans since the controversial presidential election, at least in part a state-orchestrated operation aimed at crushing the opposition, he said.

""I feel very strongly for these people,"" Mr. Tsvangirai said.
""This is just the pursuance of a vendetta.
The situation has escalated wildly since the election.
It's part of Mugabe's grand strategy to target the MDC's supporter base.""

He said the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition to ZANU-PF is strongest.

""The first targets are the farmers and their workers, then rural-area sympathizers,"" he said.

The United Nations World Food Program warned last week that as many as 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation from the drought, compounded by government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms that have crippled production of maize and wheat.
Ground corn, known locally as ""mealie meal,"" is the staple diet of millions of Zimbabweans who can afford little else.

Mr. Mugabe acknowledged the country's agricultural problems last week, declaring a ""state of disaster"" brought on by drought and sabotage by white farmers.
He made no reference to the economic upheaval caused by the farm invasions, but the government says it is trying to import supplies from South Africa, China, Argentina and Brazil.

Because of restrictions on foreign reporters in Zimbabwe, it was impossible to obtain direct government comment on Mr. Tsvangirai's allegations.
But non-governmental organizations operating in the country also said they have been seeing evidence of discriminatory food distribution.

""Food is now a major issue,"" said Shari Eppel of Amani Trust, a human-rights organization.
"". . . We have come across cases of people having to have a ZANU-PF card before they are allowed to buy from the Grain Marketing Board,"" which is the body that controls imports and sales.

In the southwestern region of Matabeleland, for example, cases have been reported where people had to go through a ""cleansing"" routine to purge them of their MDC sympathies before being allowed to buy corn.

""According to reports we have received, they are taken to the police to denounce the MDC, then to the war veterans, where they go through a public confession,"" Mrs. Eppel said.
""Then they are taken to the local headman to be kept under observation.
After a few days, he decides if they can be allowed to buy grain from the GMB.""

Meanwhile, Mr. Tsvangirai alleged, the land-reform plan, nominally launched to resettle one million poor families, is actually putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and members of the ruling party elite.

He said beneficiaries of the program have included government ministers, MPs, army and police officials -- even Mr. Mugabe's in-laws.

""The situation we see now is what I call the Last Supper -- it is ZANU-PF's final feast,"" Mr. Tsvangirai said.
""It is a case of take what you can while you can. ""

The opposition leader commended Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mr. Mugabe's regime.
But he said Zimbabwe's future rests largely with its own people.

""The international community can support us so far, but it can never remove the shackles of repression,"" he said.
""The burden really lies with Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for their own freedom.""

He said the violence, hunger and economic turmoil are strengthening his country's appetite for a public campaign for change.

""There is no struggle without casualties, but we don't want to engineer any reckless action,"" he cautioned.
"". . . A systematic, strategic program of mass mobilization is necessary to confront a stolen victory and an illegitimate government.""

Mr. Tsvangirai also touched on his own legal battle with the government: On May 31, he is to stand trial on a charge of treason, accused of plotting to have Mr. Mugabe assassinated.

The opposition leader has denied the charge all along, and although he was reluctant to go into depth about a case still before the courts, he did make brief reference to the prosecution's star witness, Montreal-based consultant and former Israeli intelligence agent Ari Ben-Menashe, who may or may not travel to Zimbabwe for the trial.

""If the prosecution's key witness is reluctant to testify, how will they proceed?
"" Mr. Tsvangirai asked.
""There is no case to answer.""","Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has accused President Robert Mugabe of withholding food from areas that did not vote for him in the March election, as part of a campaign of retribution against his supporters.

mpqa_69,mpqa,"Environmentalist groups staged a protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo on Sunday prior to President George W. Bush's arrival in the capital.

About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) opposed to the U.S. alternative to the 1997 pact gathered around 1 p.m.
at Tameike-Sanno Station, close to the embassy in Tokyo's Minato Ward.

""We cannot accept it by any means.
It is very regrettable that the United States has taken a negative stand,"" Masaaki Nakajima of Friends of the Earth (FoE) Japan said.

Protesters carried banners reading, ""Ratify the Kyoto Protocol,"" and ""Koizumi say 'No' to Bush: Stick to Kyoto Protocol.""

The demonstration came amid heightened security around the embassy as well as elsewhere in Tokyo for the president's visit.

Representatives of the NGOs including Kiko Network, Peace Boat and FoE Japan handed a letter addressed to Bush to a guard at the embassy.

In the letter, the NGOs said, ""We, Japanese environmental NGOs concerned about climate change, were terribly dismayed by your new climate change plan.""

On Thursday, Bush unveiled the new plan that calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies in accordance with economic growth instead of mandatory reduction targets.

Bush sparked international outcry when he rejected the Kyoto Protocol last March, saying it would mean sacrificing U.S. economic growth.

""We think this plan cannot be an 'alternative' to Kyoto Protocol because it would allow the current greenhouse gas emissions of the United States to increase by around 30% compared to 1990 level in 2010,"" the letter said.

""We demand of you, Mr. President, to reconsider your climate policy plan immediately and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol.
The Kyoto Protocol is the only existing international framework to prevent dangerous climate change,"" it added.

Measures to tackle global warming will be among the main issues Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Bush will discuss when they meet Monday in Tokyo, according to Japanese and U.S. officials.

Kiko Network also sent an e-mail message to Koizumi urging the premier to call on Bush to return to the Kyoto Protocol at an early stage and to inform him of Japan's plan to ratify the Kyoto Protocol after the Diet approves ratification during the current Diet session.

Meanwhile, Peace Boat also handed a separate letter addressed to the president to the guard, calling on the U.S. to take leadership in helping developing countries through ""peaceful dialogue and fair economic support.""

In reference to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington last year, the letter said, ""Don't push the Japanese government or any other government to cooperate in your 'war against terrorism'.""

It also called on the U.S. to stop all air raids on Afghanistan, cease nuclear experiments and reduce U.S. military bases in Japan, among other requests.","Environmental groups in Japan staged a protest against the US alternative to the Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming near the US Embassy in Tokyo on Sunday.

mpqa_42,mpqa,"Islamabad, March 6, IRNA -- Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul on Wednesday rejected this year's US State Department report on human rights, saying it was ""a pack of blatant lies and propaganda.""
A former director-general of the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Hameed Gul told IRNA in an interview here that each country which resisted American hegemony was deemed a violator of human rights.
""In a fit of force, the US wanted to subjugate the entire world community and was not ready to tolerate any hurdle in this direction and the recent report on human rights was also a manifestation of its hegemonistic designs,"" the lieutenant general (retd) continued.
Hameed Gul was of the opinion that the US was the only country in the world that had no respect for any religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights and rules.
""It is unprecedented in the history of the comity of nations that the US forcibly wanted to prevent countries from upholding religious and cultural values,"" he said.
""The US is the most fraudulent, terrorist and extremist country.
The world would never forget the barbarities it committed on the innocent Afghan people, women, children and the elderly,"" he firmly said.
In order to realize its vested interests in the region, he said the US and its allies unleashed oppression against the Afghan people and used latest weaponry against the defenseless nation.
In this regard, he made a quick reference to the ongoing killings of Indian Muslims.
""Since the rioting erupted last week, over 600 people, mostly Muslims, have been brutally murdered in the hands of extremist Hindus in India, but the US and other so-called civilized nations kept a shameful mum,"" he remarked.
The Americans, he pointed out, see violations of human rights when a country or a group of people become hurdles in the realization of their vested interests.
""What Israel is doing in Palestine against the Muslims is also one of the worst examples of rights abuses but the US is again silent, but when Palestinians react to Israeli attacks America is quick to The logical solution to the Palestinian issue is a free and independent state for the people of Palestine as enshrined under UN resolutions, he said.
But the US is denying this, he added.
He said it clearly means that the Muslims have no right to defend themsleves against their oppressors.
""America wants total submission of Muslims across the globe,"" Hameed Gul said.
""The situation requires a concerted moral resistance by Muslims scholars; if they remain indifferent to each other's plight in the hands of imperialist forces led by the US, they would be crushed one by one,"" he warned.

mpqa_37,mpqa,"US human rights report termed inaccurate

ISLAMABAD, March 5: The government on Tuesday rejected the US State Department Report on human rights as ""factually inaccurate and unwarranted"" adding that it reflected tendency of some states to sit in judgment on others.

""The reports fails to acknowledge the important policy measures and initiatives by the government of Pakistan to promote and protect human rights,"" said a statement issued by Foreign Office spokesman in which the report was termed as factually inaccurate and unwarranted.

It pointed out that all the goals set at an April 2000 human rights conference had been achieved, which it added had been ignored by the report.

Enlisting these initiatives, it recalled that these include promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, national policy and plan of action for elimination of child labour and establishment of a fund for rehabilitation of working children.

The government, it added, has amended Pakistan Citizenship Act of 1951 to enable women of Pakistani descent to claim Pakistani nationality for their children born to foreign husbands.

A mass awareness campaign was launched as part of the observance of the Year 2000 as the year of Human Rights and Human Dignity, it added.

In addition, it said, Pakistan also ratified ILO Conventions 100 on equal remuneration and 182 on the elimination of worst forms of child labour.

It signed the Optional Protocols to Convention on the Rights of Child.

Recently the system of joint electorates has been introduced respecting the wishes of the minority communities, it said.

Despite these developments, the report states ""the government's human rights record remained poor.""

""This is unacceptable and a gross misstatement of the facts.

The government of Pakistan therefore, feels constrained to reject the assessment of the report about Pakistan, and the tendency of some states to sit in judgment over others.""

""The cause of human rights would be better served if all states, in a spirit of cooperation and understanding address the problems they face in promoting and protecting human rights,"" it said.","The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it ""factually inaccurate and unwarranted"".

Despite these achievements, the report states that the government's human rights record remained poor, which is deemed an unacceptable misstatement of facts. The government urges that the cause of human rights would be better served if all states address their problems in promoting and protecting human rights in a spirit of cooperation and understanding, rather than sitting in judgment over others."
mpqa_41,mpqa,"United Nations, November 14 (XINHUA) -- It was unrealistic to envisage that people who were suffering from lack of development, poverty, hunger and poor health could fully enjoy their human rights, several delegations stressed Wednesday to the Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian, Cultural) of the 56th UN General Assembly.

The committee Wednesday opened a formal debate on human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Representatives said that the right to development was one of two major preconditions to ensure the universal protection and promotion of human rights, a press release of the committee said.

""The second crucial element, maintaining international peace and security, was also emphasized as the Committee continued its debate on human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms,"" it said.

Briefing on the remarks by the representative of Thailand, it said: ""Human rights and development were two sides of the same coin, and should be addressed in tandem.""

""People should be at the center of social and economic development efforts.
They had to be protected from other scourges and social ills, including disease, narcotic drugs, armed conflicts, terrorism and other types of transnational organized crime,"" it added.

The representative of Eritrea said globalization was not only threatening to further marginalize the developing world and alienate its masses, it was also hampering the ability to exercise the rights and duties enshrined in numerous international human rights instruments, including the right to development.

""Narrowing the development gap between countries was crucial to the realization of universal human rights,"" said the representative of China Shen Guofang.
""Underdevelopment had seriously hindered the capacity of developing countries to protect and promote human rights.""

""With the rapid spread of globalization and economic expansion, the situation for poor countries was deteriorating with each passing day,"" Shen said.

The representative of the United States said that despite the horrors of the terrorist attack, the international community could not truly win the war against terrorism unless human rights were protected.

""There could be no expediency, no compromise, no lapse in vigilance,"" he said.
""Promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy throughout the world was an integral part of the multilateral war on terrorism"".

Also speaking on the debate were the representatives of Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece and Indonesia.

mpqa_34,mpqa,"China criticizes US human rights report

BEIJING - China issued its annual report on human rights in the United States on Monday, accusing Washington of turning a blind eye to abuses in its own land while criticizing other countries for theirs.

The report by the Information Office of the State Council, China's Cabinet, listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, racial discrimination and lack of personal safety in the United States, the official Xinhua news agency said.

It also accused Washington of ""wantonly infringing"" on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and stationing US forces overseas, Xinhua said.

The report also slammed US President George W. Bush's administration for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gases.

China releases the report every year in response to a US State Department report on global human rights conditions, which usually accuses China of widespread abuses.

The US report came out last week.

mpqa_26,mpqa,"Tokyo irked by US stance on Kyoto

TOKYO - Coral reefs will die from water that's too hot.

Polar bears will have less room to roam, crowding some of them out of existence.

Birds will start flying an extra mile north each year, and may starve when they get there.

These are among the dire possible consequences of global warming, say climate-change experts.

At no time was it clearer that countries should take steps to slow this process than when 150 countries signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997.

But now, with President George Bush saying the US will not ratify the protocol - which was shaped in part to fit Washington's concerns five years ago - the accord's ultimate effectiveness is in doubt, and many US allies are irritated.

For Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, the shaping of the accord on their soil was a source of pride - and proof that they were still relevant players on the world stage.

""It is absolutely inadmissible for the US, which is the greatest gas-emitting country, to once again turn its back and present something that is against Kyoto Protocol and the framework convention on climate change,"" says Mie Asaoka, president of the Kiko Network, a Tokyo environmental-umbrella organization representing about 150 Japanese groups.

The clash over how to stop global warming while allowing sluggish economies to prosper occurs at an awkward point in US-Japanese relations.

US analysts looking east say that as Japan's economic dominance in Asia diminishes, so will the importance of the US-Japan relationship as a whole.

The US Department of Defense recently left Japan off its list of nations contributing to the post-Sept. 11 war on terror.

Realizing the accidental slight, the US later apologized for overlooking Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's efforts - considered tremendously ambitious here - to alter the interpretation of Japan's post-World War II pacifist constitution in order to dispatch warships for noncombat support.

During Mr. Bush's visit here last month, Mr. Koizumi gently balked at the president's proposed alternative to the Kyoto agreement, saying that Japan would ""like to see further efforts"" on the part of the US.

While there are no protesters in the streets, there is an air of indignation here over Washington's ""do-it-our-way"" decision on something that effects the whole globe.

Among the Kiko Network's handouts is a pamphlet with a cartoon of the world.

On one end, Koizumi defensively holds up the Kyoto Protocol.

On the other, a fiendish-looking Bush seizes a weeping globe in his monster-size hands.

In the eyes of Japan and many US allies, the Bush administration's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol is one of many signals that Washington is growing increasingly unilateralist in the six months since the Sept. 11 attacks on America.

From pulling out of Kyoto - which is in the process of being ratified by the European Union - to labeling Iran, Iraq, and North Korea an ""axis of evil"" and prime targets in the next phase of the war, America's allies are seeing in the US a growing tendency to act first and consult later.

The Bush administration is offering its own alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, which aides say are more market-sensitive and will reduce the worst air pollutants by 70 percent while finding a strategy to cut greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent over the next 10 years.

But environmental advocates say Bush's alternative will allow the US to continue to increase the amount of gas it emits.

They fear that, because the US is forging its own way, smaller nations that are expected to ratify the Kyoto Protocol could start backing out.

This could lead to a two-tier system in which the US and a few others - Australia and Canada may follow suit - will choose their own targets, while the rest of the world will be limited to the stricter Kyoto limits.

Not everyone in Japan is upset with Bush's alternative.

Japanese industry has already gone through vigorous energy-saving - and thus environmentally friendly - drives after the two energy crises of the 1970s and 1980s, says Mitsuru Shinozaki, a spokesman for Keidanren, the country's most influential business lobby.

After the Earth Summit of 10 years ago, he says, Japan discussed and implemented a self-action plan to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions.

""Any further policy to reduce emissions,"" he says ""will hurt Japanese industrial competitiveness.""","The US's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol has sparked frustration in Japan, a nation proud of its role in shaping the accord. Climate-change experts warn of dire consequences, including coral reef destruction, polar bear extinction, and bird migration disruptions, if global warming is not addressed. Japan's environmental groups are outraged, seeing the US's stance as unilateralist and detrimental to the global effort. The US's alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, is criticized for allowing continued gas emission increases. Japan's industry, however, is more receptive to the US plan, citing existing energy-saving measures and concerns about competitiveness.

mpqa_29,mpqa,"WHAT THEY SAID: No tears for Tobin, but some for al-Qaeda

OTTAWA - The plight of prisoners and politicians has been weighing heavily on the minds of editorial writers and pundits in and around the nation's capital.

It's been a week now since Jean Chretien's Cabinet shuffle and the dramatic departure of Brian Tobin -- seven days during which the print pundits have had time to ponder his actions.

And what they have said about him has not been pretty.

Still, before discussing the antics of Mr. Tobin and the elevation of Ottawa's John Manley to the status of golden boy, there is the controversial, and more pressing, matter of the plight of the al-Qaeda fighters imprisoned at a U.S. military base in Cuba.

""Even thugs deserve humane treatment,"" reads the headline of the Ottawa Citizen editorial.

""Conditions for detainees in Guantanamo Bay are harsh: wire-mesh cells 2.4 by 1.8 metres, a sleeping mat and blanket, a bucket for a toilet,"" writes the Citizen.

""But that doesn't necessarily make them inhumane.

On the other hand, U.S. assurances that it's treating the prisoners humanely don't mean that's so.""

The Citizen argues that Canada should ""insist"" the United States ""allow a 'competent tribunal' to decide the legal status of the detainees, as required by the Geneva Convention.

... That might make it more difficult to find Osama bin Laden and his remaining thugs.

But laws keep us from behaving like them.""

The Sudbury Star agrees: ""This conflict must now move to its next stage.

A tribunal, formed by the United Nations, must address the issue of these captured fighters and determine how they will be dealt with.""

Editorial writers at The Daily Press in Timmins disagree.

In an editorial appearing this week, the newspaper is unequivocal in its U.S. support.

""We can't help but wonder if some politicians and civil rights advocates are overreacting when it comes to the treatment of captured al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters by the United States.

""For the U.S. military to treat the prisoners any differently might very well imperil American lives,"" reads the editorial.

""If Osama bin Laden is still alive, we suspect he is giving the civil rights advocates a hearty thumbs up.""

No one, however, is giving a hearty thumbs up to Mr. Tobin.

Rather, his sudden departure from politics provoked much criticism.

""No tears will be shed in this corner since Brian Tobin's departure represents his third consecutive betrayal of voters,"" Walter Robinson, federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and a regular columnist in The Ottawa Sun wrote yesterday.

""Mr. Tobin seems content to be back home on the Rock playing with his bag of marbles and collecting his parliamentary pension.""

In the Citizen, columnist Rosa Harris-Adler wrote a devastatingly sarcastic piece, ridiculing Mr. Tobin's assertion that he was leaving for family reasons.

She chronicles what she imagines his first week post-politics would have been like:

""Day One: Brian decides it's finally time to learn how to diaper the baby.

With some effort, he pins the flailing child down on the changing table only to discover there are no diapers in the house.

Brian gives up in confusion.""

By Day Seven, however, Ms. Harris-Adler notes that though Mr. Tobin has finally mastered the diapering process, his ""baby"" who is 15 years old is ""not amused.""

And Michel Vastel, a columnist in Le Droit, writes a goodbye to his ""favourite Newfie.""

He says that Mr. Tobin walked on too many toes, and made too many enemies in Ottawa.

He also wrote that while the former minister may have been one of the longest-serving MPs, he was also one of the most ""unstable,"" noting his career was like a ""rough sea,"" with highs and lows and never calm.

The vitriol continues.

In The Kingston Whig-Standard Paul Schliesmann writes, ""Canadians don't need the kind of politician Brian Tobin had become -- flighty, opportunistic and lacking in commitment to his job as a Member of Parliament.""

The pundits in Ottawa, it seems, have saved all of their praise for John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister and a hometown favourite.

""[Mr. Manley] has proven to be a sensible manager who Canadians can trust,"" says a Sun editorial, observing that he emerged from the Sept. 11 crisis as a ""sensible, serious voice in Cabinet."" And the Citizen calls Mr. Manley ""competent and scrupulously honest.""

""Mr. Manley's continuing responsibility for national security, along with the added clout he gains as Deputy Prime Minister, bodes well for the country.""","Editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa have been discussing the plight of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the departure of Brian Tobin from politics.

However, some disagree, saying that treating the prisoners too leniently could put American lives at risk.

mpqa_60,mpqa,"Many fear violence after Zimbabwe vote

HARARE, Zimbabwe Wellington Chinyama sat down in a barber's chair, unfolded his newspaper and without glancing up asked the young man trimming his hair the question that seems to be on virtually everyone's mind here: ""So Joseph, have you prepared yourself for Zimbabwe's civil war?""

As Zimbabweans go to the polls this weekend to re-elect or oust Robert Mugabe, the only leader the country has ever known, the question of who will win the election seems almost secondary to how the loser and his followers will respond.

Surveys show the challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, a trade union leader, ahead of Mugabe.

But a surge in political violence and accusations that the governing party changed election laws to rig the vote have fanned widespread concerns among Zimbabweans, election monitors and foreign diplomats that neither political party nor their supporters are prepared to accept the final tally.

""It does not take a vivid imagination to envision a scenario on the ground where either rioters or the military take to the streets in the days to come,"" an African diplomat said.

Most disturbing are pronouncements by senior government officials and military leaders that they would not allow this former British colony to be led by Tsvangirai and his political party, the Movement for Democratic Change.

In a television interview broadcast the other day, Didymus Mutasa, a spokesman for Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party, said that he and other veterans of the country's independence war found the prospect of a Tsvangirai government intolerable.

""People have said being ruled by the MDC is being ruled by Ian Smith,"" Mutasa said, referring to the prime minister of white-ruled Rhodesia, as the country was known before gaining independence in 1980.

""Under these circumstances, if there were to be a coup, we would support it very definitely.""

At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, almost all of them supporters of the Movement for Democratic Change.

State Department officials this week accused Mugabe's government of numerous human rights violations during the election campaign, an allegation vehemently denied by ZANU-PF officials.

A newspaper reported that Mugabe had put the armed forces on ""high alert"" and had recalled soldiers from neighboring Congo, where they have been deployed in that country's civil war.

Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri denied the reports.

Many Zimbabweans see this weekend's election as a contest between immovable forces: a 78-year-old autocrat desperate to remain in power and an opposition party dominated by restless young citizens weary of government corruption, food shortages and unemployment.

""If Mugabe announces that he has won the election, I think that people will not believe it and will storm the castle,"" said Sibongile Mbuyiso, an opposition supporter.

""But if the MDC wins, I believe Mugabe will announce martial law, throw Tsvangirai in jail for plotting to kill him and send the army into the streets.""

Government officials last month charged Tsvangirai and two other officials of his party with high treason for allegedly plotting to assassinate Mugabe.

That charge is based largely on a heavily edited videotape in which Tsvangirai refers to the ""elimination"" of Mugabe.

Tsvangirai was responding to a question posed by a Canadian publicist with whom he was meeting and who subsequently signed a contract with ZANU-PF.

Political analysts say the charges may have laid the groundwork for Mugabe to jail Tsvangirai as a last-ditch effort to stay in power should he lose the election.

But that outcome is certainly not a foregone conclusion.

Opposition officials say that 22 of their polling agents have been abducted in the past week, and a surge in violent attacks in swing districts could persuade enough opposition supporters to vote for ZANU-PF to ensure Mugabe's victory.

In addition, governing party officials have revised election laws and procedures in a manner that could change the outcome of the vote, according to independent election observers.

ZANU-PF officials have told election observers that they intend to increase the number of polling stations in rural areas believed to be their strongholds and reduce the number of stations in urban areas, where there is strong support for the opposition.

Observers say that could produce long voting lines and discourage some Tsvangirai supporters from casting ballots.

ZANU-PF election officials also plan to use civil service employees to monitor the vote-counting and bar independent monitors from nonprofit organizations from assisting in such routine tasks as transporting ballot boxes to counting stations.

A residency requirement introduced last month bans registered voters from casting ballots if they cannot provide leases or utility bills in their names.

That, according to foreign diplomats and Tsvangirai supporters, could disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of young opposition supporters who live with their parents.

""Clearly, Mugabe is doing everything he can to steal this election,"" said John Makumbe, a political science professor at the University of Zimbabwe.

Tsvangirai said at a news conference Thursday night that if he won the election, he would not prosecute Mugabe.

That could ease pressure on Mugabe to remain in power to avoid prosecution for his government's attack in the 1980s in Matabeleland, the home of the Ndebele tribe, which at the time posed the most significant threat to his leadership.

An estimate of the number of people killed in the operation ranges from 10,000 to 20,000.","Zimbabweans are bracing for potential violence after the country's presidential election this weekend.

basil_5_hpo,basil,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Leaders of the country's largest civil rights organization accused tea party activists on Tuesday of tolerating bigotry and approved a resolution condemning racism within the political movement.

The resolution was adopted during the annual convention in Kansas City of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, spokesman Chris Fleming said.
Tea party organizers disputed claims of racism and called on the NAACP to withdraw the resolution.

Debate was mostly closed to the public, but the final version ""calls on the tea party and all people of good will to repudiate the racist element and activities within the tea party,"" said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau.

""I hope it will empower the tea party to actually look at itself and see that there are those who are noticing things that I think most tea partiers don't want,"" he said.

Sarah Palin, a vocal tea party supporter, said in a statement late Tuesday that she was ""saddened by the NAACP's claim that patriotic Americans ... are somehow 'racists.'""
The former Alaska governor said claims that tea party activists ""judge people by the color of their skin"" were false and appalling.

The final wording won't be released until the NAACP's national board of directors approves the resolution during its meeting in October.
But the original called for the NAACP to ""educate its membership and the community that this movement is not just about higher taxes and limited government.""
It said something could evolve ""and become more dangerous for that small percentage of people that really think our country has been taken away from them.""

""We felt the time had come to stand up and say, 'It's time for the tea party to be responsible members of this democracy and make sure they don't tolerate bigots or bigotry among their members,'"" NAACP President Ben Jealous said ahead of the debate.

""We don't have a problem with the tea party's existence.
We have an issue with their acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists into their organizations,"" he said.

Tea party activist Alex Poulter, who co-founded a Kansas City-area group called Political Chips, also disputed the allegations.
He said the movement is made up of a ""diverse group of folks who are upset with what is going on with this country.""

Poulter said he has seen no evidence of racism within the movement.

""It's unfounded, but people are running with these accusations like they are true,"" he said.

A group called the St. Louis Tea Party issued its own resolution Tuesday calling on the NAACP to withdraw the proposal.

Though not affiliated with either major political party, tea party activists espouse a political philosophy of less government, a free market, lower taxes, individual rights and political activism.

The group has faced occasional claims of racism, most notably in March near the end of the bitter health care debate.
U.S. Reps. John Lewis, Andre Carson and Emanuel Cleaver said some demonstrators, many of them tea party activists, yelled a racial epithet as the black congressmen walked from House office buildings to the Capitol.
Cleaver, D-Mo., also said he was spit on.

A white lawmaker said he also heard the epithets, but conservative activists said the lawmakers were lying.

""They are pulling people together and focusing on the negative, and then it's hard to make anything positive out of that,"" said Anita L. Russell, president of the Kansas City, Mo., branch of the NAACP, which introduced the resolution.
""And then these groups, these extremist groups, are looking for something, and they are latching on to this.""","The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has passed a resolution condemning racism within the Tea Party movement.

basil_58_fox,basil,"NJ Gov Chris Christie to Throw His Hat in the Ring for White House Run

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie expected to become the latest Republican to throw his hat in the ring for 2016.
He’ll make the announcement today at 11am from his hometown of Livingston, New Jersey.

The Governor faces an uphill climb for the nomination with low poll numbers, and a fundraising deficit.
The Washington Post reporter Robert Costa writes of Christie today, “his status as the establishment favorite for the GOP nomination has vanished.
Dogged by scandals and plummeting popularity in his home state, Christie has seen many of the mega-donors who once toasted him drift toward his rivals, including former Florida governor Jeb Bush.”

But don’t write him off.
Maggie Haberman in the New York Times today explains why, “More than any other candidate, Mr. Christie is poised to run a race that sells his personality -- brash, challenging and often combative -- as his main asset.
He has become a maestro of the town hall meeting, standing in a suit taking questions from New Jersey residents around the state until none remain, leaving some people enraged but many more laughing, weeping or hoping he would come over and clasp their hand.”","New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination today.

basil_44_nyt,basil,"Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine who capitalized on his straight-arrow image to win a seat in Congress, was expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges after a lengthy corruption investigation, people with knowledge of the case said on Friday.

The charges against Mr. Grimm, 44, a Republican who was first elected in 2010 and represents Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, were expected to include mail fraud and wire fraud, and to focus largely on his conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned on the Upper East Side of Manhattan after he left the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2006, two of the people said.
He was also expected to be charged with obstruction of justice, for allegedly lying under oath in a federal lawsuit.

The investigation of the second-term congressman, by the F.B.I. and the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn, began more than two years ago with an examination of Mr. Grimm’s fund-raising for his 2010 race and expanded.
Two of his fund-raisers have already been charged.
One, Diana Durand of Houston, was charged with illegally funneling more than $10,000 into his campaign.
The other, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty to visa fraud charges.

But on Friday, it did not appear that the indictment would include any campaign finance charges or accusations that the congressman had misused his office, although several of the people noted that the investigation was continuing.
They all spoke on the condition of anonymity as the charges had not been formally announced and they were not authorized to discuss the case.

A lawyer for Mr. Grimm, William McGinley of Patton Boggs, confirmed in a statement that prosecutors intended to file criminal charges against his client and said that Mr. Grimm “asserts his innocence” and that the investigation was “a politically driven vendetta.”

“After more than two years of investigation plagued by malicious leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy and strong-arm tactics, the U.S. attorney’s office has disclosed its intent to file criminal charges against Congressman Grimm,” Mr. McGinley said.
“When the dust settles, he will be vindicated.
Until then, he will continue to serve his constituents with the same dedication and tenacity that has characterized his lifetime of public service as a member of Congress, Marine Corps combat veteran and decorated F.B.I. special agent.”

Spokesmen for the office of the United States attorney in Brooklyn, Loretta E. Lynch, and for the New York F.B.I. office declined to comment.

Mr. Grimm, the only Republican member of New York City’s congressional delegation, is up for re-election in November and faces a potentially formidable challenger in former City Councilman Domenic M. Recchia Jr., a Democrat who headed the Council’s Finance Committee and was Christine C. Quinn’s chief lieutenant when she was Council speaker.
Healthalicious, the restaurant that the people said was a focus of the indictment, was on Second Avenue near 83rd Street.
The company Mr. Grimm formed to operate it was called Granny Sayz, L.L.C., and was affiliated with a company connected to Mr. Biton, the fund-raiser.

In January 2012, the New York State Workers’ Compensation Board ordered Healthalicious to pay $88,000 for not carrying workers’ compensation insurance.
About a year earlier, two former deliverymen hired a lawyer who contacted Mr. Grimm’s congressional office to complain that the restaurant had paid them less than minimum wage, did not pay for work beyond 40 hours per week and paid them in cash to evade scrutiny.
Shortly afterward, Mr. Grimm filed papers with the state to dissolve Granny Sayz.
The lawyer eventually sued Granny Sayz in federal court.

Mr. Grimm over time developed something of a reputation for being hot-tempered, which did not set him apart from many others in Congress.
But this year, during an encounter with a television reporter, he set a new standard for on-air congressional misbehavior and delivered a bizarre threat.

After President Obama’s State of the Union address, NY1’s Washington reporter, Michael Scotto, interviewed the congressman about the speech.
When he asked about the federal campaign financing investigation, Mr. Grimm stormed off camera but returned and threatened to throw Mr. Scotto off the balcony.
Then, the congressman, speaking in a barely audible whisper as he stood close to the reporter, said Mr. Scotto was “not man enough” and added: “I’ll break you in half. Like a boy.”","Representative Michael G.

basil_64_hpo,basil,"Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hasn’t been shy in recent days about the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, joking that she might move to New Zealand if it ever happens.

“I can’t imagine what this place would be ― I can’t imagine what the country would be ― with Donald Trump as our president,” Ginsburg told The New York Times in an article published Sunday.
“For the country, it could be four years.
For the court, it could be ― I don’t even want to contemplate that.”

That tracks a comment she made in a separate interview with The Associated Press, when the justice stopped short of noting she’d rather have presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton making future appointments to the Supreme Court.

“I don’t want to think about that possibility,” Ginsburg said when asked to consider Trump in the role of appointer-in-chief. 

Now a number of legal academics and Supreme Court observers are raising questions about the propriety of Ginsburg’s candor and what it might mean for the court’s integrity ― with some suggesting she might have to recuse herself from considering any Trump-related case that reaches the high court.

“The other justices should hold an intervention, and tell her to be quiet or step down,” wrote Josh Blackman, a Houston College of Law professor who frequently writes about the high court.
“This isn’t funny anymore.” He added that Ginsburg’s comments are “beyond the pale.”

Rick Hasen, another avid court watcher who specializes in election law, wrote that Ginsburg’s statements could very well lead a “reasonable person” to question her impartiality in a future politically charged case.

“I think this is ultimately a question for judicial ethicists, but I do think following these comments it is a legitimate question to raise, should Donald Trump’s campaign come to the Court with any legal questions before the election,” he wrote in his widely read Election Law Blog.

Dmitry Bam, a professor at the University of Maine School of Law who has written on judicial recusals and ethics, said “there is little question that she has crossed a line.”

“For a court that cares a great deal about appearances, this certainly creates the appearance that justices take sides in elections,” Bam wrote in an email.
“And if Trump v. Clinton arises in the fall, I would say that there is at the very least an appearance of bias if Justice Ginsburg participates.”

Under federal law, justices must step aside from cases where their “impartiality might reasonably be questioned” ― and they did so in 180 cases during the court’s last term, according to a new analysis by Fix the Court, a group that pushes for structural reform at the Supreme Court.

Fix the Court found that the bulk of recent recusals were due to the justices’ prior work as appellate judges or in government positions.
Other recusals were related to stock ownership and family ties to judges or lawyers who participated in earlier stages of the cases.

But recusals for political views or implicit support for certain positions are exceedingly rare, even in the face of a code of judicial conduct that guides federal judges on extra-judicial activities and how to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.

Even with that guidance and other self-imposed checks in place, the justices have time and again declined to step aside in cases of high political salience ― most recently in the same-sex marriage cases, where Ginsburg and Justices Elena Kagan and Clarence Thomas all took part despite calls for them to recuse.

“I’m not aware [that] any justice before has ever commented on the merits or demerits of a presidential candidate,” said Ed Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a frequent contributor to the conservative National Review Online, where he has chronicled this episode and what he deems Ginsburg’s “remarkable record of indiscretions.”

“I may very well share her concerns about Donald Trump ... but the ethics concerns don’t depend on the soundness or unsoundness of the candidate,” Whelan added.

But what if this is less a question about ethics and more about wanting our judges to be candid about their positions and biases ― and that the political process itself has done away with the veneer that the high court is entirely apolitical?

“Most people now recognize that judges are heavily influenced by their personal beliefs and experiences,” said Bam, of the Maine School of Law.

“We have watched one party refuse to hold hearings based the politics of the president and his potential nominees.
Judges time their retirements to coincide with a certain party being in office.
And the 5-4 decision in Bush v. Gore, along partisan lines, also shows the political nature of the court,” Bam said.
“So perhaps the pretense that judges are nonpartisan and apolitical does more harm than good.”","Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has sparked controversy with her recent comments about a potential Donald Trump presidency, joking that she might move to New Zealand if he wins.

basil_52_nyt,basil,"Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, moving to address a growing political firestorm over a religious freedom law enacted last week, said over the weekend that he would seek legislation to clarify the intent of the law, and rejected assertions that it sanctioned discrimination against gays and lesbians.

The governor, a Republican, told The Indianapolis Star on Saturday that he was taken aback by negative reactions to the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which he signed into law on Thursday.
He told the newspaper that he expected legislation clarifying the law to be introduced in the General Assembly this week, but offered no details.

The law aims to protect individuals or companies from being forced to take actions that impose a substantial burden on their religious beliefs.
Proponents say the law should allow Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without fear of legal reprisals.

“I support religious liberty, and I support this law,” the governor said.
“But we are in discussions with legislative leaders this weekend to see if there’s a way to clarify the intent of the law.”

Mr. Pence appeared on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, and the host, George Stephanopoulos, asked him whether signing the law was a mistake.

“Absolutely not,” Mr. Pence said, adding later: “I signed the bill.
We’re going to continue to explain it to people who don’t understand it, and if possible, we will find a way to amplify what this bill really is in the legislative process.”

But his answers to other questions were less clear.
Mr. Pence did not directly answer whether the law might protect, for example, a Christian florist who denied service to a gay couple.
Asserting that the legislation was not about discrimination, he said, “The issue here is, you know, is tolerance a two-way street or not?”

On Saturday, thousands of protesters gathered at the Statehouse as businesses and other governments announced a halt to business with the state and the capital, Indianapolis, over the law.

Marc Benioff, the chief executive officer of Salesforce.com, said on Thursday that his company would halt all corporate travel to Indiana.
On Saturday, Mayor Ed Murray of Seattle announced a ban on city employees traveling to Indiana for work using city funds.

The same day, Bill Oesterle, the chief executive officer of Angie’s List, said his company would abandon a deal with Indiana and Indianapolis to expand its headquarters.
His opposition was seen as an indication of dissatisfaction with the law beyond the liberal political left; he was the campaign director for Mitch Daniels’s successful Republican bid for governor in 2004.

The debate cast a shadow over preparations in Indianapolis for the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament, which will take place in Indianapolis on Saturday and next Monday.
In a statement on Thursday, the N.C.A.A. president, Mark Emmert, said the organization was “deeply concerned” about the legislation.

“We intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our work force,” he said.

The backlash has been an unexpected political headache for Mr. Pence, who is juggling whether to run for re-election or for president in 2016.

Defending the law in the interviews with The Star and Mr. Stephanopoulos, the governor pointed to its origins in federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton and adopted by about 19 other states.
Indiana’s bill was drafted from a version that President Obama voted for when he was a state senator in Illinois, Mr. Pence said.
Critics, however, say the Indiana law includes different wording that could open the door to wider discrimination.

Critics also note that in many of the states with similar laws, including Illinois, sexual orientation is protected under civil rights law.
In Indiana, gays and lesbians are not a protected class.

When asked if he would seek those protections, the governor said that he would not.

basil_4_hpo,basil,"Several prominent conservatives offered swift, negative reactions to Michael Steele on Friday, after the RNC chairman was caught on camera saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama’s choosing. 

The pushback crested with Bill Kristol — still an influential voice among Republican lawmakers — writing a letter to Steele on his Weekly Standard site calling for the RNC leader’s resignation.

“Needless to say, the war in Afghanistan was not “a war of Obama’s choosing.”
It has been prosecuted by the United States under Presidents Bush and Obama.
Republicans have consistently supported the effort.
Indeed, as the DNC Communications Director (of all people) has said, your statement “puts [you] at odds with about 100 percent of the Republican Party.

And not on a trivial matter.
At a time when Gen. Petraeus has just taken over command, when Republicans in Congress are pushing for a clean war funding resolution, when Republicans around the country are doing their best to rally their fellow citizens behind the mission, your comment is more than an embarrassment.
It’s an affront, both to the honor of the Republican party and to the commitment of the soldiers fighting to accomplish the mission they’ve been asked to take on by our elected leaders.

There are, of course, those who think we should pull out of Afghanistan, and they’re certainly entitled to make their case.
But one of them shouldn’t be the chairman of the Republican party.”

Kristol’s was the harshest of all the reactions to the Steele, whose spokesman, it should be noted, tried to clarify the comment by insisting that he merely meant that President Obama has not been forthcoming with a winning strategy. 

But the Weekly Standard editor was not alone.

Another major neoconservative figure, Dan Senor, told the Huffington Post that Steele’s comments are “utterly irresponsible.”
Senor, who served under the Bush administration as chief spokesman in Iraq and has been a major booster of efforts to escalate U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, noted that Steele’s RNC actually sponsored a conference call for his group to praise Obama’s Afghan surge last year. 

Indeed, even Steele himself declared back in December that Afghanistan is “’a war we have to win” — a far cry from the comments he made Thursday night, in which he said: “...you don’t do is engage in a land war in Afghanistan, alright, because everyone who’s tried over a thousand years of history has failed.” 

“It’s completely inconsistent with this latest statement,” summarized Senor. 

In a bit of irony, Steele’s most recent comments have actually resonated among anti-war Democrats who share the skepticism that Afghanistan is a winnable enterprise.
They also, in some respects, echo the opinions of some members of the conservative community (Joe Scarborough and George Will among them) who have been critical of the deployment of U.S. forces in that country. 

But Steele is not an anti-war Democrat. Nor is he a pundit.
He is the figurehead of the Republican Party whose tenure, once again, seems shaky.
Shortly after Kristol called for his resignation, a GOP operative began pitching the column to reporters, hoping that the meme of Steele’s troubles would spread far and wide.","RNC Chairman Michael Steele faced backlash from prominent conservatives after saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama's choosing.

basil_88_hpo,basil,"President Donald Trump said he’s considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who aren’t citizens ― a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment that could likely be changed only through a constitutional amendment.

Trump said in an interview with “Axios on HBO” taped Monday that he could execute the change via executive order.

“It was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment.
Guess what? You don’t,” Trump said.
“You can definitely do it with an act of Congress.
But now they’re saying I can do it just with an executive order.”

He said the right awarded to babies born as birthright Americans is “ridiculous” and that the system “has to end.”

Trump also falsely stated that the U.S. is “the only country in the world” that offers citizenship to those born here.
More than 30 nations, including Canada and Mexico, have similar policies.

It’s not clear what the executive order would look like or when it would be proposed ― if Trump follows through at all, considering his tendency for pre-election bluster and warnings he has received from fellow Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.), who have said doing so would be outside the bounds the president’s authority.

All babies born in the U.S. are American citizens under the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which cannot be changed by presidential order.

Changing that policy would dramatically reshape the U.S. ― effectively punishing the children of undocumented immigrants, whom Trump has vowed to remove from the country.
Even if he doesn’t follow through or succeed, though, Trump’s vow to try aligns with other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants ahead of the midterm elections next Tuesday.

An executive order challenging birthright citizenship would ensure a legal battle, in which most experts think the president would fail.
The Supreme Court ruled in 1898’s U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark that a child born in the U.S. to immigrant parents was a citizen under the 14th Amendment.

“The president cannot erase the Constitution with an executive order, and the 14th Amendment’s citizenship guarantee is clear,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.
“This is a transparent and blatantly unconstitutional attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred in the days ahead of the midterms.”

Some Republicans ― including Ryan ― quickly shot down Trump’s idea.
“You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order,” the House speaker said Tuesday on WVLK Radio, according to Bloomberg News reporter Erik Wasson.

Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) criticized the president’s statement, calling instead for immigration reform “that makes our country more secure and reaffirms our wonderful tradition as a nation of immigrants.”

Another Republican, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, also tweeted that such an executive order would not be possible.

The are some experts who disagree.
Axios cited John Eastman, a constitutional law professor at Chapman University and director of The Claremont Institute’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, who said the amendment has been misapplied and was not intended to apply to every person born in the U.S. regardless of parentage.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced Tuesday that he would introduce legislation “along the same lines as the proposed executive order from President Trump” to end birthright citizenship, a policy change he has supported for years.
It’s unclear what his legislation would look like ― and he has previously suggested such a change would require a constitutional amendment.

“This policy is a magnet for illegal immigration, out of the mainstream of the developed world, and needs to come to an end,” Graham said in a statement on Tuesday.

Trump has long supported ending birthright citizenship, recommending in 2015 on the campaign trail that the country “start a process” to scrap it.

“I don’t think they have American citizenship and if you speak to some very, very good lawyers — and I know some will disagree — but many of them agree with me and you’re going to find they do not have American citizenship.
Our country is going to hell,” Trump said then in an interview with CNN.

The president has lasered in on immigration ahead of next week’s midterm elections, stoking fear about the caravan of migrants heading toward the U.S.-Mexico border from Central America.
He has falsely claimed the caravan is stocked with criminals, gang members and Middle Eastern terrorists, and has threatened to cut off aid to Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, the countries where most of the migrants hail from.

He deployed 5,200 active-duty troops to the border on Monday in what officials of his administration described as a necessary national security measure.","President Donald Trump has announced that he is considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the US to non-citizen parents, a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.

basil_58_nyt,basil,"LIVINGSTON, N.J. — Gov. Chris Christie declared an uphill candidacy for president on Tuesday with New Jersey-style swagger, unconcealed disgust for Washington and a high regard for his own candor, vowing that “there is one thing you will know for sure: I say what I mean and I mean what I say.”

Relying on his biggest, and perhaps his last, remaining advantage in a field of better-financed and better-liked rivals — his personality — Mr. Christie portrayed himself as the only candidate in the Republican field who is forthright and forceful enough to run the country.

“We need strength and decision-making and authority back in the Oval Office,” he said.

Pacing the stage without a prepared text and raising his voice to a shout at times, he vowed to campaign and govern as a colorful teller of difficult truths, even if “it makes you cringe every once in a while.”

“I am not running for president of the United States as surrogate for being elected prom king of America,” Mr. Christie said inside the gymnasium at the high school where he was president of his class all three years.

“I am not going to be the most popular guy who looks into your eye every day and says what you want to hear,” he continued.

Trying to claw his way back to the top of the Republican field, Mr. Christie took a pointed swipe at his rivals who are in the United States Senate, like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who have never run a state government.

“Unlike some people who offer themselves for president in 2016, you won’t have to wonder whether I can do it or not,” he said, invoking the “economic calamity” he said he inherited in 2010 and the “unprecedented natural disaster,” Hurricane Sandy, that he weathered as governor.

But he reserved his deepest disdain for Congress and for the president’s stewardship of foreign affairs, and extended that critique to President Obama’s former secretary of state.

“After seven years of a weak and feckless foreign policy run by Barack Obama, we better not turn it over to his second mate, Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Christie said.

Still, he blamed both parties for dysfunction and gridlock in Washington.
“If Washington and Adams and Jefferson believed that compromise was a dirty word, we’d still be under the crown of England,” he said.

Mr. Christie, whose dazzling rise as a national Republican in his first term was matched only by his spectacular loss of stature at home in his second, entered the presidential race bearing little resemblance to the candidate he once expected to be.

The economic recovery he promised has turned into a cascade of ugly credit downgrades and anemic job growth.
The state pension system he vowed to fix has descended into a morass of missed payments and lawsuits.
The administration he pledged would be a paragon of ethics has instead conspired to mire an entire town in traffic and the governor’s office in scandal.

Three and a half years ago, Mr. Christie seemed such an antidote to all that ailed the Republican brand that senior figures in the party pleaded with him to run for president as a substitute for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney.

But now, a staggering 55 percent of Republican primary voters say that they cannot envision voting for Mr. Christie, according to an NBC-Wall Street Journal Poll.
The only candidate less palatable: Donald J. Trump, the bombastic developer turned reality television star.

With two pillars of his presidential run — his record and his judgment — looking wobbly, Mr. Christie must now build a campaign around his most raw and prodigious asset: his personality, a magnetic mix of quick-witted charm, insult-trading banter, vulnerability, empathy and effrontery.

It was on vivid display Tuesday before hundreds of supporters, including many of Mr. Christie’s oldest friends and most loyal aides.
He joked about the need for a new and refined tax code that would finally put his father, a certified public account standing nearby, out of business.
He described the decision to enter politics as a “coin toss” between him and his wife, Mary Pat, herself a nimble political mind.
And he put an unusual twist on the dilemma facing the financially stretched Social Security system.

“The lying and stealing has already happened, the horse is out of the barn, we need to get it back in, and the only way to do it is by force,” he said.

Mr. Christie, 52, honed his political technique, and developed a YouTube following, during a remarkable run of 137 town-hall-style meetings across New Jersey.
Not surprisingly, he plans to put the town hall meeting at the center of his candidacy — and to put his hopes in a state, New Hampshire, that is famed for its own town hall meetings.
He is forgoing the customary tour of early-voting states that usually follows a formal announcement, aides said.
Instead, Mr. Christie will plant himself in New Hampshire for a week, holding one town hall after another.

Such single-mindedness belies the serious and stubborn vulnerabilities of his campaign.

As a centrist candidate from the Northeast, he would have a difficult path to the Republican presidential nomination under the best circumstances.
And circumstances are anything but optimal for him: He faces a wide field of candidates, including several who are better financed and beloved by mainstream donors (Jeb Bush), hold greater appeal to conservative voters who dominate the primary process (Scott Walker), are agile public speakers with persuasive biographies (Mr. Rubio), or are better liked by Republican voters (all of the above).

At his announcement, Mr. Christie sought political rebirth, as he has before, by relying on his powers as a narrator, and mythologizer, of his own story.

Running for president is a new and bigger stage, though, and both Mr. Christie’s stagecraft and his oratory showed room for improvement.
The first speaker who preceded him to the stage had no microphone, causing a delay; later on, she was booed when she disclosed that she was a Democrat.

Without a text, Mr. Christie frequently descended into clichés.
“The truth will set us free,” he said at one point.
“One person can make a difference,” he said at another.

But he also spoke with emotional power, as when he recalled his father’s early job in an ice cream factory in Newark.

“Think about how amazing this country is,” Mr. Christie said.
“That one generation removed from that guy who was working on the floor of the Breyers ice cream plant, his son is the two-term governor of the state that he was born and raised in.”

The question for Mr. Christie, after a bruising year of watching his story rewritten by others, may be whether Republican voters, who can choose from among a long and intriguing list of fresher faces, will give him a fighting chance to sell himself anew.","New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his presidential candidacy, touting his straight-talking style and leadership experience.

basil_8_hpo,basil,"Senior White House officials significantly raised the stakes on congressional Democrats in their efforts to get a deal passed on the Bush tax cuts, warning on Wednesday that inaction would ""significantly increase the risk"" of a double dip recession.

It wasn't quite the metaphorical flare of mushroom cloud imagery, but outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers offered a fairly dire assessment of the stakes in the tax cut debate.

""If they [Democrats] don't pass this bill in the next couple weeks it will materially increase the risk that the economy would stall out and we would have a double dip,"" he told a gathering of reporters at an off camera briefing.

A double dip recession?

""What I said it would significantly increase the risk,"" Summers replied.

The message was hardly subtle. But it certainly was debatable.
Summers himself, downplayed the significance of continuing the Bush tax cuts back in September -- though he was speaking, then, about the rates for the rich and the tax cut deal, at that point in time, did not include money for a 13-month extension of unemployment insurance or other tax incentives to help lower income workers.

Asked whether the country would find itself dipping towards the economic doldrums if Congress waited a month or two to get a tax cut package passed, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official in the Clinton White House and a proponent of the current tax cut deal, offered more sober-minded analysis.

""The wait would not cause a double dip,"" he said.
""A double dip would come out of the reality of a relatively contractionary fiscal policy...
I do think the deal that they announced is stimulative.
And it ought to boost growth by some increment...
But the issue is, that the deal certainly is not enough to lift the economy to a different place.
Will we see what happened with the large stimulus happen here, which is once the stimulus is over the economy returns to slow growth? That's the danger.
And I keep on saying this, the single most important thing they can do to avert that is to stabilize housing prices.""

Stabilizing the housing market, however, is not on the current congressional docket.
And on Wednesday, the White House began a robust process of selling the deal to Democrats -- skeptical, as they are, about an extension of Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and a generous revision of the estate tax.

There were few carrots to go along with the sticks.
Asked, for instance, if the White House would be willing to revise the informal compromise to bring more Democratic lawmakers on board, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said any changes would be fine, so long as they didn't result in decreased support.
Then he cautioned: ""The physics and the blood and the sweat that might be involved in that, I'm not entirely sure I would put it quite as simply as that.""

If anything, the pitch being offered from the administration to the rest of the party was: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn.

""I guess the question back for those who ask [why not fight for more] is where does this go, what is the end game and what are the consequences of playing it?"" said senior adviser David Axelrod.
""Do they have a sense of how this ends and how long will that take, because as Larry said there are real consequences to that.
Just as the forecasts went up on the basis of this agreement they will go down if this agreement fails. That we know.
We know that on January 1 people's taxes will go up, we know that at the end of this month 2 million people will lose their unemployment insurance.
And so there are real consequences to that decision.
We, I think we all stipulate, the president did, no one likes those provisions that they dislike but on the other side of the ledger are significant things that will help people and help the economy.

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Tuesday renewed his attack on his “deep state” Justice Department, and said a top aide to 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton should be jailed.

Trump, returning to Washington after spending the holidays at his Florida resort, posted an early-morning tweet lashing out at former Clinton aide Huma Abedin, apparently in response to Abedin emails released by the State Department on Friday.

The emails, disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the conservative group Judicial Watch, were uncovered during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to Politico, part of the FBI’s probe into Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state.
Abedin reportedly forwarded State Department emails, including some that contained passwords, to a personal account.
Trump and his right-wing allies continue to raise the issue.

Trump also said in his tweet that the Justice Department must act on “Comey and others,” a reference to former FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election until Trump fired him in May.

Trump, in tweets and interviews, has repeatedly sought to undermine his Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified.
He has criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions numerous times for recusing himself from supervising the Russia investigation, and claims to have the right to direct government investigations himself.

Last week, Trump asserted in a New York Times interview that he had the “absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department.”","President Donald Trump has renewed his attack on the Justice Department, calling it the ""deep state"" and demanding that a top aide to Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin, be jailed.

basil_5_fox,basil,"The NAACP adopted a resolution Tuesday condemning ""racist elements"" in the Tea Party movement and calling on the movement's leaders to repudiate bigotry, despite claims from Tea Partiers that the measure is just a political ploy.

The nation's leading civil rights group took up the language at its annual convention in Kansas City, Mo.
The resolution initially said the NAACP would ""repudiate the racism of the Tea Parties"" and stand against the movement's attempt to ""push our country back to the pre-civil rights era,"" though the wording was amended to downplay criticism of all Tea Partiers while asking them to repudiate bigots in their own ranks.

""We take no issue with the Tea Party movement.
We believe in freedom of assembly and people raising their voices in a democracy,"" the NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said in a written statement announcing the unanimous vote.
""What we take issue with is the Tea Party's continued tolerance for bigotry and bigoted statements.

""The time has come for them to accept the responsibility that comes with influence and make clear there is no place for racism and anti-Semitism, homophobia and other forms of bigotry in their movement.""

NAACP leaders have referenced an incident in March when Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers on Capitol Hill ahead of a health care vote.

But Tea Party members have challenged claims that their activists accosted black lawmakers in March and no visual evidence has been produced depicting a racist attack.
Dallas Tea Party founder Phillip Dennis said ""there was no proof"" of racist behavior at the event and that the movement welcomes minority members.

""We don't care about the pigment of one's skin,"" he said.
Dennis accused the NAACP of playing the ""race card"" and called the organization ""irrelevant.""

The nearby St. Louis Tea Party had an all-hands-on-deck response to the NAACP's plan.
The group has drafted a resolution of its own condemning the civil rights group for reducing itself to a ""bigoted"" and ""partisan attack dog organization.""

Debate was mostly closed to the public, but the final version ""calls on the tea party and all people of good will to repudiate the racist element and activities within the tea party,"" said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau.

The final wording won't be released until the NAACP's national board of directors approves the resolution during its meeting in October.
But the original called for the NAACP to ""educate its membership and the community that this movement is not just about higher taxes and limited government.""
It said something could evolve ""and become more dangerous for that small percentage of people that really think our country has been taken away from them.""

In a matter of hours, the St. Louis group fired off to the NAACP the statement demanding the organization withdraw its ""bigoted, false and inflammatory"" resolution.
The missive accused the NAACP of resorting to political tactics and urged the IRS to reconsider whether it can continue to qualify for tax-exempt status.

Tea Party organizers routinely defend themselves against charges of racism, disavowing racially charged signs that appear in their protest crowds and provide fodder for Tea Party critics.
The NAACP resolution, first reported by the Kansas City Star, was expected to make reference to the March incident on Capitol Hill.

St. Louis Tea Party organizer Bill Hennessy wrote on the group's website Tuesday that the Tea Party stands for smaller government and fiscal responsibility, and accused the NAACP of abandoning black America.

""When you look at the crime and poverty and family breakdown of the African-American community ... you see a half-century of failure by the NAACP,"" he wrote.
""None of those persistent problems was caused by the Tea Party movement, yet the principles of the Tea Party are exactly what's needed to wind down the multigenerational destruction in the African-American community.

""The NAACP was once a vital weapon in the war against segregation and oppression.
All that's left is a bigoted and malicious shell that does far more harm than good for people who need a break,"" he wrote.

Fellow St. Louis Tea Party organizer Dana Loesch accused the NAACP of morphing into a political organization.

“They no longer prioritize civil rights,” she told Fox News.","The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning ""racist elements"" in the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry.

basil_72_fox,basil,"President Trump said Thursday he is “very close” to naming a new FBI director to replace James Comey, and his leading contender is former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman.

Lieberman, 75, who served in the Senate from 1989-2013, first as a Democrat and then as an independent, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday afternoon to discuss leading the law enforcement agency.
A late and somewhat unlikely addition to Trump's short list, Lieberman is nonetheless the sudden frontrunner.

When asked point-blank by a reporter in the Oval Office Thursday if Lieberman was the leading contender, Trump replied, ""Yes.""

Trump also met Wednesday with current acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and FBI official Richard McFeely.

Lieberman’s law enforcement experience stems from his two-term tenure as Connecticut’s attorney general, spanning from 1983 until his resignation in 1989 when he was elected to the U.S. Senate.

Lieberman, who ran as vice president on Al Gore's 2000 ticket, became an independent after losing the Democratic primary in 2006.
He won re-election, and two years later further angered Democrats when he endorsed John McCain for president against eventual winner Barack Obama, even speaking at the Republican National Convention.

Lieberman told Fox Business Network last year that he “never changed parties” and in fact ended up endorsing Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign against Trump.

Some Republican senators called the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey “intriguing,” but Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said it was a “mistake” to nominate him.

""Lieberman is probably the only person who can get 100 votes in the Senate,"" Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said on Capitol Hill on Thursday after the closed Senate briefing with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
Cornyn was on the White House's shortlist to replace Comey, but withdrew himself from consideration this week.

On Thursday morning on the Senate floor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., argued against a “career politician” of either party to lead the FBI, though he did not name Lieberman.","President Trump announced that he is close to naming a new FBI director to replace James Comey, with former Democratic Sen.

basil_54_hpo,basil,"Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) signed a revised version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act on Thursday, one day after refusing to sign an earlier version of the bill over concerns about discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals.

Earlier Thursday, the Republican-controlled state legislature passed a new version of the bill at the governor's request, amending provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers.
The amended legislation mirrors the federal RFRA.

Meanwhile, legislators in Indiana have made changes to the controversial RFRA signed into law by Gov. Mike Pence (R) last week.
On Thursday, the state's general assembly passed new language explicitly stating that the law does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
The changes came amid immense national backlash, with dozens of politicians, business leaders and celebrities speaking out against the bill.

In a Wednesday press conference announcing his opposition to the initial version of the bill, Hutchinson said his son had asked him to veto the legislation.

""And he gave me permission to make that reference, and it shows that families -- and there's a generational difference of opinion on these issues.""

basil_15_fox,basil,"Rep. Michele Bachmann has declined to get into the scrum with Newsweek over its cover story of the presidential candidate called ""The Queen of Rage,"" accompanied by an unflattering photo of the Minnesota Republican, but others are calling the magazine out of bounds in its depiction.

The National Organization for Women President Terry O'Neill said that the cover of the magazine's latest edition is ""sexist"" and referred to a simple test by the group's founder Gloria Steinem to explain how they determined that conclusion -- would the magazine do the same to a man.

""Who has ever called a man 'The King of Rage?'
Basically what Newsweek magazine -- and this is important, what Newsweek magazine, not a blog, Newsweek magazine -- what they are saying of a woman who is a serious contender for president of the United States of America…
They are basically casting her as a nut job,"" O'Neill said to The Daily Caller and NOW confirmed to FoxNews.com on Tuesday.

""The 'Queen of Rage' is something you apply to wrestlers or somebody who is crazy.
They didn’t even do this to Howard Dean when he had his famous scream,"" she said.

Newsweek has defended the photo -- an extreme close-up of the crystal blue-eyed Bachmann looking over the camera with a dark blue background -- saying that several of the images taken of her appeared the same way.
The magazine posted other photos of her on its website, and many of them are flattering.

Bachmann was asked about the cover during an appearance in Iowa on Monday, where she is campaigning ahead of Thursday's Fox News/Washington Examiner debate and Saturday's Ames Straw Poll.
She told voters she had not seen the cover.

""Ah-hah,"" she said when told the story headline.
""Well, we'll have to take a look at that, won't we?""

O'Neill said that the main reason her group, which disagrees with Bachmann on almost every issue, would stand up for and defend Bachmann against ""these kind of misogynistic attacks is we want women to run for office.""

""Of course my job is to defeat Michele Bachmann and I intend to do so.
But good women will not run for office if Newsweek magazine can do this to such a prominent politician and get away with it,"" O'Neill said.

Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center and ForAmerica, said he's not surprised by the magazine cover.

""Both Time and Newsweek have been doing this to conservatives for years.
It is sheer journalistic dishonesty,"" Bozell told FoxNews.com.

basil_99_nyt,basil,"WASHINGTON — The House Intelligence Committee’s first hearing since Robert S. Mueller III completed his report had barely begun when the panel’s Republicans moved en masse to demand the resignation of the committee’s chairman.

It went downhill from there.

The acrimony on display Thursday as the intelligence committee tried to resume its work on Russia’s intervention in the 2016 presidential election laid bare the bitter divide that persists in Congress even after Mr. Mueller, the special counsel, completed his 22-month investigation of the subject.
The Republican demand and the barbed response of the committee’s chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff, echoed well outside the wood-paneled House hearing room.

Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, spent much of his weekly news conference comparing Mr. Schiff, a fellow Californian, to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, who fueled fears in the 1950s that Communist spies had infiltrated the American government.
Representative Michael R. Turner, Republican of Ohio, played the same card in the hearing room, fuming that Mr. Schiff would not accept Attorney General William P. Barr’s word that Mr. Mueller had not found the Trump campaign to have taken part in a conspiracy to undermine the election.

“With McCarthyism,” a senator was “chasing after Russian Communists,” Mr. Turner, an Intelligence Committee member, said.
“Now we have Schiff chasing after Russian collusion.”

Undaunted, Mr. Schiff made clear he was not about to step down, nor was he about to absolve President Trump or his campaign from nefarious conduct with Moscow — especially without seeing Mr. Mueller’s report first.
The Justice Department revealed on Thursday that the report came in at more than 300 pages, raising more questions about what information was behind the four-page summary released by Mr. Barr.

Mr. Schiff had many questions of his own.

“You might think that it’s O.K. that the president’s son-in-law sought to establish a secret back channel of communications with the Russians through a Russian diplomatic facility.
I don’t think that’s O.K. You might think it’s O.K. that an associate of the president made direct contact with the G.R.U. through Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks; that is considered a hostile intelligence agency,” Mr. Schiff said, referring to Russian military intelligence and a Russian intelligence hacker.

He continued: “You might think that it’s O.K. that the national security-designate secretly conferred with the Russian ambassador about undermining U.S. sanctions.
And you might think it’s O.K. he lied about it to the F.B.I. You might say that’s all O.K.
You might say that’s just what you need to do to win.
But I don’t think it’s O.K. I think it’s immoral. I think it’s unethical. I think it’s unpatriotic. And yes, I think it’s corrupt.”

Democrats who now control the House say that they will accept Mr. Mueller’s findings, but as Mr. Schiff’s monologue indicated they are increasingly determined not to let go of what they see as a deeply troubling pattern of wrongdoing by Mr. Trump, his businesses and his administration.

That has in turn enraged Republicans, who have happily embraced what they call Mr. Mueller’s absolution of Mr. Trump.
They say Democrats will stop at nothing to ruin his presidency, and bristle at Democrats accusing them of turning a blind eye to the Russian threat.
And at the center of their wrath is Mr. Schiff, whose doughy-faced demeanor hardly evokes an attack dog.

“The findings of the special counsel conclusively refute your past and present assertions and have exposed you as having abused your position to knowingly promote false information, having damaged the integrity of this committee, and undermined faith in U.S. government institutions,” Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, said to Mr. Schiff.

Reading from a letter signed by every Republican member of the committee, Mr. Conaway added, “Your actions both past and present are incompatible with your duties as chairman of this committee.”

Mr. Trump intervened as well, accusing Mr. Schiff of “knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking.”
He “should be forced to resign from Congress!” the president wrote on Twitter.

Mr. Schiff, clearly prepared for the ambush, argued that there was a difference between prosecutors proving a criminal conspiracy and the committee investigating evidence of foreign compromise.
The committee’s own investigative work would go on, he signaled, though outside the hearing room he has indicated that work may well need to shift course once Mr. Mueller’s findings are fully understood.

Democrats backed him.
“History will clarify what has happened,” said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California praised Mr. Schiff as “calm, professional, patriotic,” and said his work as the chairman of the committee has been “in stark contrast to the irresponsible and almost criminal behavior of the previous chair of the committee,” Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California.

“What is the president afraid of — that he would go after a chairman of the committee?” she said.
“I think they’re just scaredy-cats.
They just don’t know what to do.”

The party gave Mr. Schiff a more formal nod of confidence this week as well.
On Wednesday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats’ campaign arm, announced that Mr. Schiff would serve as a key fund-raiser for the caucus’s most vulnerable members to help put together a firewall to project the House majority.

Out of the glare of the television cameras, Democrats are somewhat more circumspect.

“In the heat of the political moment just as the Republicans wanted to try to convict Hillary Clinton in the public sphere, Democrats probably contributed to the expectations that the outcome would be worse for the president than it was,” Mr. Himes said in an interview a day ahead of the hearing.

Notably sitting out the fight was Mr. Nunes, whom Democrats have accused of many of the same abuses that Republicans accused Mr. Schiff of on Thursday and whose resignation they asked for last year.
Mr. Nunes’s sustained work last term to scrutinize the origins of the Russia investigation and accuse federal law enforcement officials of acting out of anti-Trump political bias sent convulsions through what in quieter times is one of Congress’s more bipartisan bodies.

“We should not be used as a platform to spread false information and bizarre conspiracies,” Mr. Nunes said on Thursday in brief remarks before deferring to Mr. Conaway.

Thursday’s showdown came, ironically enough, during a hearing with four subject experts on “Putin’s Playbook: The Kremlin’s Use of Oligarchs, Money and Intelligence in 2016 and Beyond.”
Down the line, the witnesses warned that Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia would only grow bolder in its efforts to destabilize western democracies, including the United States.

“The bad news is that there is a new ideological fight between Putinism and the West, and it has only just begun,” said Michael McFaul, an ambassador to Moscow under former President Barack Obama.
“In my estimation, we as a country are underestimating it.”

The whole episode offered a sharp contrast to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which with a yawning pace and no-leaks team has continued apace with its own Russia investigation.
The committee’s chairman, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, said this week that he aimed to finish witness interviews in the coming weeks and issue the last in a series of reports on the panel’s findings in the coming months.

On Thursday, as Democrats and Republicans in the House traded recriminations, the Senate panel quietly called back for another interview with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser.","The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since the release of the Mueller report was marked by acrimony and bitter division.

basil_35_nyt,basil,"WASHINGTON — E-mails released by the White House on Wednesday revealed a fierce internal jostling over the government’s official talking points in the aftermath of last September’s attack in Benghazi, Libya, not only between the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency, but at the highest levels of the C.I.A.

The 100 pages of e-mails showed a disagreement between David H. Petraeus, then the director of the C.I.A., and his deputy, Michael J. Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points, which were used by Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations, in television appearances days after the attack.

Mr. Morell, administration officials said, deleted a reference in the draft version of the talking points to C.I.A. warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to because they feared it would reflect badly on them.

Mr. Morell, officials said, acted on his own and not in response to pressure from the State Department.
But when the final draft of the talking points was sent to Mr. Petraeus, he dismissed them, saying “Frankly, I’d just as soon not use this,” adding that the heavily scrubbed account would not satisfy the House Democrat who had requested it.

“This is certainly not what Vice Chairman Ruppersberger was hoping to get,” Mr. Petraeus wrote, referring to Representative C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which had asked Mr. Petraeus for talking points to use with reporters in discussing the attack on Benghazi.

The White House released the e-mails to reporters after Republicans seized on snippets of the correspondence that became public on Friday to suggest that President Obama’s national security staff had been complicit in trying to alter the talking points for political reasons.

While the e-mails portrayed White House officials as being sensitive to the concerns of the State Department, they suggest that Mr. Obama’s aides mostly mediated a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the C.I.A. over how much to disclose — all under heavy time constraints because of the demands from Capitol Hill.
The e-mails revealed no new details about the administration’s evolving account of the Sept. 11 attack, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.

“In recent days, these e-mails have been selectively and inaccurately read out to the media,” said a White House spokesman, Eric Schultz.
By releasing them, he said, the White House had shown that the drafting process was “focused on providing the facts as we knew them, based on the best information available at the time and protecting an ongoing investigation.”

Still, the final version of the talking points is stripped of material — including a reference to Libya being awash with weapons and fighters that made it a dangerous environment — which critics say would have raised questions about the State Department’s security posture.

Republicans welcomed the release of the e-mails, saying they confirmed that the administration had airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign.
They also said the e-mails belied the White House’s insistence that it had changed only one word in the talking points.

“The seemingly political nature of the State Department’s concerns raises questions about the motivations behind these changes and who at the State Department was seeking them,” said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner.

In releasing the e-mails, the White House was hoping to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate over the talking points.
It drew attention to a draft of the talking points — the only document provided by the White House that was not part of an e-mail chain — in which Mr. Morell, in his own writing, crossed out five lines that referred to C.I.A. warnings about the threat of attacks by Al Qaeda-linked extremists in Benghazi and eastern Libya.

But there is no other evidence in the e-mails that Mr. Morell himself objected to the inclusion of this material.
In an e-mail to Mr. Petraeus accompanying the final version of the talking points, Mr. Morell referred to the State Department’s deep concerns about the references.

The release of the e-mails offers a rare glimpse inside the White House five days after the attack as it struggled to piece together intelligence to formulate a public account of what happened.

The process began in earnest at 4:20 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 14, when Stephen W. Preston, the C.I.A. general counsel, sent an e-mail to other agency officials warning them not to disclose information that might interfere with the F.B.I.’s investigation.

At 6:20 p.m., the spokesman for the National Security Council at the time, Tommy Vietor, e-mailed to remind officials that Denis McDonough, then the deputy national security adviser and now the White House chief of staff, wanted to ensure that the edits were coordinated with the State Department.

At 6:41 p.m., Shawn Turner, the spokesman for the director of national intelligence, suggested saying that on Sept. 10, the C.I.A. had “notified” the American embassy in Cairo, not “warned” it, of social media reports calling for a demonstration and encouraging jihadists to break into the embassy.
Mr. Morell later removed the entire reference.

At 7:16 p.m., Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, weighed in with her initial concerns about ensuring that the talking points provided to lawmakers did not go further than what the administration was telling reporters.

Twenty-three minutes later, Ms. Nuland sent White House and intelligence officials an even more pointed e-mail, objecting that the talking points could be “abused” by lawmakers “to beat the State Department for not paying attention to agency warnings so why do we want to feed that either? Concerned ... ”

At 7:51 p.m., the F.B.I. offered only minor changes to the draft, the bureau’s only suggestions during the contentious process.

At 9:24 p.m., Ms. Nuland, reading the latest draft, complained in an e-mail, “These don’t resolve all my issues or those of my building leadership.”
Ten minutes later, Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, offered his first comments, saying, “We need to resolve this in a way that respects all of the relevant equities, especially the investigation.”

In a report that set off the latest tempest over the talking points, ABC News reported incorrectly that Mr. Rhodes had emphasized the need to protect the State Department’s interests.

At 9:52 p.m., a C.I.A. spokesman e-mailed to other agency staff members a draft note intended for Mr. Petraeus, warning him that while the White House had quickly cleared the proposed talking points, the State Department had “major concerns.”

Mr. Obama’s national security deputies reviewed the talking points at a meeting the next day, Sept. 15, Mr. Rhodes said.

At 11:25 a.m., Mr. Rhodes changed a reference to the United States “consulate” in Benghazi to “diplomatic post.”

Over the next couple of hours, aides made small final changes and e-mailed a final version to lawmakers shortly after 3 p.m.

With time short before Ms. Rice began taping her appearances on Sunday morning news programs, the White House also supplied her aides with the final talking points.

Asked by one of Ms. Rice’s aides, “Is this the final language you want to use on Benghazi,” Mr. Rhodes replied with a single word: “Yup.”","The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing internal disagreements over the government's official talking points after the Benghazi attack in September 2012.

basil_60_nyt,basil,"At almost all of his campaign rallies, Donald J. Trump leads a familiar refrain as he details his plan to build a giant wall along the border with Mexico.

“Who’s gonna pay?” he asks.

Without fail, Mr. Trump’s adoring fans reply, “Mexico!”

While the Mexican government has said little about Mr. Trump’s plan to beef up border security, two of the country’s former presidents have a message for Mr. Trump: Mexico won’t pay.

“I’m not going to pay,” Vicente Fox said, using a profanity to comment about the wall Thursday in an interview with Fusion.
“He should pay for it. He’s got the money.”

Mr. Fox, who was president of Mexico from 2000 to 2006, was clear in his opposition to Mr. Trump, calling him “egocentric” and lacking in any political values.
Mr. Fox also expressed disbelief that Mr. Trump did well with Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday and called on them to open their eyes.

“I’d like to know who those Hispanics are,” Mr. Fox said.
“They are followers of a false prophet.”

Mr. Fox’s successor, Felipe Calderón, expressed similar concerns about the wall this month.

“Mexican people, we are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall!” Mr. Calderón told CNBC.
“And it’s going to be completely useless.”

Mr. Calderón, who was president from 2006 until 2012, went on to argue that Mr. Trump was misinformed about the flow of immigrants from Mexico to the United States and that closing the border would harm America’s economy.

For his part, Mr. Trump has insisted that as president he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, which he estimates would cost about $8 billion.

On Thursday, however, he appeared to be more angered by Mr. Fox’s tone.
Mr. Trump, who has been criticized for lacing his campaign speeches with profanity, called on Mr. Fox to apologize for using foul language when talking about the wall.","Two former presidents of Mexico, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have rejected Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, stating that Mexico will not pay for it.

basil_43_fox,basil,"Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is under fire after a video surfaced Tuesday of him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as a “farmer from Iowa who never went to law school” — in the middle of Braley’s campaign for Senate in the state known for its agriculture industry.

Braley apologized for the remarks in a written statement after the video was released.
He said he “respects” Grassley and proclaimed his support for Iowa’s farmers.

“I have tremendous respect for Iowa farmers and appreciate how important they are to our state, and I’m grateful to have the support of hundreds of farmers across Iowa,” he said.

The video, which was posted online by the conservative super PAC America Rising, apparently shows Braley speaking to a group of lawyers at a fundraiser in Texas.

Braley says if elected to the Senate to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, he would want to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
He said Grassley, though, would likely become chairman of that committee if Republicans take the Senate.

“To put this in stark contrast, if you help me win this race you may have someone with your background, your experience, your voice, someone who’s been literally fighting tort reform for thirty years, in a visible or public way, on the Senate Judiciary Committee,” he said.
“Or, you might have a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, never practiced law, serving as the next chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.”

A spokesperson for Grassley fired back Tuesday, telling FoxNews.com that by Braley’s logic he, as a trial lawyer, would not be eligible to speak out on a number of policy issues like agriculture, energy or health care.
The spokesperson also touted Grassley’s “strong record” on the judiciary committee.

“Alongside that, Sen. Grassley’s one of only two working family farmers in the United States Senate, where he brings Iowa common sense to work for ag, anti-trust, transportation, environmental, energy, trade, health care, communications, national security, and tax policy that works for all of America,” the aide said.","Iowa Democratic Rep.

basil_72_nyt,basil,"President Trump, 24 hours from his self-imposed deadline for picking a new F.B.I. director, told reporters on Thursday that he was “very close” to choosing a successor to James B. Comey, and he named Joseph I. Lieberman, the former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, as a finalist.

But members of Mr. Trump’s staff — alarmed by his rapid embrace of Mr. Lieberman, a charming 75-year-old political operator with no federal law enforcement experience — have quietly urged him to take more time to make such a critical hire.
By late Thursday, the president appeared increasingly likely to leave Friday for a nine-day foreign trip without picking a new director, according to three senior administration officials speaking on the condition of anonymity.

Mr. Lieberman, who served three terms in the Senate as a Democrat and one as an independent, would be an atypical choice to lead the F.B.I., whose agents prize the bureau’s independence as one of Washington’s few apolitical institutions.
Judges and former prosecutors, not elected officials, have frequently been chosen.

Administration officials described the search as fluid and said the president and his team were keeping the decision-making process closely held to avoid the leaks that Mr. Trump believes are endemic to the West Wing.

Still, Mr. Trump, speaking briefly with reporters in the Oval Office as he met with President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, offered an emphatic “yes” when asked whether Mr. Lieberman was among the finalists.

“We need a great director of the F.B.I. I cherish the F.B.I.
It’s special,” he told reporters later at a joint East Room news conference with Mr. Santos.
“All over the world, no matter where you go, the F.B.I. is special.
The F.B.I. has not had that special reputation with what happened in the campaign, what happened with respect to the Clinton campaign, and even, you could say — directly or indirectly — with respect to the much more successful Trump campaign.”

It was unclear whether the president’s acknowledgment that Mr. Lieberman was a finalist was intended to stoke the “Apprentice”-style frenzy of speculation he has favored with other high-profile picks, only to opt for a lesser-known candidate.

Mr. Trump is still seeking applicants, and some aides, along with many law enforcement officials, have suggested that he hire from within the agency to repair some of the damage to morale wrought by Mr. Comey’s sudden firing.
Adam S. Lee, the well-regarded special agent in charge of the bureau’s Richmond, Va., field office, was interviewed, as were Richard A. McFeely, a former senior official at the F.B.I., and Andrew G. McCabe, the acting director.

Mr. McCabe, a veteran agent who joined the bureau in 1996 and once specialized in Russian organized crime, was named deputy director in 2016.
It is not clear whether he will return to that role once Mr. Comey’s replacement is confirmed.

All three men are under consideration, the administration officials said, even if Mr. Lieberman, who was Al Gore’s running mate in the 2000 presidential campaign, is the front-runner.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Lieberman had good chemistry when they met privately, one White House aide said — a key ingredient for Mr. Trump in hiring people.
He is also friendly with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator, who has told Trump aides that Mr. Lieberman would most likely receive overwhelming support in the Senate.

Democrats pushed back hard on that notion, casting the conservative Mr. Lieberman as a Democrat in name only and noting that he publicly supported Mr. Trump’s pick of Michael T. Flynn as his first national security adviser.
At a closed-door Democratic lunch on Thursday, Senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois urged party members to hold the line if he is selected.

But casting Mr. Lieberman as the most likely choice did have one immediate advantage: It appealed to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who had suggested this week that the firestorm over Mr. Trump’s ouster of Mr. Comey was as bad as Watergate.
Mr. McCain defended Mr. Lieberman, who endorsed his 2008 run for president.

The White House remains divided, and several senior officials expressed serious doubts about Mr. Lieberman.
His age, 75, could be problematic, they said, given that F.B.I. directors serve 10-year terms.
And he is employed by one of the firms where Marc E. Kasowitz, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, works, raising the prospect of conflict-of-interest accusations.

If Mr. Trump picks Mr. Lieberman, one adviser said he might serve for a short stint — to lend his bipartisan reputation to a president badly in needed of credibility — instead of the full term.
Mr. Lieberman also has law enforcement experience as the former attorney general of Connecticut.

Others on Mr. Trump’s list are former Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma and former Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, both Republicans.
Mr. Rogers, a former F.B.I. agent, was endorsed by the agents’ association.

Also interviewed were two other judges, Michael J. Garcia of the New York State Court of Appeals and Henry E. Hudson of Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.","President Trump is close to selecting a new FBI director, with former Democratic senator Joseph I. Lieberman as a finalist.

basil_18_fox,basil,"Down in the polls, Texas Gov. Rick Perry is on the attack, claiming in a new TV ad that President Obama is waging a ""War on Religion,"" and he's the GOP candidate that can defend faith in America.

""I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a Christian, but you don't need to be in the pew every Sunday to know there's something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school.

And I'll fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage,"" says Perry in the new ad titled ""Strong.""

The ad is a state-wide buy in Iowa that starts Wednesday.

Perry ties his faith to his conservative stands on social issues, and the campaign has zeroed in on gay marriage and social issues recently, releasing several statements laying out its argument that Obama is attacking the fundamentals social conservative believe in.
The arguments range from President Obama directing the Justice Department to stop arguing for the Defense of Marriage Act, to less substantive examples like Obama leaving God out of his Thanksgiving speech this year.

In one emailed statement, Perry stated, ""just when you thought Barack Obama couldn't get any more out of touch with America's values, AP reports his administration wants to make foreign aid decisions based on gay rights.
This administration's war on traditional American values must stop.
This is just the most recent example of an administration at war with people of faith in this country.

basil_61_fox,basil,"Sen. Ted Cruz has laid down the gauntlet in the growing war of words with Donald Trump over the Republican presidential candidates’ wives.

The Texas lawmaker blamed his rival for the National Enquirer story published Friday that alleged Cruz has had extramarital affairs, and after hits from Trump’s campaign about the mental health of his wife, the firebrand senator appears to be backing away from his pledge to support Trump if the billionaire real estate mogul wins the GOP nomination.

“I don’t make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family,” Cruz said at a press conference after a Wisconsin rally, according to The Hill.

He added, “Donald Trump is not going to be the Republican nominee.”

Earlier in the campaign, GOP candidates signed a promise not to run as an independent if they were not nominated.
The move was meant to convince voters that Trump would remain faithful to the Republican Party even if he lost.

“It is garbage, complete and utter lies,” Cruz said about the National Enquirer article alleging that he has had multiple affairs.
“It is a tabloid smear, and it has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen.”

Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson responded to claims that she is one of the mystery women referred to in the article, stating on Twitter that the allegation is “stupidity on all levels.”

“Of course the National Enquirer story is 100 percent false!,” Pierson tweeted.

Of course the National Enquirer story is 100% FALSE!!!
I only speak to myself, however.

Earlier this year, the tabloid endorsed Trump for president with an issue that included an article giving ten reasons why the reality TV star is the “only choice for the White House.”

The intensely personal feud between Cruz and Trump began earlier this week when a super PAC that opposes Trump posted a meme-style ad featuring a naked Melania Trump that Trump’s then-girlfriend, a professional model, posed for more that 15 years ago for British GQ.

Make America Awesome PAC paid for the ads and posted them on Facebook and Instagram.

The photo features Mrs. Trump sprawled out naked on a fur rug inside a Boeing 727.
The social media posts read, “Meet Melania Trump. Your next First Lady. Or you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.”

An angry Trump lashed out at Cruz on Twitter, calling the senator a liar, as he has alleged before in the campaign, and threatening to “spill the beans” about Cruz's wife Heidi.

“Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a GQ shoot in his ad,” Trump said on the social media site.
“Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!”

Cruz quickly retorted by saying that the ads did not come not from his campaign, and called Trump a “coward” threatening to go after his wife.

“Pic of your wife not from us,” Cruz said.
“Donald, if you try to attack Heidi, you're more of a coward than I thought. #classless.”

The lurch into the sort of personal territory that's normally off limits in campaigns occurred as an anti-Trump super PAC began running an ad in primary states featuring women reciting comments made by the billionaire that are derogatory toward women.
That ad was produced by Our Principles, a group founded by a former Mitt Romney campaign adviser who is trying to help the GOP appeal to women.

allsides_white_house_l_3,allsides,"(CNN) President Barack Obama , in his first visit to a mosque in the United States, said Wednesday he was seeking to rebut ""inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans"" from Republican presidential candidates.

Attempting to recast what he said was a warped image of Islam while encouraging members of the faith to speak out against terror, Obama described Muslims as essential to the fabric of America.

""Let me say as clearly as I can as president of the United States: you fit right here,"" Obama told the audience at the Islamic Society of Baltimore, a 47-year-old mosque with thousands of attendees.
""You're right where you belong.
You're part of America too.
You're not Muslim or American.
You're Muslim and American.""

As he decried GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, Obama insisted that applying religious screens would only amplify messages coming from terrorist groups.
In his final year in office, Obama has sought to use his public platform -- however waning -- to advocate against what he sees as dangerous threads in the political discourse.

""We can't be bystanders to bigotry,"" Obama said.
""Together, we've got to show that America truly protects all faiths.
As we protect our country from terrorism, we should not reinforce the ideas and the rhetoric of the terrorists themselves.""

Describing conversations with young Muslim parents whose children are worried about being removed from the country, Obama demanded that people of all faiths be accepted without bias into the United States.

""You could not help but be heartbroken by their worries and their anxieties,"" Obama said of an earlier conversation with young Muslim community leaders.
""Some of them are parents, and they talked about how their children were asking, 'Are we going to be forced out of the country?
Are we going to be rounded up?
Why do people treat us like this?'
Conversations you shouldn't have to have with children.
Not in this country.""

White House officials said Obama was looking to issue a forceful counterpoint to the language favored by some Republican presidential candidates like Donald Trump, who has proposed banning all Muslims from entering the country until tighter antiterror measures are put into place.
But they also hoped to counter GOP claims that Obama hasn't been forceful enough in demanding that Muslim leaders help root out extremism.

Obama offered a calibrated message on that front Wednesday, citing the work of Islamic centers while identifying areas for improvement.

""Here at this mosque, and across our country and around the world, Muslim leaders are roundly and repeatedly and consistently condemning terrorism,"" he said.
""And around the globe, Muslims who've dared to speak out have often been targeted and even killed So those voices are there; we just have to amplify them more.""

In his speech, Obama cited a long history of Islam in America, and demanded more positive depictions of Muslims in American media.

""We have to ... lift up the contributions of the Muslim-American community not when there's a problem, but all the time.
Our television shows should have some Muslim characters that are unrelated to national security.
It's not that hard to do,"" Obama said.

Obama has visited mosques in the past, but never inside the United States , which is home to 2.75 million Muslims, according to the Pew Research Center .
Before Wednesday, many Muslim groups had called for him to schedule a stop at a U.S. mosque as a public rejection of Islamophobia, the same way President George W. Bush did in the days after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

But for Obama, who continues to be dogged by conspiracy theories that suggest he himself is a Muslim (Obama is a Christian), a stop at an Islamic center proved far more complicated the first seven years of his term.
A CNN/ORC poll in September found that 29% of Americans said they believed Obama was a Muslim, including 43% of Republicans.

He alluded to the conspiracy theories on Wednesday, saying the same rumors had plagued Thomas Jefferson.

""I am not the first,"" he said.
""I am in good company.""

During a meeting in December, Muslim community leaders lobbied top Obama aides, including senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, to schedule a visit for Obama to a U.S. mosque, an event the White House moved quickly to produce.

""For young Muslims, I feel the President's visit has a profound impact,"" said Brenda Abdelall, the charities program director at Muslim Advocates, a group that had pressed Obama to visit a mosque in the United States.
Abdelall attended Obama's address on Wednesday.

""Especially today, we worry about our own children who report being targeted.
Being present and standing together, it's not going to stop the bullying,"" she said.
But Obama's speech, she said, ""went a long way to share with everyone that Muslims are part of the fabric of America.""

Still, many Muslim-Americans on social media proclaimed Obama's visit too late in coming, using the hashtag #TooLateObama to dismiss his message as unwelcome.

Obama entered office in 2009 hoping to repair relations with Muslims abroad, who felt targeted after American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and infuriated by the use of torture on terror suspects.
Months after taking office, he fulfilled a campaign promise to deliver a speech to global followers of Islam, traveling to Cairo and insisting the U.S. seek a ""new beginning"" with Muslim countries.

While in Egypt he toured the Sultan Hassan Mosque alongside a veiled Hillary Clinton, then serving as his secretary of state.
He's also visited mosques in Jakarta, in 2010, and Kuala Lumpur, in 2014.","President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland, to rebuke ""inexcusable political rhetoric"" against Muslim-Americans, particularly from Republican presidential candidates.

Republicans counter that it would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense

Sponsor vows to bring measure back until it passes

An election-year Democratic measure designed to ensure that women don't face pay discrimination was blocked Tuesday by Republicans who complained that the bill was politically inspired and would reward trial lawyers at the expense of employers.

The motion, which needed 60 votes to succeed, got only 52, not one from a Republican.

President Obama issued a statement criticizing Republicans for putting ""partisan politics ahead of American women and families.""

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, standing at a news conference with pay equity advocate Lilly Ledbetter, accused Republicans of ""wanting to stick their heads in the sand"" about the longstanding issue of women being paid less than men.
""But it's clear where Democrats stand,"" Reid said.

The bill, which Democrats said would close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, would require employers to prove that differences in pay were related to job performance, not gender; would prevent employers from forbidding employees from sharing salary information with each other; and would allow women who believe they were discriminated against to sue for damages.

Democrats acknowledged privately that they expected to make political gains with women by pressing to close the pay gap, which they said has women earning just 77 cents on the dollar compared with men.

Republicans, fearful that Democrats were trying to portray them as insensitive to women, argued that they oppose pay discrimination but disagree with the Democrats' bill, which was written without their input.
Republicans remained largely silent about the issue in the days leading up to the vote, even as Democrats, led by the president, made an all-out push for the legislation.

Only one Republican senator, Dean Heller of Nevada, who is in a tight re-election race against Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley, spoke on the floor against the bill.
In his brief speech, Heller proposed an alternative bill to combat the problem, but Democrats criticized it as insufficient.

Off the floor, a few Republicans spoke about the bill, but only when asked by reporters.

""We think it is the wrong way of going about dealing with this issue,"" said Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, who described the measure as a reward for pro-Democratic trial lawyers.

""This is just politics.
This should be called the trial lawyers bonanza bill,"" complained Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming, the top Republican on the Senate labor committee.
""It has nothing to do with the women.
They will get very little out of it.
What it allows is huge class-action suits with very little defense by any employer.""

Even the retiring moderate Republican senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe, whose support Democrats hoped to win, called the Democrats' bill ""regrettable"" and an ""overreach.""

""I think there are other ways (of) addressing these issues, and this legislation goes too far,"" Snow said.
The bill ""would put a tremendous burden on employers through lawsuits, class-action lawsuits.""

Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, the chief sponsor of the pay equity bill, vowed to return to the bill until it passes.

""We will be back,"" she said.
""Though we lost the vote today, we are not giving up for equal pay, for equal rights.""","Democrats' election-year measure to ensure women don't face pay discrimination was blocked by Republicans, who claimed the bill would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense.

allsides_race_and_racism_l_3,allsides,"To those of us in the public health community, they are also a visceral reminder of a reality we have come to know all too well: Racism is a public health crisis.

Nowhere is that reality more gut-wrenching and visible than in the police violence that kills black Americans at nearly three times the rate of white Americans.
It is also apparent in the legacy of slavery and discrimination that persists in modern medicine and across the many social determinants of health.

Indeed, it is cruel and somewhat ironic that some are now pointing to “underlying health conditions” as a contributing factor in Floyd’s death, which has been ruled a homicide.
That line of explanation, of course, is intended to deflect blame from the officers whose actions ended his life — and goes against what millions saw plain as day on video.

But it also illuminates another way in which racism is deadly.
Across the country, black Americans suffer from higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, asthma and heart disease than white Americans.
They are more likely to be obese and get insufficient sleep, which can contribute to such health issues.
The role of racism in these underlying conditions cannot be denied.

A growing body of literature shows that social determinants — otherwise known as the conditions in which we’re born and in which we live, work and play — are key drivers of health inequities.
For generations, communities of color have faced vast disparities in job opportunities, income and inherited family wealth.
They are less likely to have housing security and access to quality schools, healthy food and green spaces.
All these factors undoubtedly undermine mental and physical well-being.

In addition to the consequences of structural racism, it is well-documented that racism itself is hard on a person’s health.
Chronic stress caused by discrimination can trigger a cascade of adverse health outcomes, from high blood pressure and heart disease to immunodeficiency and accelerated aging.
Evidence even suggests that the racism endured by black mothers contributes to the alarmingly high maternal and infant mortality rate.
Look no further than Erica Garner, Eric Garner’s daughter, who at the age of 27 went into cardiac arrest following an asthma attack.

“I can’t breathe.”

The covid-19 pandemic has laid bare many of these inequities for the world to see.
We’re now learning that Floyd tested positive for the coronavirus in early April, almost two months before his death.
All told, predominantly black counties are seeing three times the rate of infection — and six times the rate of covid-related death — as white counties.

Black and brown Americans make up a disproportionate number of essential workers who have stayed on the job through lockdowns, and thus are at higher risk of contracting the disease.
And when they do fall ill, they are more likely to receive worse care than white Americans do.
That’s true even when controlling for socioeconomic factors such as income and education.
And, of course, they are more likely to suffer from the underlying health conditions that can make this coronavirus deadly.

We see this in the striking link between long-term air pollution exposure and coronavirus deaths.
Black Americans are 75 percent more likely to live near a polluting facility, such as a factory or a refinery.
This in part explains why even before this pandemic, black children had a 500 percent higher death rate from asthma than white children.

Now, data from our school’s research show that a person who lives for decades in a county with high levels of fine particulate air pollution is 8 percent more likely to die from covid-19 than someone who lives in a place with just one unit less of such pollution.

“I can’t breathe.”

As James Baldwin wrote, “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.” It is time to face this immutable fact: Systemic racism has had its knee on the neck of the African American community since America began.
And all of us have a responsibility to acknowledge it and address it.

We have the tools to identify the many ways that decades of entrenched discrimination are hurting health and cutting lives short to this day.
And we cannot let this moment and the growing call for justice fade without making those connections clear — and pressing for meaningful policy change.","The article highlights the reality of racism as a public health crisis in the United States. It cites the police violence that disproportionately affects black Americans, as well as the legacy of slavery and discrimination that persists in modern medicine and social determinants of health.

allsides_abortion_r_1,allsides,"In its latest pro-abortion litigation effort, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves ""sanctuary cities"" for unborn children.

The ACLU brought the suit on behalf of two pro-abortion groups, the Lilith Fund and the Texas Equal Access Fund (TEA Fund), saying that their rights to free expression and association are violated by the pro-life ordinances.

The first of the ""sanctuary"" ordinances listed in Tuesday's lawsuit was passed by the city of Waskom back in June; the other listed cities which followed later are Naples, Joaquin, Tenaha, Rusk, Gary, and Wells.

According to the ACLU of Texas' news release on the lawsuit, the ordinances in question contain language that would outlaw abortion altogether within city limits if the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade is ever overturned, which the 79-page legal complaint argues ""misleads residents of these cities as to whether individuals can in fact exercise their right to access abortion.""

The lawsuit also contends that the cities' ordinances have dubbed abortion providers and pro-abortion entities as ""criminal organizations,"" which keeps them from clearing up confusion and assisting people with aborting their unborn children.

""As a result of being designated criminal, Plaintiffs are prohibited from operating, speaking, and associating within these cities,"" the lawsuit contends.
""Consequently, Plaintiffs are hampered from countering or clarifying the confusion created by the ordinances as to the legality of abortion services.""

""These ordinances are unconstitutional,"" said ACLU of Texas staff attorney Anjali Salvador in a statement.
""Abortion is legal in every state and city in the country.
Cities cannot punish pro-abortion organizations for carrying out their important work – especially when they do so in a way that violates the First Amendment.""

Mark Dickson, the director of Right to Life East Texas, has been a leading figure in the unborn sanctuary movement in the Lone Star State for months now.
Before Waskom passed its initial ordinance, he voiced his frustration to the city council that legislators in Austin weren't passing ""meaningful legislation that protects unborn life.""

""We have every intention of targeting every part of the state,"" Dickson told the Texas Tribune last month.
""Every city, no matter what size, is valuable.""

In a Tuesday facebook post, Dickson derided the ACLU's complaint as ""a meritless lawsuit brought to deter and intimidate cities from enacting these ordinances, which are entirely constitutional and consistent with the laws of Texas.""
He also said, ""We have a legal team ready to defend these ordinances at no charge to the cities, and we are prepared to defend all other cities that enact these laws at no charge to the taxpayers.""","The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves ""sanctuary cities"" for unborn children.

allsides_white_house_c_2,allsides,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said Friday it is putting new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing the Tehran government's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen.

“Iran’s continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program poses a threat to the region, to our partners worldwide, and to the United States,"" said John E. Smith, acting director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control.

Asked about Iran by reporters, Trump said simply: ""They're not behaving.""

The sanctions — which have been in the pipeline for months — said nothing about the Iranian nuclear deal, which Trump attacked during the campaign but has shown no signs of voiding.

Smith did say that ""we will continue to actively apply all available tools, including financial sanctions, to address this behavior.”

The sanctions affect 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies, freezing any property or funds they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.
The Treasury Department also said that ""U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions"" with those on the sanctions list.

Trump signaled the sanctions with an early morning tweet: ""Iran is playing with fire — they don't appreciate how ""kind"" President Obama was to them. Not me!""

In announcing earlier this week the administration had put Iran ""on notice,"" Trump and aides cited a recent ballistic missile test as well as supporting a rebel group in Yemen known as the Houthis.

The Treasury Department said in a statement that ""this action reflects the United States’ commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran with respect to its ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region.""

Iran has denied that its missile tests violate United Nations regulations and generally mocked the president over his criticism.

“This is not the first time when an inexperienced man is threatening Iran,” Ali Akbar Velayati, senior adviser to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told the Tasnim news agency this week.
“The new administration of America will realize that threatening Iran will not work, and empty and baseless ranting should be stopped.”

The financial restrictions are outside the scope of the nuclear agreement in which the United States and allies drew down sanctions on Iran as it agreed to give up the means to make nuclear weapons.
While Trump has questioned whether the agreement can be verified, the Treasury Department said these new sanctions deal with Iran's missile activity and alleged support for terrorist groups.

The agreement dealt only with nuclear-related sanctions; other restrictions involving Iranian financial transactions remain.

The sanctioned individuals and companies have been linked to Iran's missile program and/or proxies for terrorist activity, such as the Houthis, officials said.
They have been identified through an ongoing review of Iranian activity that goes back to the Obama administration.

The Treasury Department is being led by Acting Secretary Adam J. Szubin, a holdover from the Obama administration who has been involved in sanction activity.
Trump's nominee to lead the department, Steve Mnuchin, is awaiting Senate confirmation.

""These kinds of sanctions don't happen quickly,"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said, but were triggered by an Iranian missile test and terrorist activities.

Officials declined to say whether Trump plans to kill the Iranian nuclear deal — or somehow force Iran to walk away from it — but pledged to keep their eye on the regime.

Calling Iran ""the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism,"" national security adviser Michael Flynn said that ""the international community has been too tolerant of Iran’s bad behavior ..
The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate Iran’s provocations that threaten our interests.""

Lawmakers generally applauded the sanctions, but questioned some of the administration's sabre-rattling toward Iran.

""I urge the Administration to bring clarity to their overall strategy towards Iran,"" said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., ""and to refrain from ambiguous rhetoric — or provocative tweets — that will exacerbate efforts to confront those challenges.”","The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies, citing Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen.

allsides_abortion_c_2,allsides,"More than 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws and regulations that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion.

The letter appears today as a full-page ad in The New York Times under the heading ""Don't Ban Equality,"" and comes less than a month after Alabama Gov.
Kay Ivey signed the most restrictive abortion legislation in the U.S., banning doctors from performing abortion at any stage of pregnancy, punishable by 99 years in prison.
The law includes no exceptions for cases of rape or incest.

Several other states — including Georgia, Arkansas, Indiana and Missouri — have adopted similar laws this year.

Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, along with fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff, Diane Von Furstenburg and CEOs from companies including Yelp, H&M, The Body Shop and Glossier, say they signed the letter to send a clear message that restricting access to reproductive care, including abortion, is ""against our values, and is bad for business.""

Such legislation, the executives write, inhibits ""our ability to build diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines, recruit top talent across the states, and protect the well-being of all the people who keep our businesses thriving day in and day out.""

Andrea Blieden, U.S. general manager of The Body Shop tells CNBC Make It that ""access to reproductive health care is recognized as a human right"" and says the letter emphasizes the company's outlook that it is essential U.S. law ""respect, protect and fulfill the human rights of women.""

""We believe that a woman's ability to access reproductive health care is critical to her autonomy, economic success, physical and mental health and general empowerment in the workplace,"" says Blieden.
""As a brand that stands for equality and women's empowerment, we believe it's important that we take a stand and join this cause.""

Seventh Generation CEO Joey Bergstein says that now more than ever, it's essential for CEOs and executives to speak up.

""We're deep believers that companies and businesses can and must be a force for good,"" he says.
""You'll notice in our mission that we don't talk at all about selling eco-friendly home and personal care products.
We talk about the change we're trying to create in the world, and that's inclusive of social change, with this being a pivotal issue.""

A 2017 survey conducted by public relations firm Weber Shandwick found that 47% of millennials believe CEOs have a responsibility to speak up about issues that are important to society.
Additionally, 28% of Gen Xers and Boomers agreed.

In May, seven female CEOs from companies including Sustain Natural, Thinx and LOOM ran a full-page ad in The New York Times affirming abortion as healthcare and a human right, and urging other business leaders to do the same.
Entertainment companies including Disney, Netflix and WarnerMedia announced last month that they would consider ceasing production in Georgia if the state's restrictive abortion law takes effect.

""I think many people who work for us will not want to work there, and we will have to heed their wishes in that regard,"" Disney CEO Bob Iger told Reuters.
""Right now we are watching it very carefully.""

The letter that appears today in The Times was spearheaded by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Planned Parenthood Federation of America, NARAL Pro-Choice America and the Center for Reproductive Rights.
These organizations have also partnered to launch DontBanEquality.com, a site where people can learn more about the group's mission and where CEOs can add their names to the letter.

allsides_gun_control_and_gun_rights_l_4,allsides,"(CNN) As House Democrats staged a sit-in in Congress in the wake of the shooting at a nightclub this month in Orlando, the public has again been left wondering if there is any politically feasible path to dealing with this country's problem with mass shootings.

Of course, America isn't the only country to have experienced mass shootings.
Australia suffered a string of them before deciding to take action back in 1996, when it responded with a complete ban on the possession of rapid-fire rifles and overall tightening of its overall gun regulation regime.
The results have been stunning: The country has not had a single mass public shooting in 20 years.

There is no chance of such dramatic action here.
But when videos have surfaced urging extremists to take advantage of America's lax gun laws, then you know it's well past time to examine what steps can be taken to diminish the chances of more mayhem.

There are four steps the United States should be taking right now, ideas that no one -- aside from those trying to profit from gun sales -- should reasonably object to.

First, anyone who is on the "" no-fly"" list because of suspected terrorist leanings or activity should be a prohibited purchaser.
Second, federal law must require background checks for all gun sales .
These two proposals should not be treated as separate issues.
After all, implementing the first proposal without the second would be like having a screening line at the airport but making it voluntary.
Obviously, the terrorists would skip the line.
Making terrorists prohibited purchasers while allowing them to buy guns through private sales would be similarly ineffectual.

Third, the background check system needs to be strengthened by making sure all prohibited purchasers are included in the system -- and that the FBI has time to evaluate whether a purchaser is indeed legitimate.
At present, many states have failed to furnish the names of prohibited purchasers, and guns have been turned over to killers simply because the three-day mandated period for investigation was too short to ascertain the necessary facts.

nine church members a year ago in Charleston, South Carolina, will be kept from getting weapons.
I am sure legitimate purchasers will not mind the minor inconvenience of an additional day or two waiting if it means that individuals such as Dylann Roof , accused of killingnine church members a year ago in Charleston, South Carolina,will be kept from getting weapons.

Fourth, the police, prosecutors and the public must take the initiative to see that all prohibited purchasers are properly added to the rolls.
The Orlando shooter is alleged to have been a violent wife abuser.
Victims and other observers must be encouraged to bring such misconduct to the attention of the authorities so they can add such individuals to the prohibited purchaser list.

In addition to an improved and universal background check system, we must also look at a return to the federal assault weapons ban , with appropriate tightening of its many loopholes.
This is more controversial, because while few other than gun sellers oppose attempts to keep guns away from prohibited purchasers, those who like to own assault weapons will oppose restrictions that keep them from buying the weapons they want.

Why would gun sellers object to tighter laws?
The answer lies in the nature of the gun market.
Despite a recent uptick captured in a 2012 survey , hunting has declined over the past three decades , which means that gun sellers need to find ways to get people who have already bought a gun for self-protection to buy more weapons.
Since guns last for decades, there is no obvious need to buy more, so the industry tries to pump up sales by stressing the need to secure more powerful, faster-shooting weapons.

Modern assault weapons are as deadly as the machine guns used by Al Capone in the 1920s and '30s and should similarly be banned -- as should all weapons and high-capacity magazines that exceed a given threshold of deadliness because they allow for rapid fire of large numbers of particularly damaging bullets.
Since the AR-15 was designed to be as lethal as possible, it clearly falls on the wrong side of the permissible line for civilian use.

National Rifle Association darling John Lott has stated that "" 98 percent of the time that people use guns defensively, they merely have to brandish a weapon to break off an attack.""
By that reasoning, nothing more than a revolver is needed for self-defense in the overwhelming majority of cases.
The idea that assault weapons are really ""protection weapons"" permitted by the Second Amendment is not credible.","The article discusses the need for stricter gun control laws in the US following the Orlando nightclub shooting.

allsides_immigration_r_5,allsides,"Former President Obama lashed out at President Trump for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) amnesty program, which was thought to be on shaky legal ground.

Obama ripped Trump as “cruel,” lacking “basic decency” and acting “contrary to our spirit, and to common sense.” The former president claimed DACA recipients “pose no threat” and “are not taking away anything from the rest of us.” (RELATED: Sympathetic Media Scrambles To Trot Out Shiny ‘Dreamers,’ But Forgets All The Nightmares)

“To target these young people is wrong – because they have done nothing wrong.
It is self-defeating – because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love.
And it is cruel,” Obama wrote in a lengthy Facebook post, following Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ announcement that the administration would be gradually rolling back the amnesty program.

“What if our kid’s science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer?
Where are we supposed to send her?
To a country she doesn’t know or remember, with a language she may not even speak?”

“Let’s be clear: the action taken today isn’t required legally.
It’s a political decision, and a moral question.
Whatever concerns or complaints Americans may have about immigration in general, we shouldn’t threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own, who pose no threat, who are not taking away anything from the rest of us,” Obama claimed.

“They are that pitcher on our kid’s softball team, that first responder who helps out his community after a disaster, that cadet in ROTC who wants nothing more than to wear the uniform of the country that gave him a chance.
Kicking them out won’t lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone’s taxes, or raise anybody’s wages.”

allsides_coronavirus_c_1,allsides,"“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.

What’s happening

It’s a commonly accepted truth that the only way the coronavirus pandemic will come to an end is through the development of an effective vaccine.
The effort to accomplish that goal has been underway for months in countries around the world, at a scale and speed that have never been seen before.

There are currently more than 100 potential vaccines in some stage of development, some of which have advanced to human trials.
The Trump administration launched “Operation Warp Speed” in May with the goal of having millions of doses available by the end of the year.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, recently said he was “cautiously optimistic” a vaccine could be ready by early 2021.

Experts say the virus will continue to spread until about 70 percent of the population has developed immunity.
A vaccine is the quickest and safest way to establish what’s known as “herd immunity.” The other path — waiting until enough people have been infected — could lead to millions of deaths, epidemiologists say.

Why there’s debate

Despite promising progress on a number of vaccine candidates, there are still significant reasons to be skeptical of the idea that a game-changing vaccine is just a few months away, experts say.
Developing a vaccine by the end of the year or even by next summer would shatter the record for the fastest vaccine ever developed, which currently stands at four years.
Even if that extraordinary feat is accomplished, drug companies will still need to produce hundreds of millions of doses and distribute them to the people who need them.

It’s possible that will happen, but some experts worry about investing too much in what would be a best-case scenario.
“We’ve never seen everything go perfectly,” a former Trump administration health official told Congress.
A better plan, some argue, would be to prepare as if it might take years before a vaccine is widely available by developing effective systems of testing, tracing and therapeutic medicines that can last as long as they’re needed.
There is even concern that the idea of a vaccine being right around the corner may be holding back efforts to put the virus mitigation measures we need right now in place.

Others have suggested that rushing development may backfire by increasing the risk that an unsafe vaccine might be the first to make it to market.
Any setbacks could increase already pervasive anti-vaccine sentiment among the public, which may undermine herd immunity.
There is also the possibility that any new vaccine may not be entirely effective or may provide immunity only for a short period of time.

Perspectives

Vaccine skepticism may make reaching herd immunity difficult

“An approved coronavirus vaccine won’t do any good if people aren’t willing to roll up their sleeves for it.” — Editorial, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

A vaccine won’t be a magic solution, but it’s still the best path out of the pandemic

“If you’re imagining there’ll be one golden day when a vaccine is approved and the pandemic will be over — Finally!
We can all crowd into one another’s living rooms and resume choir practice again — I’m afraid it won’t be quite like that.
But it will be the beginning of the end.
There’s much to be hopeful about, and enormous challenges lie ahead.” — Caroline Chen, ProPublica

The supply chain for vaccine materials could break down

“It would be a shame if production and supply chain bottlenecks, such as the ones faced for medical supplies, slow down vaccine availability after discovery.
Production must be done globally to prevent bottlenecks, hoarding and to facilitate efficient distribution of vaccines to local clinics.” — Krishna B. Kumar, Mahshid Abir and Christopher Nelson, The Hill

Waiting on a miracle cure in the future is causing unnecessary deaths right now

“Like an overly optimistic doctor, some policymakers are banking on a future vaccine that, at best, may arrive in 2021 while people are sick and dying now and the economy continues to be hobbled with an unclear path forward to stability.
The tragedy is that there is a playbook that can reduce the number of cases and deaths right now.” — Eric Schneider, Los Angeles Times","The development of an effective vaccine is considered the only way to end the coronavirus pandemic.

allsides_lgbt_rights_r_2,allsides,"The Rev. Franklin Graham, an evangelist and the son of the late preacher Billy Graham, was slated to speak this summer at a venue in Liverpool.
That stop, though, will no longer take place.

Graham’s event, to be held at ACC Liverpool, was part of a larger tour through the United Kingdom.
Officials at the venue, however, announced Friday the event would be scrubbed from the schedule because Graham’s views — particularly his biblical interpretation of marriage as a union between one man and one woman — are “incompatible with our values.”

The Graham Tour UK event which was originally planned to take place at ACC Liverpool in June 2020 will no longer be going ahead.

The decision to cancel Graham’s stop in Liverpool isn’t surprising.
Protesters have been rebuking the leaders of the venue for allowing Graham to share the Gospel in the space.

One group critical of Graham’s slated appearance at ACC Liverpool was the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, which referred to the evangelist as “a homophobic hate preacher.”

Petition by our Liverpool Branch members who are asking for support from their locally elected council representatives in response to the platforming of homophobic hate preacher Franklin Graham at the M&S Arena on the 12th of June 2020.

How has Graham replied?

On Monday afternoon, Graham replied to the decision by ACC Liverpool.

He penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community in the U.K., informing them he is coming to Great Britain not to condemn them.
Rather, he is coming to present the Gospel.

Graham did, though, admit he does see homosexuality as a sin.

“The rub, I think, comes in whether God defines homosexuality as sin,” he wrote.
“The answer is yes.
But God goes even further than that, to say that we are all sinners — myself included.
The Bible says that every human being is guilty of sin and in need of forgiveness and cleansing.
The penalty of sin is spiritual death — separation from God for eternity.”

Graham also defended the right to free speech and religious liberty.
He wrote he is not coming to the U.K. “to speak against anybody” because the Gospel “is inclusive.”

“I’m coming to speak for everybody,” he added.
“The Gospel is inclusive.
I’m not coming out of hate, I’m coming out of love.”

allsides_immigration_l_1,allsides,"Immigrants are the common denominator when it comes to America's ""greatness.""

Contrary to Donald Trump’s incessant anti-immigrant rhetoric, the truth is America would not have been possible without immigrants.
Indeed, immigrants not only helped build what Ronald Reagan once famously called a “shining city upon a hill”—they’ve sustained it.
And no amount of bluster will ever change that.

Immigrants, regardless of status, introduce specialized skills.
In fact, some of America’s most profitable and celebrated companies, including Budweiser and McDonald’s, were either founded by immigrants or offspring of immigrants.
Likewise, thousands of new immigrant-founded businesses venture into the American marketplace to compete and accommodate consumers each year.

According to a report by Partnership for a New American Economy, roughly 40 percent of all Fortune 500 businesses can directly or indirectly trace their beginnings to somebody that immigrated to the United States from another part of the world.
These businesses have produced millions of jobs and countless services.
More precisely, immigrant-founded businesses sell $857 billion in goods annually and employ almost 4 million workers.

Critics, of course, often ignore this aspect of immigration.
Instead they argue undocumented immigrants abuse domestic social programs such as Medicare.
But a study in the journal Health Affairs found undocumented immigrants pay $13.8 billion more into Medicare than they receive, resulting in a surplus.
By comparison, native-born residents receive $30.9 billion more than they contribute, resulting in a deficit.

Other critics correlate crime and immigration as if artificial lines in the sand determine a human’s propensity for wrongdoing.
But a 2008 study by the Public Policy Institute of California—a state that is home to one of the highest undocumented immigrant populations in the country—found native-born males are 10 times more likely to end up incarcerated than their foreign-born counterparts.

The true danger to native-born citizens is not the foreign-born or prospective citizen, but the current U.S. citizenship process, which continues to remain unnecessarily bureaucratic and convoluted.
As a consequence, applicants often fall through administrative cracks or linger on paperwork for years, incentivizing unlawful or desperate alternatives.

History is full of examples of underground economies that created unintended social consequences.
Look no further than prohibition and the rise of organized crime during the 1920s.
It’s only reasonable to assume public safety and health risks will increase as human smuggling is encouraged and prolonged.

For this reason, rounding up 11 million undocumented immigrants is impractical, and calls for increased government spending are irresponsible in a nation that’s already drowning in debt.
Building a wall merely translates into yet another pointless—taxpayer subsidized—government project.
Moreover, most immigrants not only reside in the U.S. lawfully, but many of those who reside in the U.S. unlawfully simply overstayed their visas.

The average immigrant, both documented and undocumented, comes to the United States for freedom and opportunity: a chance to flee economic or political hardship and take part in the American dream.
Native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome them, not disparage them.

Immigrants are what made America great in the past.
And immigrants are what will make America great again in the future.","The article argues that immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric.

allsides_gun_control_and_gun_rights_c_5,allsides,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas (Reuters) - The former U.S. serviceman who committed the deadliest mass shooting on record in Texas escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 as he faced court-martial on domestic violence charges for which he was later convicted, a police report revealed on Tuesday.

The report also disclosed that police who were alerted to Devin Kelley’s escape were advised that he posed a “danger to himself and others” after being “caught sneaking firearms” onto the U.S. Air Force base in New Mexico where he was stationed.

The person who reported the escape, according to the report, further warned that Kelley, then aged 21, had been “attempting to carry out death threats” against his military commanders and “suffered from mental disorders.”

He was apprehended without incident at an El Paso, Texas, bus station shortly after he had run off, according to a police report filed in that city.

Kelley’s troubled Air Force background has been a focus of investigators in the tiny Texas town of Sutherland Springs since he stormed into a church there on Sunday with a semi-automatic assault rifle and opened fire on worshipers.

Authorities have said 26 people were killed in the assault, including the unborn child of a pregnant woman who was among the dead.
Another 20 people were wounded, half of them still listed in critical condition as of Tuesday.

Officials said Kelley, 26, killed himself during a failed getaway attempt after he was wounded by an armed civilian who tried to stop him.
Two handguns belonging to the killer also were recovered.

A major sporting goods dealer in San Antonio later confirmed that Kelley twice passed a required criminal background check when he bought guns there during the past year, despite having a criminal record that should have prevented those purchases.

Kelley was found guilty by court-martial in 2012 of assaulting his first wife and a stepson while serving at Holloman Air Force Base, where he was assigned to a logistics readiness unit, the Pentagon reported on Monday.

But the Air Force also acknowledged it inexplicably failed to enter his conviction into a government database that all licensed firearms dealers are required to use to screen prospective gun buyers for their criminal history.

Federal law prohibits anyone from selling a gun to someone who has been convicted of a crime involving domestic violence against a spouse or child.

On Capitol Hill, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas, called the failure to transmit Kelley’s record into the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC) system an “appalling” lapse.

The Air Force has opened an inquiry into the matter, and the U.S. Defense Department has requested a review by its inspector general to ensure other criminal cases have been reported correctly, Pentagon officials said.

Two U.S. senators, Republican Jeff Flake of Arizona and Democratic Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, said they planned to co-sponsor legislation aimed at ensuring that anyone convicted of domestic violence, whether in civilian or military court, would be blocked from legally purchasing a gun.

Firearms experts said the case involving Kelley, who spent a year in military detention before his bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014, exposed a previously unnoticed weak link in the system of background checks.

Crosses are seen near a vigil at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland.

BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS AS STUDENT

Texas public school records also showed Kelley had numerous behavior problems as a student, including nine suspensions for such issues as drugs, insubordination, profanity, skipping classes and dishonesty between sixth grade and high school graduation.

His private adult life appears to have likewise been marked by turbulence.

After divorcing the woman he was convicted of assaulting, Kelley remarried in 2014, but authorities have said he became embroiled in some unspecified domestic dispute with her parents that involved him sending threatening text messages to his mother-in-law.

Kelley’s in-laws occasionally attended services at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs but were not there when he attacked worshipers during Sunday prayers, authorities said.

“We have some indication of what the conflict was between the family,” Freeman Martin, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, told a Tuesday news conference.
It was not clear what role, if any, the dispute played as a motivating factor in Sunday’s violence.

Kelley’s cell phone was sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s crime lab at Quantico, Virginia, but specialists were not immediately able to gain electronic access to the device, said Christopher Combs, the FBI’s special agent in charge in San Antonio.

The massacre, which ranked as the deadliest mass shooting by a single gunman in Texas history, and one of the five most lethal ever in the United States, rekindled an ongoing debate over gun ownership, which is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Guns are part of the fabric of life in rural areas.

U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters he believed stricter reviews of gun purchases would not have stopped Sunday’s rampage.

“There would have been no difference,” Trump said during a visit to South Korea.
He added that stricter gun laws might have prevented the man who shot Kelley from acting as he did.
“You would have had hundreds more dead.”","A police report revealed that Devin Kelley, the former US serviceman who committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas, escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial on domestic violence charges.

What’s happening

Former national security adviser John Bolton’s upcoming book contains a long list of scathing accusations against President Trump, according to several news organizations that obtained copies.

In the book, Bolton portrays Trump as a man unfit for the presidency who consistently made decisions based on how they could help his reelection chances rather than what was in the best interest of the country.
Accusations by Bolton include Trump asking for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsing China’s use of prison camps for Muslims, speaking about executing journalists and a firsthand account of Trump’s dealings with Ukraine that were at the center of the impeachment saga.

The president called the book “a compilation of lies and made up stories” from a former staffer who was “just trying to get even” for being fired.
At the same time, the Trump administration took legal action to block its release over claims that it contains classified information.
A federal judge on Saturday ruled in Bolton’s favor.

Bolton became Trump’s third national security adviser in April 2018.
Bolton either resigned or was fired, depending on who you ask, in September 2019 after reportedly clashing with the president on a number of foreign policy issues.
House Democrats chose not to subpoena Bolton as a witness during their impeachment inquiry, largely over concerns that it would spark a protracted legal battle.
Republicans in the Senate declined to seek his testimony as well.

Why there’s debate

The flood of claims made in Bolton’s book has prompted strong reactions across the political spectrum.
Trump’s allies have been quick to echo his criticisms of Bolton and have attempted to undercut the claims made in the book.
Bolton has also received significant criticism from liberals, who say he put personal profit over the country’s interest by using his claims to sell a book rather than sharing them publicly months ago.

The accusations could have been especially impactful during the impeachment trial, Democrats argue.
Though his testimony may not have compelled GOP senators to remove Trump from office, Bolton could have told his extensive account of the president’s wrongdoing, which may have done severe political damage to Trump, they argue.
Sharing his story now — in the midst of a health crisis and a national movement for racial justice — makes the revelations largely irrelevant, some argue.

Others say that the book could still be impactful, despite Bolton’s apparent motives.
It contains allegations of severe violations by the president that may resonate with voters who are already discontent with his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and protests, some argue.
Bolton’s claims that Trump took a conciliatory approach to China, specifically, could undercut the president’s attempts to sell himself as a strong adversary to Beijing.

What’s next

Bolton’s book is scheduled for release on June 23.
Democrats in the House are considering whether to seek testimony from Bolton in light of the new allegations, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday.

Perspectives

The claims will hurt Republican senators seeking reelection

“The ones who really will suffer, deservedly so, from Bolton’s account are the Republican senators who refused to hear his testimony and then voted to acquit (for lack of evidence, some said).
Bolton’s book confirms how much harder it would have been for them to let Trump off the hook had a longtime conservative known for copious note-taking been called to testify.” — Jennifer Rubin, Washington Post

The accusations are significant, despite Bolton’s self-serving actions

“The bottom line is that while Bolton offers a portrait of Trump that is politically and personally self-serving, it is also indispensable, jaw-dropping, and more specific about high-level wrongdoing than the many embittered memoirs and background gripes to journalists that preceded it.” — Susan B. Glasser, New Yorker

Bolton’s claims wouldn’t have changed the impeachment saga at all

“The key argument that Republican opponents of impeachment made was that lawful behavior by a president, however objectionable, could not be a legitimate basis for impeachment.
To the extent it was a valid defense against impeachment over Ukraine, it would have been an equally valid defense against impeachment over anything Bolton says here.” — Ramesh Ponnuru, National Review","Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, portraying him as unfit for the presidency and making decisions based on reelection chances rather than the country's best interest.

allsides_violence_in_america_r_5,allsides,"President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee Thursday “heartbreaking” and pleaded for Americans not to jump to conclusions, but Republicans were already blaming him for what investigators termed domestic terrorism, as the shooting quickly became part of the 2016 presidential campaign.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who is seeking the GOP nomination, said the killing appeared to be terrorism, and said Mr. Obama needs confront the dangers posed by the “evil” of jihadists.

“This shooting underscores the grave reality of the threat posed to us by radical Islamic terrorism every single day,” the governor said.
“It’s time for the White House to wake up and tell the truth and the truth is that radical Islam is at war with us, and we must start by being honest about that.”

With the Islamic State holding ground in Iraq and Syria, questions still swirling about the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, and lone-wolf incidents seemingly on the rise at home, terrorism is shaping up to be a major part of the presidential debate, and Mr. Obama’s policies will be at the root of that.

The shooting also reignited the debate over guns at military facilities, after officials acknowledged troops at the Naval Reserve center where the murders took place were prohibited from being armed.
One advocacy group said the killings should force a change in that policy.

The president kept politics out of his own brief remarks Thursday evening.

“I speak for the American people in expressing our deepest condolences,” Mr. Obama said.

He also asked Americans to wait for more facts about the shooting, and did not use the word “terror” to describe the attack.

“We take all shootings very seriously,” he said in the Oval Office, soon after returning from a visit to a federal prison in Oklahoma.
“Obviously, when you have an attack on a U.S. military facility, then we have to make sure that we have all the information necessary to make an assessment in terms of how this attack took place, and what further precautions we can take in the future.
And as we have more information, we’ll let the public know.”

The FBI identified the gunman as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a 2012 graduate of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, and said he shot at a military recruiting center in Chattanooga before heading to a Navy operations support center seven miles away, where he shot and killed the four Marines before being killed himself.

Early news reports said Abdulazeez was born in Kuwait but was a naturalized U.S. citizen.

“While it would be premature to speculate on the motives of the shooter at this time, we will conduct a thorough investigation of this tragedy and provide updates as they are available,” the FBI said.

But U.S. Attorney Bill Killian told reporters that authorities were treating the shooting as an “act of domestic terrorism.”

Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said he’d been briefed and it was too early to say whether the gunman had ties to al Qaeda or the Islamic State.

“We will, of course, be investigating whether these acts were the result of online propaganda or other extremist influence,” he said.

Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said the attacks are a reminder “that there are people right here in America who are intent on striking from within.”

“We must remain vigilant in our efforts to counter the evil and twisted ideology that drives vulnerable minds into unconscionable acts of violence and hate,” he said.

The threat from the Islamic State is growing.
Federal authorities have charged 62 people with planning attacks on the homeland on behalf of the Islamic State or trying to provide material support to the terror group.
Authorities filed charges against 13 people in 2014 and 49 in 2015, according to data compiled by The Washington Times.

Of the 49 charged this year, 28 were young men between the ages of 17 and 25, according to the data.
About 30 percent were foreign-born individuals who either had permanent residency or had become naturalized citizens.

Six of the foreign-born supporters hailed from Bosnia, four of them came from Uzbekistan, one came from Kazakhstan, one was born in Syria and another was born in Iraq.

An internal congressional document shows that federal authorities have uncovered more U.S.-based terror plots or attacks in the first half of 2015 than in any year since terrorist drove planes into the New York City World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001.

Thursday’s shooting bore a resemblance to other gun attacks from earlier in Mr. Obama’s tenure.
In 2009, a man did a drive-by shooting of an Army recruiting office in Little Rock, Ark., killing one soldier and wounding another.
The shooter was a convert to Islam.

Also in 2009, an Army major who’d been in contact with Anwar al-Awlaki, a wanted terrorist suspect, killed 13 people and wounded dozens more in a shooting at Fort Hood in Texas.
The Obama administration officially labeled that killing workplace violence.

Mr. Jindal on Thursday said that designation is part of the problem.

“This is grotesque.
You cannot defeat evil until you admit that it exists,” he said.

On Capitol Hill, lawmakers were already engaged in a debate over how the federal government confronts violent extremists.

Democrats say white supremacists and anti-government extremists have posed more of a danger than radicalized Muslims, and questioned whether the government was putting its efforts in the right place.","President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee ""heartbreaking"" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions.

allsides_politics_l_4,allsides,"An apparent attempt to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against special counsel Robert Mueller collapsed spectacularly Tuesday, and may have landed some conservative activists in hot water with the FBI.

“When we learned last week of allegations that women were offered money to make false claims about the Special Counsel, we immediately referred the matter to the FBI for investigation,” Mueller’s spokesperson said in a statement.

Exactly what was going on remains unclear — including the object of the apparent scheme.
But it spilled into public view after pro-Trump Twitter personality Jacob Wohl ominously suggested Monday night that a story about such allegations was coming, and journalists who had heard about this shady operation reacted with alarm on Twitter, saying it seemed to be a smear attempt.

The key people involved to some extent appear to be:

Jacob Wohl: a 20-year-old conservative who’s most famous for sending speedy sycophantic replies to Trump’s tweets and making implausible, factually dubious claims.
He also ran some shady hedge funds.

a 20-year-old conservative who’s most famous for sending speedy sycophantic replies to Trump’s tweets and making implausible, factually dubious claims.
He also ran some shady hedge funds.
Jack Burkman: a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist who has repeatedly made false claims to have bombshell political information (such as a mystery witness proving DNC staffer Seth Rich was murdered by the government, or someone who would come forward accusing a member of Congress of sexual harassment).

What happened

The gist is that Wohl, Burkman, or both may have been involved in a plot to drum up these allegations.
Or they may have just been trolling the media.
Or Wohl might even have been tricking Burkman on some level.

What we know so far is that: This was an embarrassingly thin scam

This caused the whole matter to spill out into public, and internet sleuths began to dig into Surefire Intelligence, the supposed private intelligence company investigating these allegations.

Wohl was publicly cagey about his involvement in Surefire or the plot generally.
But Burkman freely told Hill Reporter that “Surefire is a real company” run by “Jacob Wohl.” And after journalists and online researchers got to work, it started to look like Surefire was ... Jacob Wohl, and only Jacob Wohl.

So, it looks like Surefire is essentially Better Call Saul’s Jimmy McGill doing a series of different voices over the phone to convince prosecutors that a whole church congregation supports his client.
It is not clear if Burkman, who insisted Surefire was “real,” is also being tricked, or if he is a willing participant in this scam.

Nonetheless, on Tuesday afternoon, the far-right conspiracist website Gateway Pundit, for which Wohl writes, posted a heavily redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller.
The name of the document’s author was blacked out, but it used a slogan that was also on the Surefire website.
Then, after much Twitter mockery, Gateway Pundit’s Jim Hoft took the document down and said he was “looking into” the “serious allegations against Jacob Wohl.”

Now, it’s in the FBI’s hands.
“When we learned last week of allegations that women were offered money to make false claims about the Special Counsel, we immediately referred the matter to the FBI for investigation,” Mueller’s spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday.

If this is just trolling, then it sort of worked

Wohl may end up being the ultimate loser in this scenario, depending on what the FBI finds.
But if the purpose of the scam was as much to troll journalists as to smear Mueller and the investigation, then in a way, he’s already won.

Yes, Mueller’s office commented on the allegations and “made news” by saying they’d referred the allegations to the FBI.
Still, NBC News, the Atlantic, the Daily Beast, BuzzFeed News, the New York Times, and several other media outlets (including, now, Vox) wrote articles about this nonsense — if only to debunk Wohl’s claims.
By doing so, they devoted scarce journalistic resources to this topic rather than others, just days before the midterm elections.

allsides_abortion_l_3,allsides,"The Trump administration in March released a final rule barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from getting federal family planning funds.

The rule was soon challenged in court by state officials and reproductive rights groups and has been the subject of a legal battle ever since.
Most recently, on July 3, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a preliminary injunction blocking the rule from taking effect while legal challenges work their way through the courts.

The new rule, first proposed last year, is known by some reproductive rights advocates as the “domestic gag rule.” It bars Planned Parenthood and any other provider that performs abortions or offers abortion referrals from receiving funding under Title X, which pays for birth control and other family planning services for low-income patients.

Anti-abortion groups have long backed such a rule, arguing that organizations that provide abortion should not receive federal support.
But Planned Parenthood and other groups say that the rule will leave low-income patients without access to health care they need.
Planned Parenthood says it sees about 41 percent of patients who get family planning services under Title X.

The rule immediately faced legal challenges from Planned Parenthood, the American Medical Association, the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA), the American Civil Liberties Union, and a number of states.
Earlier this year, the challengers won temporary injunctions keeping the rule from taking effect, but those injunctions were lifted after the Trump administration appealed.
On July 3, the Ninth Circuit issued a new injunction, this one in connection with the suit by the NFPRHA and ACLU.

“Today’s ruling is an important victory in the fight against the Trump administration’s attempts to upend Title X,” said Ruth Harlow, senior staff attorney for the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement.
“It allows us to go back to court to ensure that the millions of low-income people who rely on the nation’s only family planning program will continue to receive vital health services — and we will not give up until the rule is blocked for good.”

The move to restrict Title X funds is one of a number of actions by the Trump administration that critics say will limit access to contraception and abortion.
It also comes as the president ramps up his rhetoric on abortion, which he may see as a winning issue for him and the Republican Party in 2020.

The rule bars Title X recipients from performing abortions

The new rule would require providers that receive Title X funds be both physically and financially separate from any entity that provides or refers for abortions.
That means that because some Planned Parenthood health centers perform abortions, all Planned Parenthood centers would be barred from getting Title X funding.

In addition to Planned Parenthood affiliates, Title X funds also go to Health Department centers, hospital-run clinics, and other facilities, all of which would be barred from performing abortions under the new rule.

Providers were already banned from using Title X money to pay for abortions, but Title X funding recipients could still perform abortions if they covered the costs with other funds.

The rule was first proposed in May 2018 but did not go into effect at that time.
When it was finalized, the rule was scheduled to take effect this May.

A similar rule was proposed under President Reagan but was only in effect for a month, in 1992.
That rule prohibited Title X recipients from even discussing abortion, as Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael D. Shear note at the New York Times, but the new rule does not go that far.

Abortion opponents have applauded the rule.
“We thank President Trump for taking decisive action to disentangle taxpayers from the big abortion industry led by Planned Parenthood,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List, in a statement.

“Americans United for Life is pleased that HHS has taken steps to stop Title X funds from subsidizing abortion,” Catherine Glenn Foster, president of the group, said in a statement.

But Planned Parenthood and other groups say it will leave many low-income patients without access to contraceptive care.
Planned Parenthood also argues that the rule is illegal, since it violates laws requiring that pregnant patients receiving care through Title X get unbiased counseling about all of their options, which include abortion.

“The gag rule is unconscionable and unethical,” said Dr. Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement to media when a draft of the rule was published in February.
“This rule compromises the oath that I took to serve patients and help them with making the best decision for their own health.”

In many places, Planned Parenthood is the only option for low-income patients; a 2015 analysis by the Guttmacher Institute found 103 counties where Planned Parenthood is the only provider of publicly funded contraceptives.
If Planned Parenthood were locked out of Title X funds, other health centers might struggle to pick up the slack.
According to another Guttmacher analysis, other providers would have to increase their caseloads by an average of 70 percent to serve all the patients currently seen by Planned Parenthood.

“If fully implemented, the proposed changes to Title X would shrink the network of participating providers and have major repercussions for low-income women across the country that rely on them for their family planning care,” wrote a team from the Kaiser Family Foundation in a November 2018 analysis of the proposed rule.

The Title X rule is just one of several moves by the Trump administration that limit access to contraception or abortion.
In 2017, for instance, the administration released interim rules allowing almost any employer to get an exemption from the Obama-era requirement that employers offer contraceptive coverage as part of employee health insurance.
Those rules were finalized in 2018, one day after the midterm elections.

Trump has stepped up his anti-abortion rhetoric in recent months, after Virginia Gov.
Ralph Northam’s confusing comments on a bill in his state led to a larger controversy around abortions late in pregnancy.
The president’s appointment of conservative Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh has boosted his popularity among conservatives, according to Vivian Wang of the New York Times.
And with a potential challenge to Roe v. Wade on the horizon, Trump may see opposition to abortion — and to Planned Parenthood — as a winning strategy going into 2020.","The Trump administration's ""domestic gag rule"" has been blocked by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, preventing clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds.

allsides_us_senate_r_5,allsides,"Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham suggested Sunday that he would try to hold up the appointment of President Obama’s nominees to run the CIA and the Defense Department until the White House provides more details about what the president and other top administration officials were doing the night of the Benghazi terror attacks.

The South Carolina senator is among congressional Republicans most critical of Defense Department nominee Chuck Hagel and the White House’s handling of the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya.
The attacks killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

“I don’t think we should allow … Hagel to be confirmed secretary of Defense until the White House gives us an accounting,” Graham said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “Did the White House ever pick up the phone and call anyone in the Libyan government to help these folks?”

Graham said he would do the same with the Senate confirmation hearing for John Brennan, the president’s chief counterterrorism adviser, to run the CIA.

“No confirmation without information,” he said.

Though Graham has not threatened to filibuster the Hagel nomination in the Democrat-controlled chamber, he has tried several other aggressive-but-less-drastic moves.
He has called on Obama to withdraw the nomination and has successfully demanded that outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta testify on Benghazi before a vote on Hagel.

On Sunday, Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Inhofe threatened on Fox News to filibuster the Hagel nomination, in an effort to make Hagel get 60 votes, note just the 51 majority, to be confirmed.

Democrats support the president’s nomination, but Republicans appear largely opposed to voting for Hagel, a former Nebraska Republican senator, largely over concerns about his support of Israel and whether he would back U.S. military action to stop Iran from producing a nuclear weapon.

Graham began making his case last week for more details about the White House response on the night of the attacks.

He vowed Friday to hold Obama ""accountable"" for his leadership during the incident, following Panetta and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey’s Senate testimony a day earlier.

Panetta and Dempsey testified that they had just one phone conversation with Obama on the day of the attacks that started at about 5 p.m. ET and lasted for about 30 minutes, which prompted Graham to ask why no follow-up calls took place.

Graham said Thursday on Fox News that the White House has so far “delayed, denied, deceived and stonewalled.
And this has to come to an end.
Obama has to account for his leadership.""

He said Sunday that another remaining question is whether the president pressed the Libyan government to let a response team purportedly deployed from Tripoli to leave a Libyan airport to get to the U.S. outpost, which was under attack for about eight hours.

“We know nothing about what the president did during the night of Sept. 11 during a night of national crisis,” Graham said.

Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed also appeared on the show and called Graham’s actions “unprecedented.” He also said Graham dwelling on the tragedy to block nominations was “not appropriate.”","Republican Sen.

allsides_lgbt_rights_c_1,allsides,"Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019.

When Julie Berman came up to the open mic at the trans day of remembrance event on Nov. 20, 2017, she delivered a speech about transphobia in Toronto.
She talked about a trans friend of hers that was murdered.

On Sunday, a little over two years later, the trans woman and activist was assaulted and murdered.

“It’s really heartbreaking ... the same thing that she was trying to be vocal about happened to her,” said Davina Hader, a friend of the victim and a member of The 519, an organization that advocates for the inclusion of LGBTQ communities’ members and provides services for them.

Ms. Berman had asked her friend, who was filming the vigil in 2017, not to release the clip online.
“I have that still, and I was thinking about releasing [the video],” Ms. Hader said.

Toronto police said they found Ms. Berman on Sunday suffering from head injuries in a residence in Toronto’s Brunswick Avenue and Harbord Street area.
She was transported to hospital and pronounced dead.
Police have charged Colin Harnack, 29, of Toronto, with second-degree murder.

The suspect is not a known member of the LGBTQ community, according to Ms. Hader.

Through her activism, Ms. Berman was asking her community members to be more vigilant, Ms. Hader said.
In the 2017 event, “She was talking about another close friend who had been murdered ... It’s very emotional.”

Ms. Berman used to be a hairdresser and was involved for almost three decades with community events at The 519.
“She was struggling to survive as we all do,” Ms. Hader said.
“It’s very unfortunate, very sad.”

According to a study published in 2015 by Trans PULSE project that is led by professors in different universities in Ontario, trans people are targets of specifically directed violence.
The study states that 20 per cent of Ontario’s trans people had been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans and another 34 per cent had been verbally threatened or harassed but not assaulted.

The study noted that many trans people did not report these assaults to the police, but didn’t explain why.
However, the same study said 24-per-cent reported having been harassed by police.

“I don’t know that [trans women] ever felt safe,” said Olivia Nuamah, the executive director of Pride Toronto, “For many in the trans community, sadly, violence is a part of life.”

In the past couple of years, there have been three violent deaths in Toronto’s trans community, Ms. Nuamah said.
“Never mind what’s going on in North America more broadly.”

Among those fatalities in Toronto was the death of Alloura Wells, who died in June, 2017, but she was not reported missing until Nov. 6, 2017, and her body was not identified until Nov. 23 of that year.

Both Toronto Police Service and The 519 community centre in the Church-Wellesley Village were criticized for the way they handled communication in the case of Ms. Wells – a homeless, biracial transgender woman and, by extension, one of the city’s most vulnerable people.

Since then, Toronto Pride and The 519 have organized multiple events and workshops to provide education and support for the trans community members.
Many other non-profit organizations are running support programs, anti-violence programs and counselling programs, Ms. Nuamah said.

“For sure they’re nowhere near enough and the result often is many within the trans community are left vulnerable,” Ms. Nuamah said.

The trans march that is organized during Toronto Pride celebrations in June is one of the largest in the world.
“This city, and country, try to be welcoming to all members of LGBTQ2+ community,” Ms. Nuamah said.
“Our people participate in our events precisely to show that they are a strong community and also to raise awareness.”

Ms. Nuamah considers the Sunday murder to be an alarming incident that should remind everyone about the high rates of violence the trans community experiences.

Ms. Berman was a lovely person who was committed to the political issues that are facing her community, Ms. Nuamah said.

allsides_us_senate_c_2,allsides,"WASHINGTON – House Democrats introduced a bill Tuesday that would grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, but the fate of those Dreamers will ultimately rest in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have struggled for nearly two decades to come up with a solution that they, and their conservative base, can endorse.

There used to be a time when the DREAM Act was accepted by a wide range of Senate Republicans who said it was unfair to punish children for the actions of their parents.
The 2003 version of the bill was sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and had 12 other GOP co-sponsors.

But little by little, as the party's more conservative wing began viewing the DREAM Act less as an act of ""compassion"" and more an act of ""amnesty,"" the GOP has backed away from the idea.
The 2005 version of the bill had nine Republican co-sponsors, the 2007 version had five, the 2009 version had two, and the 2011 version had none.

The tide had changed so drastically by 2017 that most Senate Republicans quickly tweeted statements supporting President Donald Trump after he announced his decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, the Obama-era program that protected more than 800,000 Dreamers from deportation.

That decision was blocked by federal courts, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo and prompting the push by House Democrats to pass a permanent legislative fix for them.
Its prospects in today's Senate GOP caucus appear dire.

Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana who served 36 years in the Senate, was an early and consistent supporter of the DREAM Act.
He said that even in the early days of the bill, before the tea party movement and the Freedom Caucus and Trump's zealous band of followers, Republicans agonized between their personal belief that Dreamers were entitled to citizenship and their political concerns over supporting any form of ""amnesty.""

That internal battle has only become more acute, Lugar said, as polarization has intensified between the parties and within the Republican Party itself.
That leaves senators seeing little payoff to support the DREAM Act and all kinds of risks.

""It's a situation where members decide this is not an issue that they're prepared to bleed and die on,"" Lugar said.
""There are several out there that support it, but this doesn't appear to be the time.""

Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., paused Tuesday after USA TODAY asked if he believed the Senate should take up the House bill to protect Dreamers.
""I'm actually very pro-Dreamers,"" he said, but he wouldn’t say how he’d vote on a stand-alone bill because he hadn’t seen details.

Many of his colleagues are more direct, saying a stand-alone Dreamer bill has no chance.
Instead, the White House and most Republicans have endorsed a Dreamer fix only in exchange for billions of dollars in border security or wholesale changes of the legal immigration system.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who chairs the Judiciary Committee and has long been vocal about the need to protect Dreamers, told USA TODAY on Tuesday that he thinks the Senate should ""see if we can find a more comprehensive solution"" over the House bill.

""The immigration quagmire has changed,"" Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said when asked what shifted within his party.
""Everybody is going to have to give something in order to make progress, that's what's changed.""

The House bill, known as the Dream and Promise Act and co-sponsored by more than 190 Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, would create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and foreigners with Temporary Protected Status, or TPS.

That program has allowed more than 300,000 foreigners to legally live and work in the USA after their home countries were ravaged by war or natural disasters.
The Trump administration tried to end that program for 98 percent of the TPS population, but was blocked by federal courts.

Although the measure is likely to sail through the Democratic-controlled House, it stands little chance in the Republican-led Senate.

Few in that chamber have experienced the Republican shift as much as Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.
The Cuban-American was once a member of the bipartisan ""Gang of 8,"" which passed a bill in 2013 that would have allowed all the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants to apply for citizenship in exchange for improved border security.
At the time, it was the Republican-led House that killed the bill.

After taking a beating in conservative circles for his embrace of ""amnesty,"" Rubio has taken a more hard-line stance on immigration-related issues.
Tuesday, he told USA TODAY the stand-alone House bill to protect Dreamers had no chance in the Senate.

""You can't bring it up, because once you do, it will be amended, and it becomes a vehicle for multiple amendments outside of the DREAM Act,"" Rubio said.
""That’s why dealing with immigration has been so difficult.

allsides_politics_r_5,allsides,"The former Trump campaign adviser who accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians is a “proactive cooperator” with federal investigators, according to court documents unveiled on Monday.

The term, which refers to George Papadopoulos, generated speculation that the 30-year-old energy consultant has worn a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the presidential campaign.

The reference to Papadopoulos’ status is found in a court filing submitted by prosecutors asking a federal judge to seal court filings in the case on the basis that “premature disclosure” of his arrest “would significantly undermine his ability to serve as a proactive cooperator.”

The website Hot Air explored the meaning of the term, and pointed to a 2001 federal court case which explained that “proactive cooperation is generally understood to mean that the defendant will engage in some type of undercover work on behalf of the Government, such as wearing a wire and/or meeting face to face with persons suspected of involvement in criminal activity.”

At a plea hearing held on Oct. 5, Aaron Zelinsky, a prosecutor in the Office of the Special Counsel, shed light on Papadopoulos’ cooperation.
Zelinsky said that at Papadopoulos’ sentencing, prosecutors would make note of his “efforts to cooperate with the Government” as long as he continued “to meet with and provide information to the Government on request.”

Papadopoulos was arrested on July 27 on charges that he lied to FBI agents during a Jan. 27 interview.
Agents met with Papadopoulos as part of the bureau’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

As part of his plea deal, Papadopoulos acknowledged that he lied to agents during that meeting about his interactions with three Russian nationals.
Papadopoulos initially claimed that he knew the Russians prior to joining the Trump campaign on March 6, 2016.
But investigators obtained Papadopoulos’ emails and social media exchanges, which showed that he was lying.

Papadopoulos discussed arranging meetings between Russian government officials and the Trump campaign.
One of Papadopoulos’ contacts, a London-based professor, also told him in April that the Russian government had obtained “thousands” of Hillary Clinton’s emails.

The White House on Monday downplayed the revelations, saying that Papadopoulos played a small part on the campaign and that the Trump team did not collude with the Russian government.

Papadopoulos’ Oct. 5 plea deal and his earlier arrest remained a closely held secret until Monday, just hours after Mueller’s office unsealed an indictment against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business associate, Rick Gates.

Manafort and Gates are charged with money laundering and conspiracy.
The indictment provides no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

The revelation that Papadopoulos was serving as a “proactive cooperator” touched off widespread speculation about how much he had done to help the Mueller team.

Ron Hosko, a former assistant director of the FBI’s criminal division, says that it is possible that Papadopoulos wore a wire as part of his cooperation agreement.

“I think it’s a fair assessment that it means Mueller and Co. might have been working with [Papadopoulos] to engage other subjects in conversation along the lines suggested in the article,” said Hosko, referring to the Hot Air article which discussed the possibility of Papadopoulos wearing a wire.

Recordings of Papadopoulos’ conversations could have then been used to approach additional subjects.

On CNN, legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said that the government’s disclosure strongly suggests that Papadopoulos was wearing a wire or recording conversations with Trump associates.

“What this says to me is that Papadopoulos between July and October was wearing a wire.
He was recording conversations secretly with people who are subjects and targets of this investigation,” he said, adding that “that’s the only reasonable explanation of what’s in those court papers.”

“If he was wearing a wire, this summer and fall, think about that, just weeks ago, that is a whole new chapter of possibilities in this investigation and potentially a very, very big deal.”","Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos has been cooperating with federal investigators as a ""proactive cooperator"" since his arrest in July.

allsides_us_house_r_4,allsides,"Two congressman — a Maryland Democrat and the Republican Chair of the Freedom Caucus — have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning “blasphemy” laws, a move cheered by religious liberty advocates.

Rep. Jamie Raskin and North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows call on more than 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy, or the renunciation of a religious belief, in House Resolution 512, which was introduced earlier this week.

Under the legislation, Congress would recognize that “blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower officials to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through the power of the government or through violence sanctioned by the government.”

Religious freedom restrictions are on the rise, according to alarming new reports from international organization’s watchdog reports.
The resolution cites some, including Russia’s ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses as an “extremist organization,” the detention of nearly a million Uighur Muslims in northwest China, and Pakistan’s use of wide-ranging blasphemy laws.

“As of May 2018, USCIRF The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom was aware of approximately 40 individuals on death row for blasphemy in Pakistan or serving life sentences,” states the resolution,” reads the resolution, which was introduced in the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

On Friday, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, a bipartisan group established by Congress, cheered the resolution, saying such laws are often weaponized to target marginalized religious communities.

“Widespread bipartisan support for this resolution will help to raise awareness of the egregious acts of persecution and violence that these laws legitimize,” said USCIRF Vice Chair Gayle Manchin, in a statement emailed to media.
“We echo the resolution’s call for all prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges to be released.”

The United Nations, through Articles 18 and 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, also uphold civil rights for religious practice and expression and are endorsed by HR 512.

Currently, the President and the Secretary of State can designate countries as “countries of particular concern for religious freedom” under 1998’s federal international religious freedom act.
This resolution would add blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons for nations to be added to the list.

In its latest report from December 2018, USIRF requested that 16 nations — including Russia, Pakistan, and China — be placed on the “nation of particular concern” list.
As of Nov. 2018, only 10 of those nations have been designated as CPCs (Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan).

The resolution also notes nations that’ve taken steps to repeal blasphemy laws, including Ireland, Greece, and Canada.
Earlier this year, the Republic of Ireland passed a law repealing a 2009 statute that criminalized blasphemy.
Canada also criminalized “blasphemous libel” until 2018, though the statute had not resulted in a conviction since 1935.","Two US congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep.

The lies Trump told this week: from immigration to the safety of inner cities

Immigration

“They’ll pay back taxes, they have to pay taxes, there’s no amnesty, as such, there’s no amnesty, but we will work with them” – 24 August, to Sean Hannity, Fox News.

The lies Trump told this week: from opposing the Iraq war to San Bernardino

Last summer, Donald Trump burst into the political ring with a fiery proposal to build a “great, great wall” along the US-Mexico border – paid for by Mexico.
An ultra-hardline stance on immigration has remained at the heart of his campaign, though reporters have had a notoriously difficult time pinning him down on what he actually proposes to do to or with the estimated 11 million undocumented migrants who currently live in America.
He has suggested a “deportation force” to remove them.

“We’re rounding ’em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way.
And they’re going to be happy because they want to be legalized,” Trump told CBS last September.
“And, by the way, I know it doesn’t sound nice.
But not everything is nice.”

On Saturday, after meeting with his Hispanic advisory council, reports emerged that the Republican candidate was softening his stance.
The next day, newly installed campaign manager Kellyanne Conway appeared to waffle on whether Trump was still committed to deportation.
In an interview with Fox News, Trump himself denied that he was “flip-flopping”.
To gain more time to fine-tune, the campaign postponed a speech he was due to give on Thursday.

On Wednesday, Trump said immigrants not in the US legally would not get citizenship – but also appeared to offer a path a forward and to contradict his previous promises that undocumented migrants would be deported.

“They’ll pay back taxes, they have to pay taxes, there’s no amnesty, as such, there’s no amnesty, but we work with them,” Trump said in a town hall with Fox News anchor Sean Hannity.
The next morning, he met African American and Latino activists at Trump Tower in New York.

War zones are safer than America’s inner cities

“The Democrats have failed completely in the inner cities.
For those hurting the most who have been failed and failed by their politicians – year after year, failure after failure, worse numbers after worse numbers.
Poverty. Rejection. Horrible education. No housing, no homes, no ownership. Crime at levels that nobody’s seen.
You can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it’s safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats.
And I ask you this, I ask you this – crime, all of the problems – to the African Americans, who I employ so many, so many people, to the Hispanics, tremendous people: what the hell do you have to lose?” – 22 August, speech, Akron, Ohio

There’s a lot to unpack in this statement.
At best, Trump is offering a broad-brush portrait of America’s cities and at worst he’s using language that is offensive to the very voters he’s trying to reach.

Trump also claims crime is at “levels that nobody’s seen”.
Based on the context and past statements about crime statistics, we can assume he means crime is at record heights.
But this bleak picture of crime-ridden American streets more dangerous than parts of the world where the US is engaged in military action, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, runs counter to a trend of declining crime that has persisted for more than a quarter of a century.

The lies Trump told this week: from Obama and Isis to support for vets

Though crime statistics are notoriously ripe for manipulation, studies show a steady decline since 1991.
Particular demographics, particularly low-income areas, do continue to show high rates of criminal activity.

Trump also claims to employ “so many, so many” African Americans in his various businesses.
However, a June analysis by the Associated Press found “few if any” black executives in the upper echelon of Trump’s organization.

Trump has recently dialed up his outreach to African American voters, but he delivers his speeches before largely white audiences.
A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed Trump receiving the support of only 1% of African American voters.

African American unemployment

“Look at how much African American communities are suffering from Democratic control … 58% of your youth is unemployed, what the hell do you have to lose?” – 19 August, Dimondale, Michigan

Trump and his campaign raised eyebrows when they repeated this eye-popping statistic: that more than half of young black men and women are unemployed.

The latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) put the unemployment rate among 16- to 19-year-old black Americans at 25.7%, adjusted seasonally.
So how did he get to 58%?

The campaign’s economic adviser, David Malpass, told ABC News it began with BLS data from 2015 and broke out the numbers for 16- to 24-year-old African Americans.
As part of its calculation, the campaign included labor force participants and those outside the labor force, including people who have no job or are not looking for one, such as students and retirees.
These are sectors of the population the federal government does not count as unemployed.

The campaign then divided the larger number by the population of the 16-to-24 age group to reach 58.5%, ABC reported.
Economists have said it is statistically misleading to include segments of the population that are actively not seeking employment.","Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a key issue in his campaign, and is now trying to court non-white voters.

allsides_immigration_c_4,allsides,"The Trump administration is considering an order to block the entry of migrants at the southern border, using the same authority as its earlier travel ban, a person familiar with the matter said, as thousands of Central Americans make their way toward the U.S.

The action, if implemented, would effectively bar those seeking asylum from entering the country.
President Donald Trump is weighing a range of options designed to prevent undocumented migrants from crossing the U.S.-Mexican frontier, said a White House official familiar with the discussions.
Both people spoke on condition of anonymity as no final decision has been made.

The travel ban, announced shortly after Trump took office in 2017, affected people from seven countries, five of them with Muslim majorities.
The executive order now being looked at would deny asylum claims based on national security concerns, and would give broad authority to officials at the border, the person said.

The New York Times reported late Thursday that the administration was considering an order that would bar migrants, including those requesting asylum, who try to enter the country from Mexico, a significant escalation of presidential power on immigration policy.

Midterm Elections

The White House official wouldn’t confirm the Times report and others, saying that several legal, executive and legislative remedies were on the table.

Trump has made undocumented immigration a front-burner issue in the weeks before the midterm congressional elections on Nov. 6.
He’s blamed Democrats for the so-called caravan of Central American migrants headed through Mexico after starting off in Honduras.

“Every time you see a Caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our Country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats,” Trump said Oct. 22 on Twitter, one of three tweets this week referencing the caravan.

Trump also claimed that “ unknown Middle Easterners” were blended in with the thousands of Central Americans, but later said that there was no evidence to support that assertion.

The Trump administration plans to send at least 800 additional troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a third person familiar with the deliberations.

The Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security confirmed late Friday plans for U.S. Northern Command to send more troops to the border, without saying how many.

In a joint statement, the departments said soldiers will help with planning, engineering support -- such as “temporary barriers, barricades, and fencing” -- and support for Custom and Border Protection agents including providing them with aircraft, medical teams, temporary housing and protective equipment.

Where Now for Migrant Caravan as Trump Tweets Threats: QuickTake

The president has also threatened to cut off U.S. aid to three Central American countries -- Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador -- over the migrants heading toward the U.S.

‘Racism-Driven Cruelty’

The Times article, citing sources it didn’t identify, said that details of the possible executive order were still in the planning stages and that whatever emerged was sure to be met with legal challenges.

Officials at the National Immigration Law Center, which participated in the earlier legal challenge to Trump’s travel ban, said it is prepared to fight a new order if Trump moves ahead.
Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the center, said that the White House’s consideration of such action shows that Trump’s “racism-driven cruelty has no bounds.”

“We will use every tool to stop Trump from undermining the Constitution and international laws and from instituting his administration’s agenda to impose a Latin ban in any form,” Hincapie said in a statement.

American Civil Liberties Union immigration rights director Omar Jadwat said it was “disgraceful” that the administration “would even consider what’s being reported.”

‘Moral Failure’

“It would mean refusing to protect people who can prove they are fleeing persecution,” Jadwat said in a statement.
“That would be a huge moral failure and any plan along these lines will be subject to intense legal scrutiny.”

But Peter Spiro, an immigration law professor at Temple University, said that courts could uphold the president’s potential actions.
In June, a sharply divided Supreme Court upheld Trump’s ban on travel from the seven countries.
The restrictions indefinitely bar more than 150 million people from entering the U.S.

“Most experts would agree about the restrictions now being contemplated: they make no sense from a policy perspective,” Spiro said.
“But just because a ban on asylum applicants would be stupid and cruel doesn’t mean the Supreme Court would strike it down.”

The troops that Trump is sending to the border would join 2,100 National Guard troops who were previously deployed to perform support duties for Department of Homeland Security personnel.

Trump said on Twitter on Thursday that he was “bringing out the military for this National Emergency” and promised immigrants unlawfully crossing the border “will be stopped!”

Earlier: Trump Gambles With Immigration Attack to Spur Midterm Voters

Cutting aid to the Central American countries is complicated.
Much of the money for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras was appropriated by Congress in the form of anti-corruption and good-governance programs.
Those initiatives have broad support from lawmakers, who’ve already promised to put up a fight should Trump try to make good on his threat.

The migrants began crossing into southern Mexico on Oct. 20, avoiding that country’s migration authorities and federal police by jumping off the border bridge crossing the Suchiate River, or by crossing the river in improvised rafts made of tires and boards, according to images from El Financiero Bloomberg TV.

Under standard U.S. procedures, the migrants, assuming they reached and attempted to cross the U.S. border, would be detained for not having the required documents, and asked whether they’re afraid of returning to their home.

A person who answered “no” would not be admitted into the U.S. One who expressed fear of persecution or torture would be interviewed by an asylum officer to establish whether there is credible fear of persecution.

Michael J. Bars, a spokesman for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in an email that the “extremely low bar” for establishing credible fear allows economic migrants to abuse the system by posing as asylum seekers, then disappear before their court dates to live illegally in the U.S.","The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from entering the US at the southern border, citing national security concerns.

allsides_coronavirus_r_4,allsides,"Protestors in Kentucky hung an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside of the state capitol during a demonstration Sunday.

The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was meant to “celebrate freedom and to fight back against the unconstitutional shutdown over the coronavirus,” according to a Facebook post.
The around-100 people present began by celebrating the Second Amendment, but the rally eventually turned into a call against coronavirus restrictions.

Protestors marched to the governor’s house shouting “Come out Andy,” according to videos posted on Twitter.
They later returned to the state capitol, where “several people” participated in hanging the effigy from a tree, the Courier Journal’s Sarah Ladd reported.

The effigy had a picture of Beshear’s face on it and a message that read “sic temper tyrannies,” a Latin phrase that translates to “thus always to tyrants.” The effigy was taken down shortly afterwards, according to the Courier Journal.

The protestor’s actions caused swift backlash from members of both parties.

Senate Majority Leader and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell condemned the effigy in a statement posted on Twitter Sunday evening.
McConnell said that while he supports the First Amendment, the actions demonstrated at the protest went too far.

@SenateMajLdr: “As a strong defender of the First Amendment, I believe Americans have the right to peacefully protest.
However, today’s action toward Governor Beshear is unacceptable.

“This is disgusting and I condemn it wholeheartedly.
The words of John Wilkes Booth have no place in the Party of Lincoln,” Republican Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Kentucky Michael G. Adams tweeted.

Many others condemned the protestor’s effigy hanging, the Courier Journal reported.

“On Memorial Day weekend, as we honor those who gave their lives for our country, & think of the small sacrifices we make to protect our community from a pandemic, we must condemn this vile act.

allsides_violence_in_america_l_3,allsides,"CHICAGO (AP) — One of the most violent years in Chicago history ended with a sobering tally: 762 homicides, the most in two decades in the city and more than New York and Los Angeles combined.

The nation's third largest city also saw 1,100 more shooting incidents last year than it did in 2015, according to data released Sunday by the Chicago Police Department.
The statistics underline a story of bloodshed that has put Chicago at the center of a national dialogue about gun violence.

The numbers are staggering, even for those who followed the steady news accounts of weekends ending with dozens of shootings and monthly death tolls that hadn't been seen in years.
The increase in homicides compared to 2015, when 485 were reported, is the largest spike in 60 years.

Police and city officials have lamented the flood of illegal guns into the city, and the crime statistics appeared to support their claims: Police recovered 8,300 illegal guns in 2016, a 20 percent increase from the previous year.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said during a news conference Sunday that Chicago is among many U.S. cities that have seen a spike in violence, including in attacks on police.
He said anger at police, including in the wake of video released that showed a white Chicago officer shooting a black teenager 16 times, has left criminals ""emboldened"" to violent crimes.

He also said it's becoming clearer to criminals that they have little to fear from the criminal justice system.

""In Chicago, we just don't have a deterrent to pick up a gun,"" he said.
""Any time a guy stealing a loaf of bread spends more time pre-trial in jail than a gun offender, something is wrong.""

Johnson, who has for months complained about Illinois' lax gun laws, said he thinks more and more gang members are arming themselves because the price for being caught is small compared to other large cities.
He said gang members he has spoken to consider the court system ""a joke.""

The bulk of the deaths and shooting incidents, which jumped from 2,426 in 2015 to 3,550 last year, occurred in only five of the city's 22 police districts on the city's South and West sides, all poor and predominantly black areas where gangs are most active.

Police said the shootings in those areas generally weren't random, with more than 80 percent of the victims having previously been identified by police as more susceptible because of their gang ties or past arrests.

The city has scrambled to address the violence.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced last year that 1,000 officers would be added to the police department.
At the same time, police officials have been trying to figure out why homicides and shootings — which began climbing the year before — suddenly surged.

On Sunday, Johnson said he hoped several initiatives — including more street cameras in some of the city's most dangerous neighborhoods, and the expansion of gunshot-detection systems — would lead to more arrests and drive down the violent crime rate.

Johnson has said several factors have contributed to the increased violence.
He noted 2016 was the first full year since the city was forced in November 2015 to release video of the fatal police shooting of Laquan McDonald, the black 17-year-old boy who was shot 16 times by a white police officer.

The video cost former Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy his job, sparked major protests around the city, and led to federal and state investigations of the police department.

It also left Johnson with the task of trying to restore public trust in what appeared to be a weakened police force, a perception that was only buttressed by a dramatic drop in the number of arrests in 2016.

The police department has cited several factors for the declining numbers, including a concerted effort not to make minor drug arrests and focus on gun violence.
Johnson pointed to gun arrests and gun seizures as evidence that his officers are aggressively fighting crime.

But critics said they have no doubt that officers have become far more reluctant to do their jobs since the McDonald video was released and the officer who killed the teen was charged with murder.

""It's almost like a pull back so they (gangs) can kill each other sort of thing,"" said the Rev.
Marshall Hatch, a prominent minister in one of Chicago's most dangerous neighborhoods on the West Side.

Johnson acknowledged in a recent interview with The Associated Press that officers have become more cautious — in part out of fear of becoming the next ""viral video.""
He also said a state law that took effect last January requiring officers to fill out lengthy contact cards when they stop someone has resulted in fewer stops, because the cards require more paperwork for officers and the cards are ""scrutinized"" by federal judges.

He said those concerns are not lost on criminals.

""Criminals watch TV, pay attention to the media,"" he said.
""They see an opportunity to commit nefarious activity.""","Chicago ended 2016 with a record 762 homicides, the most in two decades, and a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered by police.

Trump and his GOP allies have seized on the revelation, claiming it exonerates Trump and attacking Schiff and other Democrats who described what they viewed as evidence of collusion over the course of Mueller’s 22-month probe.

The president earlier in a tweet on Thursday called for Schiff's resignation from Congress.

“Congressman Adam Schiff, who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking, should be forced to resign from Congress!” Trump said.

Schiff has said he plans to move forward with the panel’s sprawling investigation into Trump’s links to Russia, financial and otherwise, and allegations the president could be potentially “compromised” by the Kremlin or another foreign power.

Thursday’s hearing was another dramatic flashpoint for the House Intelligence Committee, a panel that has been well-known for its partisan divisions that exploded into plain sight during the committee’s first GOP-led probe into Russian election interference.

Republicans abruptly ended that probe in spring of last year, despite accusations from Democrats that they did so prematurely.

After Schiff claimed the committee gavel following the November midterm elections, he revived and expanded the committee’s investigation into Russian meddling.

Other Republican members of the committee interrupted Thursday’s hearing, which was supposed to be focused on expert testimony on Russian President Vladimir Putin, to voice their dissatisfaction with Schiff.

Rep. Michael Turner (R-Ohio) at one point likened Schiff to Joseph McCarthy, the Wisconsin senator who gained notoriety for promoting investigations into alleged communists in the U.S. government that made up part of the Red Scare in the 1940s and 1950s.

allsides_elections_c_5,allsides,"Sandy Underscores Debate Over Government's Role

President Obama offered thoughts and prayers Tuesday for all those who have been affected by Sandy.
He also offered something more tangible: the full resources of the federal government.

""The most important message I have for them is that America's with you,"" he said.
""We are standing behind you, and we are going to do everything we can to help you get back on your feet.""

For Obama, the federal government is a critical vehicle for that kind of help.
Republicans put more faith in local government, and even voluntary efforts.

On Tuesday in Ohio, Mitt Romney sponsored a canned food drive for storm victims and told a parable about the virtue of individual action.
When he was in high school, Romney said, a small group of students managed the big task of cleaning up a trash-strewn football field, after each student was given responsibility for scouring one small section.

""And if everybody cleans their lane, why, we'll be able to get the job done,"" he said.
""And so today we're cleaning one lane, if you will.
We're able to gather some goods for some people that are in our lane.
We're going to help them.""

Romney did not suggest that this kind of voluntary effort alone is a substitute for the government.
But during a Republican primary debate last year, he did argue that disaster relief should be as decentralized as possible.

""Every time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states, that's the right direction,"" he said at the time.
""And if you can go even further and send it back to the private sector, that's even better.""

State disaster officials have sometimes clashed with the federal government, though that's been less of a problem in recent years.
Unlike his predecessor, President George W. Bush, Obama named a disaster professional to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

FEMA director Craig Fugate understands the states' perspective — he used to run Florida's emergency agency.
Obama has promised to keep red tape from getting in the way of recovery.

""I told the mayors and the governors if they're getting 'no' for an answer somewhere in the federal government, they can call me personally at the White House,"" the president said.

So far, the federal government seems to be delivering.
Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey had nothing but praise for the federal response when he spoke Tuesday on Good Morning America.

""I have to say, the administration — the president himself and FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate have been outstanding with us so far,"" Christie said.
""And I want to thank the president personally for his personal attention to this.""

New Jersey and most of the states hit hard by the storm were already reliably Democratic in the presidential race, but that's not true of disasters generally.
Texas leads the nation in federal disaster declarations, with deep-red Oklahoma not far behind.

Even so, for Republicans bent on reducing federal spending, the FEMA budget remains an attractive target.
When Romney was asked directly during that same GOP debate last year whether disaster relief should be on the chopping block, here's what he said:

""We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do?
And those things we've got to stop doing.
Because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in.
We cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids.""

That's an inconvenient comment in light of this week's storm.
Romney ignored reporters' questions about FEMA funding at Tuesday's canned food drive.

President Obama will continue to make the case for an active federal role Wednesday, not at a campaign rally but by touring hard-hit New Jersey.","President Obama has pledged the full resources of the federal government to help those affected by Hurricane Sandy, emphasizing the importance of government aid in times of crisis. In contrast, Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have historically advocated for a more decentralized approach to disaster relief, relying on local governments and voluntary efforts.

The debate highlights the moral imperative of government assistance in times of disaster, with Obama's approach emphasizing the importance of collective help and Romney's approach prioritizing individual responsibility.","President Obama offered ""thoughts and prayers"" to those affected by Sandy, promising the full resources of the federal government to ""help"" them get back on their feet. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney put more faith in local government and voluntary efforts, citing the virtue of individual action. Romney's past comments, however, have suggested that disaster relief should be decentralized, and that FEMA funding could be cut to reduce borrowing and avoid ""jeopardizing"" the future. Despite this, Republican Gov. Chris Christie praised the federal response, thanking the president for his ""personal attention"" to the crisis. As Obama continues to make the case for an active federal role, Romney's stance on FEMA funding remains an inconvenient truth. The president's commitment to ""delivering"" relief and ""cleaning"" up the mess left by Sandy stands in stark contrast to Romney's emphasis on individual action and fiscal responsibility."

What’s happening

Using ground-penetrating radar, scientists in Tulsa, Okla., recently discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre there.
Like much of the evidence of the deadly event, the history of what’s been called “the single worst incident of racial violence in American history” has been buried.

In the early 1920s, the Greenwood District of Tulsa, home to most of the city’s black population, was a vibrant neighborhood that was so successful, it was known as ""Black Wall Street.""
All that changed on May 31, 1921.
An unproven accusation of an assault of a white woman by a black man caused long-bubbling white resentment to boil over into violence.
White mobs flooded into Greenwood, looting homes, burning businesses and killing residents.

By June 1, 35 city blocks had been burned to the ground and thousands were left homeless.
The official count tallied 36 deaths, but historians now believe the number could have been as high as 300.

Despite the scale of violence, the Tulsa race massacre has been a largely forgotten part of U.S. history.
Many Americans said they first became aware of the incident this year, when the HBO drama “Watchmen” featured a fictionalized reenactment in its premiere episode.

Why there’s debate

A common explanation for the massacre being largely unknown is that the people of Tulsa have been hesitant to talk about it.
""For decades it was hush-hush,"" a local photojournalist said.
Law enforcement and insurance companies mostly declined to act in the aftermath of the attack, leaving little paper trail.
There was also a widespread effort to strip the historical record of evidence of the event.

For decades, the event was known as the Tulsa race riot, a title seen by many as a euphemism that minimized the true impact of the rampage.
Some historians believe the incident to be one of several that took place during a period of widespread racial violence after the Civil War — often omitted because it runs counter to the preferred narrative of black progress in America from slavery through the civil rights movement.

What’s next

Scientists say further examination of the possible mass grave sites is necessary before they can be excavated.
If bodies are found at the sites, DNA tests would be done to determine their identities.
Local leaders hope to have the project completed in time for the 100th anniversary of the event in 2021.

A feature film about the massacre and two television series about the massacre — including one produced by Oprah Winfrey — are in development, but no release dates have been announced for the projects.

Perspectives

For decades, the massacre was mislabeled as a riot

“The word ‘riot’ suggested something uncontrolled and mindless, rather than the very specific targeting of black success.
Further, by flipping victim and perpetrator, these accounts both blamed black Tulsans and absolved the white mob.” — Alaina E. Roberts, Washington Post

The massacre is better known in the black community

“The bombing of Black Wall Street is common knowledge to a large percentage of black folks … but apparently it’s news to a lot of people who prefer a whitewashed, sanitized version of American history.” — Michael Harriot, the Root

A systematic effort to erase the event from history was largely successful

“The dead were tossed into the Arkansas River and unmarked mass graves.
News accounts were cut out of the Tulsa Tribune before they were assembled into bound reference volumes.
The incident was not a part of the Oklahoma public schools’ curriculum until 2000, and only recently entered American-history textbooks.” — Frank Rich, Vulture

The massacre contradicts the popular narrative of black progress in America

“Tulsa’s massacre happened in a time that we don’t talk about.
It upends the history lessons that Americans pass down — that black people were passive victims from the slave ships to the ‘I Have a Dream’ speech, that white violence was the unique dogma of church-bombing extremists.
Black Wall Street scrambles the accepted timeline so much that it’s easier to forget the place ever existed.” — Victor Luckerson, the Ringer","Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma have discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a largely forgotten event in US history.

allsides_race_and_racism_r_4,allsides,"FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — A white police officer who killed a black woman inside her Texas home while responding to a neighbor’s call about an open front door “didn’t have time to perceive a threat” before he opened fire, an attorney for the woman’s family said.

“You didn’t hear the officer shout, ‘Gun, gun, gun,’” attorney Lee Merritt said after viewing video taken from a Fort Worth officer’s bodycam during Saturday’s shooting of Atatiana Jefferson, 28.
“He didn’t have time to perceive a threat.
That’s murder.”

Her family told KXAS television that Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew when she was killed early Saturday.

The Fort Worth Police Department said in a statement that officers saw someone near a window inside the home and that one of them drew his duty weapon and fired after “perceiving a threat.” The video released by police shows two officers searching the home from the outside with flashlights before one shouts, “Put your hands up, show me your hands.” One shot is then fired through a window.

“It’s another one of those situations where the people that are supposed to protect us are actually not here to protect us,” said Jefferson’s sister, Amber Carr.

“You know, you want to see justice, but justice don’t bring my sister back,” Carr said.

An aunt, Venitta Body, said the family does not understand why Jefferson was killed.

“It’s like from the moment we got the call, it’s been more and more inconceivable and more confusing.
And there has nothing been done in order to take away that confusion,” Body said.

Police Lt. Brandon O’Neil said Sunday that the officer, who’s been on the force since April 2018, is on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation and will be interviewed about the fatal shooting on Monday.
His name was not released.

At a brief news conference at police headquarters, O’Neil confirmed that the officer did not announce he was police before he fired the fatal shot and that his failure to do so is part of the department’s investigation.

O’Neil also confirmed that Jefferson’s 8-year-old nephew was in the room with Jefferson when she was shot.
He said representatives of the police department have spoken with the woman’s family and “shared our serious and heartfelt concern for this unspeakable loss.” Her family has said she was watching her nephew at the time.

O’Neil declined to answer reporters’ questions and said Fort Worth Police Chief Ed Kraus plans to conduct a more in-depth news conference on Monday.

James Smith, who called a police non-emergency number about the open door, told reporters he was just trying to be a good neighbor.

“I’m shaken.
I’m mad.
I’m upset.
And I feel it’s partly my fault,” Smith said.
“If I had never dialed the police department, she’d still be alive.”

Smith said Jefferson and her nephew typically lived with an older woman, who’s been in the hospital.

“It makes you not want to call the police department,” he said.

In an audio recording of Smith’s call that was released by police, the neighbor said it was “not normal” for the house to leave its front door open for hours at that time of day.

Merritt said Jefferson’s family expects “a thorough and expedient investigation.”

The Fort Worth Police Department said it released bodycam footage soon after the shooting to provide transparency, but that any “camera footage inside the residence” could not be distributed due to state law.
However, the bodycam video released to media included blurred still frames showing a gun inside a bedroom at the home.
It’s unclear if the firearm was found near the woman, and police have not said that the officer who shot her thought she had a gun.
The police statement released Saturday said only that officers who entered the residence after the shooting found a firearm.
Police did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Sunday.

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday called on the Justice Department to investigate.

“The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end,” Sanders tweeted.
“Atatiana Jefferson should be alive.”

The shooting comes less than two weeks after a white former Dallas police officer was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted of murder in the fatal shooting of her black neighbor inside his own apartment.
Amber Guyger, 31, said during her trial that mistook Botham Jean’s apartment for her own, which was one floor below Jean’s.
Merritt also represents Jean’s family.","A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, shot and killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door.
