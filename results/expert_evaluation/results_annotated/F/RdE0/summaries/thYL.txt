President Trump is close to selecting a new FBI director, with former Democratic senator Joseph I. Lieberman as a finalist. However, some staff members are urging Trump to take more time to make the decision, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. Lieberman, 75, would be an atypical choice to lead the FBI, which values its independence. Other candidates include Adam S. Lee, Richard A. McFeely, and Andrew G. McCabe, all with experience within the agency. Trump has praised Lieberman, saying they had good chemistry, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions believes he would receive overwhelming Senate support. However, Democrats are pushing back, citing Lieberman's conservative views and past support for Trump's national security adviser. The White House remains divided, with some officials expressing doubts about Lieberman's age and potential conflict of interest.
