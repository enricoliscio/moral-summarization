The plight of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay has sparked debate among editorial writers and pundits. The Ottawa Citizen argues that even thugs deserve humane treatment, and Canada should insist the US allow a competent tribunal to decide the legal status of detainees, as required by the Geneva Convention. This would ensure that laws keep us from behaving like them. The Sudbury Star agrees, while The Daily Press in Timmins disagrees, citing concerns that treating prisoners humanely might imperil American lives.

Meanwhile, Brian Tobin's sudden departure from politics has been met with criticism, with many accusing him of betrayal. Columnists have ridiculed his assertion that he left for family reasons, and have described him as flighty, opportunistic, and lacking commitment. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised as a sensible, serious, and honest leader who has proven himself to be trustworthy.
