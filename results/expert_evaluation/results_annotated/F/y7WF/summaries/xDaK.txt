The editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa have been weighing in on the recent Cabinet shuffle and the departure of Brian Tobin. The general consensus is that Tobin's "antics" and "betrayal" of voters warrant no sympathy. His sudden departure from politics has been met with criticism, with many calling him "flighty," "opportunistic," and "lacking" in commitment to his job.

Meanwhile, the plight of al-Qaeda fighters imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay has sparked debate. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue that even "thugs" deserve humane treatment and that Canada should insist the US allow a "competent tribunal" to decide the legal status of the detainees. However, The Daily Press in Timmins disagrees, suggesting that treating the prisoners differently could "imperil" American lives.

In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised as a "sensible" and "scrupulously honest" leader who Canadians can trust.
