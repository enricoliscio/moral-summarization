The editorial writers in Ottawa have been discussing the plight of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, with some arguing that they deserve humane treatment and a fair tribunal to determine their legal status, as required by the Geneva Convention. Others, however, believe that the U.S. treatment of the prisoners is justified and that critics are overreacting. Meanwhile, former politician Brian Tobin has been criticized for his sudden departure from politics, with many labeling him as "flighty," "opportunistic," and "lacking in commitment." In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised as "sensible," "serious," "competent," and "scrupulously honest." The moral tone of the editorials is clear: laws and humane treatment are essential, and politicians should be trustworthy and committed to their duties.
