President Trump announced that he is close to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss the position. Despite being a late addition to Trump's short list, Lieberman has become the sudden frontrunner. Trump also met with other candidates, including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating. Lieberman's law enforcement experience stems from his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general. Notably, Lieberman "never changed" parties, despite becoming an independent after losing the Democratic primary in 2006. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey "intriguing," while others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, believe it would be a "mistake." Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, thinks Lieberman could get 100 votes in the Senate.
