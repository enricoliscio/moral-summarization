A former U.S. serviceman, Devin Kelley, who had a troubled past, committed the deadliest mass shooting on record in Texas, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. Kelley had a history of domestic violence, having been convicted of assaulting his first wife and stepson, and had escaped from a mental hospital in 2012. Despite his criminal record, he was able to purchase guns due to an appalling lapse by the Air Force, which failed to enter his conviction into a government database. Kelley's behavior was marked by turbulence, and he had sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law. The massacre has reignited the debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter reviews of gun purchases.
