The Texas church shooter, Devin Kelley, had a troubled past, including a court-martial conviction for domestic violence and a history of mental disorders. In 2012, he escaped from a mental hospital while facing charges, and was later caught and convicted. Despite this, he was able to purchase guns due to the Air Force's failure to enter his conviction into a government database. This lapse allowed Kelley to pass background checks and buy the semi-automatic rifle used in the massacre. The tragedy has sparked outrage and calls for stricter gun laws, with some lawmakers planning to introduce legislation to block domestic violence offenders from buying guns. The case has also raised questions about the effectiveness of background checks and the need for improved reporting of criminal records. The shooting, which killed 26 people, including an unborn child, has reignited the debate over gun ownership and the need for stricter regulations.
