Tokyo is irked by the US stance on the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to slow global warming. The protocol's effectiveness is in doubt after President George Bush said the US will not ratify it. This decision is seen as a unilateralist move, ignoring the concerns of other nations. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, is particularly upset, feeling that the US is turning its back on the protocol and the framework convention on climate change. The US alternative plan, Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, is seen as a way to continue increasing gas emissions, which could lead to a two-tier system where the US and a few others set their own targets, while the rest of the world follows stricter Kyoto limits. Japan's industry is not entirely opposed to the US alternative, but many are concerned that it will hurt Japanese industrial competitiveness. The decision is seen as part of a growing trend of the US acting first and consulting later, causing tension in US-Japanese relations.
