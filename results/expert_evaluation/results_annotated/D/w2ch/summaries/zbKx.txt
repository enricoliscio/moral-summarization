Tokyo is irked by the US stance on the Kyoto Protocol, with many considering it "inadmissible" for the US to turn its back on the accord. The US decision not to ratify the protocol has sparked "indignation" in Japan, with environmental groups accusing the US of being "unilateralist" and going against the global effort to combat climate change. The US alternative plan is seen as a weaker approach that will allow the country to continue increasing its gas emissions, causing "fear" that smaller nations may back out of the Kyoto Protocol. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, takes pride in having shaped the accord and is disappointed by the US decision. The clash over global warming occurs at an awkward point in US-Japanese relations, with some seeing the US as taking a "do-it-our-way" approach that may lead to a two-tier system.
