The US stance on the Kyoto Protocol has sparked outrage in Tokyo, with environmental groups and government officials alike condemning President George Bush's decision not to ratify the accord. The move is seen as a "turn" against the global community, particularly in Japan, where the protocol was shaped and signed in 1997. The consequences of global warming, including the death of coral reefs and polar bears, are dire, and experts warn that the US decision will hinder efforts to slow the process. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, feels betrayed by the US "do-it-our-way" approach, which is seen as a "clash" between environmental concerns and economic interests. The US alternative plan is criticized for allowing the country to increase its gas emissions, which could lead to a two-tier system where smaller nations follow suit. In Japan, there is an air of indignation, with many feeling that the US is "pulling" out of its international obligations and "labeling" its own rules.
