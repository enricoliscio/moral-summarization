President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions, but Republicans were quick to blame him for the domestic terrorism. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the killing appeared to be terrorism, citing the "evil" of jihadists, and demanded the White House acknowledge the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism. The FBI identified the gunman as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, who shot and killed the four Marines before being killed himself. Authorities are treating the shooting as an "act of domestic terrorism." The attack has reignited debates over guns at military facilities and the threat of terrorism, with some lawmakers calling for a change in policy to allow troops to be armed. The incident is part of a growing trend, with federal authorities charging 62 people with planning attacks on behalf of the Islamic State or trying to provide material support to the terror group. The threat from the Islamic State is growing, with many young men and foreign-born individuals involved in terror plots or attacks.
