The House Intelligence Committee's hearing on Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential election turned into a bitter confrontation, with Republicans demanding the resignation of Chairman Adam Schiff and accusing him of being "immoral", "unethical", and "unpatriotic". Schiff refused to step down, citing the need to investigate President Trump's campaign's conduct with Moscow, which he deemed "immoral", "unethical", and "corrupt". The committee's Republicans, on the other hand, embraced Attorney General William Barr's summary of the Mueller report, which they saw as absolving Trump of wrongdoing. The hearing laid bare the deep divide in Congress, with Democrats determined to uncover the truth and Republicans accusing them of trying to ruin Trump's presidency. The episode highlighted the contrast between the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, with the latter continuing its Russia investigation in a more bipartisan manner.
