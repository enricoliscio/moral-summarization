The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since Robert Mueller's report was marked by acrimony and bitter divide. Republicans demanded Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "McCarthyism" and promoting false information. Schiff refused, citing immoral and unethical conduct by President Trump's campaign, including attempts to establish secret back channels with Russians and lying to the FBI. Democrats backed Schiff, saying they won't let go of the troubling pattern of wrongdoing by Trump and his administration. Republicans, who have embraced Mueller's findings as absolution for Trump, are enraged, accusing Democrats of trying to ruin the presidency. The committee's investigation will continue, with Schiff determined to uncover evidence of foreign compromise. The episode contrasts with the Senate Intelligence Committee's more bipartisan approach to its own Russia investigation.
