G427-zyne,"G427 preserves trans community's emotional response to Ms. Berman's death by quoting Davina,  Olivia and the community's attitudes such as ""As Olivia Nuamah, executive director of Pride Toronto, noted, ""For many in the trans community,  sadly,  violence is a part of life."" All of this is missing in zyne.",G427-quote preservation,zyne-quote omission
G427-2lc0,"Even though G427 omits the fact that ""Ms. Berman's death is the third case in recent years"" compared to 2lc0,  it preserves trans community's emotional responses to Ms. Berman's death by quoting Davina,  Olivia and the community's attitudes such as ""As Olivia Nuamah, executive director of Pride Toronto, noted, ""For many in the trans community,  sadly,  violence is a part of life.""

G427-3Jsh,"G427 directly quotes trans community's response while 3Jsh rephrase it into a less expressive way.  Besides, G427 highlights the social effect of Berman's death beyond community's level and calls for more support as reflected in ""The incident is a stark reminder of....the need for greater vigilance and support."",  while 3Jsh failed to capture the advocacy part.",G427-quote preservation,3Jsh-quote omission
G427-QzBN,"Despite the fact that QzBN is richer in facts by providing evidence like ""Many trans people do not report these assaults to the police, and 24% have been harassed by police."" to highlight the vulnerability of trans group,  the phrasing about Berman's death is too emotional compared to G427 and the original article with the usage of words like ""brutally and hearbreaking irony"".  In other words,  while G427 preserves the moral frame of original article, QzBN is suspected to over-emphasize it.",G427-moral framing alignment,QzBN-moral framing addition
