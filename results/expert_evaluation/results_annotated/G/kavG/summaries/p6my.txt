Rep. Michele Bachmann has refused to comment on Newsweek's cover story, which features an unflattering photo of her and labels her "The Queen of Rage". The National Organization for Women (NOW) has criticized the cover, calling it "sexist" and arguing that a similar depiction would not be used for a male candidate. NOW President Terry O'Neill said the cover is an example of "misogynistic attacks" that could deter women from running for office. Bachmann has not commented on the cover, but others have come to her defense, including Brent Bozell, who accused Newsweek of "journalistic dishonesty" and advised conservatives to avoid the magazine. Newsweek has defended the photo, saying it was one of several similar images taken of Bachmann.
