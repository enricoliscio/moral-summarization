The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and intolerance. The resolution accuses the Tea Party of attempting to "push our country back to the pre-civil rights era" and criticizes its tolerance of bigoted statements, including racism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia. The NAACP cites an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Tea Party members deny the allegations, claiming the NAACP is playing the "race card" and engaging in partisan attacks. The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted a counter-resolution condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "partisan" attack. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate its membership and the community about the dangers of the Tea Party movement, which could become "more dangerous" for certain individuals. The debate highlights the ongoing struggle against racism and oppression in the United States.
