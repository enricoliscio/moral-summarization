The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning the "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement, calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry and intolerance. The resolution accuses the Tea Party of tolerating racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry, citing an incident in March where protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous emphasized that the organization takes no issue with the Tea Party's freedom of assembly, but rather with their tolerance for bigotry. Tea Party members have denied allegations of racism, calling the NAACP's move a political ploy. In response, the St. Louis Tea Party drafted a resolution condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "partisan" attack, accusing the organization of abandoning black America and morphing into a political entity. The NAACP's resolution aims to educate its membership and the community about the dangers of the Tea Party's racist elements, which could become more dangerous if left unchecked.
