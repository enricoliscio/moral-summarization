Former President Obama condemned President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and "lacking basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no threat" and "are not taking away anything from the rest of us," emphasizing that they want to "serve" and "contribute" to the country. He questioned the moral implications of targeting these young people, asking "What if our kid's science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer? Where are we supposed to send her?" Obama framed the decision as a "moral question," stating that it's not required legally, but a political choice that "threatens the future" of innocent young people. He emphasized that kicking them out won't benefit the country, but rather harm the very people who "help" and "serve" their communities. Obama's passionate plea urged Americans to consider the moral consequences of this decision.
