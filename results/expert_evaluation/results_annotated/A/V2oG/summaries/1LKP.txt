The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the resurgence of force and weapon in international relations, undermining human rights. Despite numerous documents and international agreements, human rights continue to be violated, with discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention persisting. The IHRC called for the prohibition of such violations and the honoring of human rights, including political rights, women's rights, and the rights of associations. The statement regretted that the provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been materialized, resulting in heavy human losses. The IHRC condemned the injustice against the Palestinian nation and the violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, and religious minorities. The commission urged statesmen to respect human rights, citing religious teachings, and warned that peace and security cannot be established without honoring human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors, denouncing targeted killings.
