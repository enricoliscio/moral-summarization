The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the return of force and weapon dominance in international relations, undermining human rights. Despite numerous documents and international agreements promoting human rights, the IHRC lamented that provisions have not been materialized. The commission called for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, and the honoring of human rights, including political rights, women's rights, and the rights of associations. The IHRC deplored the injustice against the Palestinian nation and the violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, and religious minorities. The statement urged statesmen to heed religious teachings calling for respect for human rights, emphasizing that no peace can be established without honoring human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks and targeted killings.
