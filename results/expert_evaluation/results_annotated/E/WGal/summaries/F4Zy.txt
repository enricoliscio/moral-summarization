Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have uncovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a largely forgotten part of U.S. history. The massacre, which occurred in the Greenwood District, a vibrant neighborhood known as "Black Wall Street," was sparked by an unproven accusation of a black man assaulting a white woman. White mobs flooded the area, looting homes, burning businesses, and killing residents, leaving thousands homeless and an estimated 36 to 300 deaths. The event was subsequently buried, with law enforcement and insurance companies declining to act, and a widespread effort to strip the historical record of evidence. The massacre was mislabeled as a "riot," minimizing its true impact and blaming black Tulsans while absolving the white mob. The discovery of the mass graves is a crucial step in uncovering the truth about this violent incident, which contradicts the popular narrative of black progress in America.
