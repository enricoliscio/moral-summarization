igsI-azYM,"Same score, but for polar opposite reasons. igls fails to fully engage with the historical framing of the original article, whereas azYM goes a bit too far and adds a line on the importance of learning from history that is not there in the original ",igls-moral framing loss,azYM-moral framing addition
igsI-cHTm,"cHTm completely misses the framing of the article as reporting first and foremost on a scientific discovery. While it reflects the article's framing of black American history better than igsl, cHTm's failure to engage with the scientific dimension makes the story lose some its framing. Moreover, cHTm is writen in a confusing way (e.g. ""it contradicts the narrative"" without clearly signaling who the subject of the sentence is). ",igls-moral framing loss,cHTm-moral framing loss
igsl-ESBV,"ESBV is much better at putting forward all the elements of the text and presenting them in the same way as the original text. For instance, both summaries end on a reflection of the discovery's significance that is not quite in the text per se, but ESBV does a better job at bringing up the specificity of the event within Black history and memory, whereas igsl does not really engage with that aspect of the article. ",ESBV-moral framing alignment,igsl-moral framing loss
igsl-F4Zy,"Pretty much the same as igsl-ESBV. F4Zy is better at accurately representing the moral framing of the Tulsa Massacre as a crucial event in Black history that was systemically erased due to racism. While igsl brings up the racist reasons of the massacre, it does not connect it to the systemic erasure of the Black American experience. ",F4Zy-moral framing alignment,igsl-moral framing loss

ESBV-F4Zy,"F4Zy is marginally better than ESBV to engage with the full moral framing of the article. In particular, F4Zy teases better the relationship between the discovery, the memory-holing of Tulsa, and the false narrative about black progress.
