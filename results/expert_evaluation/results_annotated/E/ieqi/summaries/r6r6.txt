Zimbabweans are bracing for potential violence after the country's presidential election this weekend. Many fear that the loser and their supporters will not accept the results, leading to unrest. Surveys show challenger Morgan Tsvangirai ahead of incumbent Robert Mugabe, but a surge in political violence and allegations of election rigging have raised concerns. Senior government officials and military leaders have stated they will not allow Tsvangirai to take power, with some even suggesting a coup if necessary. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, mostly Tsvangirai supporters. The government has been accused of human rights violations and has put the military on high alert. Many Zimbabweans see the election as a contest between Mugabe's desire to remain in power and the opposition's desire for change. The outcome is uncertain, with some predicting violence regardless of who wins.
