George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has been revealed as a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, sparking speculation that he wore a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos lied to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, and his cooperation could be a significant development in the case. The White House has downplayed the revelations, claiming Papadopoulos played a small part in the campaign and that there was no collusion with the Russian government. However, legal analysts suggest that Papadopoulos' cooperation may have involved secretly recording conversations with Trump associates, which could be a "very, very big deal" in the investigation.
