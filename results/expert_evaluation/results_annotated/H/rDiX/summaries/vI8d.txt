A protest in Kentucky turned ugly when demonstrators hung an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, sparking widespread condemnation from both parties. The rally, meant to "celebrate freedom and fight back" against coronavirus restrictions, took a dark turn when around 100 people marched to the governor's house, shouting "Come out Andy." The effigy, bearing a picture of Beshear's face and the message "sic temper tyrannies" (meaning "thus always to tyrants"), was eventually taken down. The act was deemed "unacceptable" and "disgusting" by lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who condemned the "hate" displayed. Others, like Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, called it a "vile act" that undermined the sacrifices made to protect the community from the pandemic. The incident was widely rebuked, with many emphasizing the importance of peaceful protest and respect for authority.
