Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He claimed the US seeks to "subjugate the entire world community" and labels countries that resist its hegemony as human rights violators. Gul accused the US of having "no respect" for religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, and rules, and of being the "most fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist country" that has committed "barbarities" against innocent people. He pointed to the US's silence on Indian Muslims' killings and Israel's rights abuses in Palestine, while condemning countries that resist its influence. Gul urged Muslims to forge unity and resist US influence, warning that if they remain indifferent, they will be "crushed one by one." He advocated for a "concerted moral resistance" against US-led imperialist forces.
