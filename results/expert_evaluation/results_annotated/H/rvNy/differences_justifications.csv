UitI-G45g,"UitI takes a stronger stance by labeling critics as ""misguided"" and calling certain policies ""impractical and irresponsible,"" making its argument more forceful. It also emphasizes the contribution of immigrants to job creation and highlights the inefficiency of deportation policies. G45g, on the other hand, uses slightly softer language, referring to critics as ""misinformed"" rather than ""misguided"" and focusing on factual comparisons, such as how much immigrants contribute to Medicare versus what they receive. It also presents the crime rate argument more explicitly, stating that native-born citizens are more likely to commit crimes. While both argue for the benefits of immigration, UitI has a more urgent and opinionated tone, while G45g is more measured and fact-driven.",UitI-moral framing addition, G45g-moral framing loss
UitI-NCXE,"UitI presents a balanced and factual argument, avoiding direct confrontation while making a case for immigrants' contributions to America. It uses neutral language and statistical evidence to counter anti-immigrant rhetoric. NCXE, on the other hand, adopts a more confrontational and persuasive tone, using quotation marks to challenge opposing viewpoints (e.g., ""greatness,"" ""truth,"" ""abuse,"" ""danger""). It explicitly calls out Donald Trumpï¿½s rhetoric, making the argument feel more politically charged. Additionally, NCXE emphasizes economic contributions with stronger language, such as ""surplus"" and ""billions of dollars,"" reinforcing the argument with a more forceful and assertive stance.",UitI-moral framing alignment, NCXE-moral framing addition
