Immigrants are the backbone of America's "greatness." Despite Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, the "truth" is that immigrants have built and sustained the country. They bring specialized skills and have founded many profitable companies, including Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses were founded by immigrants or their offspring. These businesses generate millions of jobs and billions of dollars in goods annually. Critics who claim immigrants "abuse" social programs are misguided, as undocumented immigrants actually contribute to a "surplus" in Medicare. The real "danger" to native-born citizens is the bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process, which incentivizes unlawful alternatives. Instead of disparaging immigrants, lawmakers should welcome them and recognize their role in making America "great" again.
