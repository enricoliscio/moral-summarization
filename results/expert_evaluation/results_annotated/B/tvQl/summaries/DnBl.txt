Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent comments about Donald Trump's presidency have raised questions about her propriety and the court's integrity. Ginsburg's candor about her concerns has led some legal academics to suggest that she might have to recuse herself from considering any Trump-related case that reaches the high court. Critics argue that her comments have crossed a line, creating the appearance of bias and impartiality. Under federal law, justices must step aside from cases where their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. While Ginsburg's comments are seen as beyond the pale by some, others argue that the political process has done away with the veneer that the high court is entirely apolitical. Perhaps, the pretense that judges are nonpartisan and apolitical does more harm than good.
