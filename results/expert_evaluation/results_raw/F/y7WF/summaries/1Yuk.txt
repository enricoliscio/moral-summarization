The editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa have been weighing in on the departure of Brian Tobin from politics and the plight of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. While Tobin's sudden departure has been met with criticism and ridicule, with many calling him "flighty" and "opportunistic", the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners has sparked a moral debate. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue that the prisoners deserve humane treatment and a fair tribunal to determine their legal status, as required by the Geneva Convention. In contrast, The Daily Press in Timmins supports the US treatment of the prisoners, citing concerns for American lives. Meanwhile, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised for his competence and honesty. The moral framing of the article emphasizes the importance of upholding human rights and the rule of law, even in the face of conflict and terrorism.
