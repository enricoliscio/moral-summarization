President Trump is close to choosing a new FBI director, with Joseph I. Lieberman, a former Democratic senator, as a finalist. However, some staff members are urging Trump to take more time, citing Lieberman's lack of federal law enforcement experience. Trump has emphasized the need for a "great" director to restore the FBI's "special" reputation, which was damaged during the campaign. Lieberman's bipartisan reputation could lend credibility to Trump, but his age and potential conflict of interest are raising concerns. Other candidates, including current FBI officials and judges, are still being considered. Trump's decision is being closely watched, with some Democrats pushing back against Lieberman's nomination. The president's choice will have significant implications for the FBI's morale and reputation.
