Democrats' election-year measure to ensure women don't face pay discrimination was blocked by Republicans, who claimed the bill would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. The bill, which needed 60 votes, got only 52, with no Republican support. President Obama criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." The bill aimed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, requiring employers to prove pay differences weren't gender-based, allowing employees to share salary info, and enabling women to sue for damages. Republicans argued they opposed pay discrimination but disagreed with the Democrats' bill, which they said was written without their input. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring the measure back until it passes.
