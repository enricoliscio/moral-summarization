A former US serviceman, Devin Kelley, who committed the deadliest mass shooting on record in Texas, had a history of violence and behavioral problems. In 2012, he escaped from a mental hospital while facing court-martial on domestic violence charges, after being caught sneaking firearms onto a US Air Force base. He was later convicted of assaulting his first wife and stepson. Despite this, he was able to purchase guns twice in the past year, due to an "appalling" lapse by the Air Force in failing to enter his conviction into a government database. On Sunday, Kelley stormed into a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and opened fire on worshipers, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. He killed himself after being wounded by an armed civilian. The massacre has reignited the debate over gun ownership and background checks, with lawmakers calling for stricter reviews to prevent such tragedies.
