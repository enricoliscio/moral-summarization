Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman, committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. Kelley had a troubled past, having been convicted of domestic violence and assaulting his first wife and stepson. He had also been caught sneaking firearms onto a U.S. Air Force base and had made death threats against his military commanders. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns twice in the past year due to the Air Force's failure to enter his conviction into a government database. This lapse has been called "appalling" by a Republican congressman. Kelley's behavior problems started early, with nine suspensions in school for issues like drugs, insubordination, and dishonesty. His private life was also marked by turbulence, including a domestic dispute with his in-laws that involved threatening text messages. The massacre has reignited the debate over gun ownership and stricter reviews of gun purchases.
