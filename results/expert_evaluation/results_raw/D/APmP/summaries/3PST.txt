President Trump announced that he is close to naming a new FBI director to replace James Comey, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the position. Trump confirmed that Lieberman is the leading contender, despite being a late addition to the short list. Lieberman has law enforcement experience from his time as Connecticut's attorney general and has a bipartisan background, having served as both a Democrat and an independent in the Senate. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey "intriguing," while others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, believe it would be a "mistake." Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn thinks Lieberman could get 100 votes in the Senate. Trump also met with other candidates, including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating.
