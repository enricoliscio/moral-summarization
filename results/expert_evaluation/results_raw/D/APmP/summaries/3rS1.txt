President Trump is "very close" to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman emerging as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss leading the law enforcement agency. Trump confirmed that Lieberman is the frontrunner, despite being a "late and somewhat unlikely addition" to the shortlist. Lieberman's law enforcement experience stems from his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general. However, his political history has raised eyebrows, having angered Democrats in the past by endorsing John McCain over Barack Obama and later supporting Hillary Clinton against Trump. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey "intriguing", while others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, believe it would be a "mistake". Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn notes that Lieberman could potentially get 100 votes in the Senate. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argues against a "career politician" of either party leading the FBI.
