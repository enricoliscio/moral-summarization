President Trump is "very close" to naming a new FBI director, with former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman as the leading contender. Lieberman, 75, met with Trump at the White House to discuss leading the law enforcement agency. Trump confirmed that Lieberman is the frontrunner, despite being a somewhat unlikely and sudden addition to the short list. Lieberman's law enforcement experience stems from his tenure as Connecticut's attorney general. Some Republican senators find the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey "intriguing", while others, like Sen. Claire McCaskill, consider it a "mistake". Lieberman's past has also angered Democrats, who may be concerned about his ability to lead the FBI impartially. Despite this, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn believes Lieberman could get 100 votes in the Senate.
