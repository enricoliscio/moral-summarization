The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, claiming that their pro-life ordinances violate the rights of pro-abortion groups to free expression and association. The ACLU argues that the ordinances, which would outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, mislead residents and hinder abortion providers from operating and speaking within city limits. The lawsuit contends that the ordinances unconstitutionally punish pro-abortion organizations and violate the First Amendment. In contrast, pro-life advocates, such as Mark Dickson, believe the ordinances are constitutional and necessary to protect unborn life, and are prepared to defend them at no cost to the cities. The ACLU's lawsuit is seen as an attempt to intimidate cities from enacting similar ordinances.
