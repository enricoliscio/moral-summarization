The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing that their pro-life ordinances mislead residents and violate the rights of pro-abortion groups to free expression and association. The ordinances, which would outlaw abortion within city limits if Roe v. Wade is overturned, dub abortion providers and pro-abortion entities as "criminal organizations," prohibiting them from operating, speaking, and associating within these cities. This, the ACLU claims, hampers their ability to counter and clarify the confusion created by the ordinances as to the legality of abortion services. The ACLU argues that these ordinances are unconstitutional, as cities cannot punish pro-abortion organizations for carrying out their work, especially when it violates the First Amendment. In contrast, pro-life advocates, such as Mark Dickson, believe the ordinances are entirely constitutional and consistent with Texas laws, and are prepared to defend them at no charge to the cities.
