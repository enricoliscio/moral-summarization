The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, violating the rights of pro-abortion groups to free expression and association. The ordinances in question mislead residents by suggesting that abortion would be outlawed if Roe v. Wade is overturned, and designate abortion providers as "criminal organizations," prohibiting them from operating, speaking, and associating within city limits. This unconstitutional move hampers the groups' ability to counter or clarify the confusion created by the ordinances. The ACLU argues that cities cannot punish pro-abortion organizations for carrying out their work, especially when it violates the First Amendment. In contrast, the director of Right to Life East Texas, Mark Dickson, claims the lawsuit is meritless and intended to deter and intimidate cities from enacting these ordinances, which he believes are entirely constitutional and consistent with Texas law. Dickson's organization is prepared to defend the ordinances at no charge to the cities.
