0drF-DnBl,"Both 0drF and DnBl present moral frames in the article (namely, the judge was wrong; maybe the whole concept of impartiality is bad). However, 0drF missed in reporting some of the importance of the second moral framework, that while in the article has less space, it is conveyed with more rhetorical sentences (e.g., 'So perhaps the pretense that judges are nonpartisan and apolitical does more harm than good.'). On the contrary, by reporting those sentences, DnBl maintains the proper equilibrium between the two."

0drF-Z80O,"Z80O and 0drF present both frameworks, but if in 0drF the two frameworks are sequential (F1 and F2); in Z80O, it undermines the framework 2 narrative as after presenting it, it repeats framework 1 (F1, F2, and F1 (again)), thus undermining the validity of the framework 2 narrative."

Both X and DnBl present moral frames in the article (namely, the judge was wrong; maybe the whole concept of impartiality is bad). However, X missed in reporting some of the importance of the second moral framework, that while in the article has less space, it is conveyed with more rhetorical sentences (e.g., 'So perhaps the pretense that judges are nonpartisan and apolitical does more harm than good.'). On the contrary, by reporting those sentences, DnBl maintains the proper equilibrium between the two.
