Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a dark chapter in American history that has been largely forgotten. The massacre, which occurred in the thriving Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was sparked by an unproven accusation of assault and resulted in the deaths of up to 300 people and the destruction of 35 city blocks. The event was subsequently erased from history through a systematic effort to strip the historical record of evidence, with law enforcement and insurance companies declining to act and news accounts being cut out of reference volumes. The massacre contradicts the popular narrative of black progress in America, revealing a period of widespread racial violence after the Civil War. Local leaders hope to excavate the mass grave sites and complete the project by the 100th anniversary of the event in 2021. The discovery serves as a reminder of the importance of confronting and learning from the past.
