r6r6-uhB4,"r6r6 preserves really the moral framing, whereas uhB4 indulges in a bit more sensationalism, for instance by explicitely linking political violence to the election. This is suggested in the original article, but not openly affirmed"
r6r6-Ks0D,"similar to r6r6-uhB4, r6r6 is better at keeping the moral framing both in terms of pro-Tsvangirai storytelling and signaling objectivity. Ks0D is more openly pro-Tsavangirai, which hinders the aspiration to objectivity that characterises the text "

Ks0D-Wzaz,"Wzaz is better at keeping the objectivity of the text, and doesn't do editorialising that is not present in the original article. While it lacks some clarity, it's still closer to the moral framing that Ks0D, which is more sensationalist  "
