In Zimbabwe, fears of violence and unrest are growing as the country prepares for elections this weekend. Many believe that neither the ruling party nor the opposition is prepared to accept the outcome, leading to concerns of a civil war. The government has been accused of numerous human rights violations and rigging the election. Senior officials have made intolerable pronouncements, threatening a coup if the opposition wins. The opposition, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is ahead in surveys, but the government's desperate attempts to remain in power may lead to unrest and violence. The election has been marred by corruption, food shortages, and unemployment, and many fear that the outcome will be stolen. The opposition has vowed not to prosecute President Robert Mugabe if they win, but the government's last-ditch efforts to stay in power may lead to further unrest.
