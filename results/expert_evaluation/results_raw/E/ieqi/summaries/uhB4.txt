As Zimbabweans prepare to vote in the upcoming election, many fear violence and unrest regardless of the outcome. The challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, is ahead of incumbent Robert Mugabe in surveys, but Mugabe's supporters have threatened to reject the results if he loses. Senior government officials and military leaders have stated they will not allow Tsvangirai to lead the country, with one even suggesting they would support a coup. The election has been marred by political violence, with at least 34 people killed, mostly supporters of Tsvangirai's party. Mugabe's government has been accused of human rights violations and rigging the vote. Many Zimbabweans see the election as a contest between an autocrat desperate to remain in power and an opposition party fighting against government corruption and oppression. The outcome is uncertain, but one thing is clear: the risk of violence and unrest is high.
