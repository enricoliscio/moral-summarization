pmHt-2P86,"pmHt loses the speculative tone of the text and presents everything as factual. 2P86 is in the other extreme, it keeps the speculative framing, but adds that this represents ""a blow for the Trump campaign"", which is not said in the original article "
pmHt-RCn9,"pmHT loses the speculative tone by favouring a more factual approach, whereas RCn9 fully indulges in the sensationalist speculation of the text"
pmHt - K6NL,"pmHt loses the speculative framing but it largely reflects the content of the article. K6NL is more faithful to the tone of the article, but adds extra layers of framing (e.g. ""uncover the truth""; ""potentially uncovering evidence of money laundering and conspiracy"") which makes it ever more sensationalist"
pmHt - eE90,"Very similar texts, the main difference for me is that eE90 puts forward the speculations in the first line (""sparking speculation that he wore a wire to help prosecutors""), therefore conditioning the reader for the rest of the paragraph. pmHt, on the other hand, does it in the last (""he news has sparked speculation about the extent""), which lends a more factual tone to the whole. "
2P86 - RCn9,"Very similar texts, but RCn9 sticks to the speculation present in the text, whereas 2P86 further editorialises by describing the situation as a ""blow for the Trump campaign"", which is not said in the original article. "
2P86 - K6NL,"Both texts add editorialising layers, but K6NL goes further by saying stuff like ""uncover the truth"" or suggesting that this is connected to the accussations of money laundry"
2P86 - eE90,2P86 leans  further into the speculation and/or editorialising aspect of the text whereas eE90 presents it as a more factual piece of information
RCn9 - K6NL,"RCn9 faithfully represents the framing of the text and its content. K6NL keeps some of the moral framing, but it does so by adding extra layer that change the overal meaning of the revelations "
RCn9 - eE90,"RCn9 is better at keeping the sensationalist speculative tone, whereas eE90 leans into a more factual account that doesn't necessarily reflect the moral framing of the article "
K6NL - eE90,"Both texts do not keep the moral framing of the original, K6NL because it leans too much into speculation and sensationalism, eE90 because it does too little in this regard "
