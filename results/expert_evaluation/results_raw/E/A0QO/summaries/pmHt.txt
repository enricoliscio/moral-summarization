Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos has been cooperating with federal investigators as a "proactive cooperator" since his arrest in July. Court documents suggest that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Prosecutors have asked a federal judge to seal court filings in the case, citing that "premature disclosure" of his arrest would undermine his ability to cooperate. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and has been providing information to the government on request. The White House has downplayed the revelations, saying Papadopoulos played a small part in the campaign and there was no collusion with Russia. The news has sparked speculation about the extent of Papadopoulos' cooperation and whether he recorded conversations with Trump associates.
