President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans were quick to blame him, labeling the attack as domestic terrorism. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal accused Obama of failing to confront the dangers posed by "evil" jihadists, claiming that radical Islam is at war with the US. The attack reignited debates over gun policies at military facilities and the threat of terrorism, with some arguing that Obama's policies have failed to address the issue. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized US citizen, and authorities are treating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism. The attack highlights the growing threat of the Islamic State, with federal authorities charging 62 people with planning attacks on behalf of the group.
