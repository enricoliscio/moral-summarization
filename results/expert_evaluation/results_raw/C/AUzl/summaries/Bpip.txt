President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions, but Republicans were quick to blame him for the domestic terrorism. Gov. Bobby Jindal termed the killing a "grave reality" of the threat posed by "evil" jihadists, emphasizing the need for the White House to acknowledge that "radical Islam is at war with us." The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, who shot and killed the Marines before being killed himself. The attack has reignited debates over guns at military facilities and terrorism, with many calling for a change in policy. Obama asked Americans to wait for more facts, while Republicans like Jindal were quick to label the attack as terrorism. The threat from the Islamic State is growing, with federal authorities charging 62 people with planning attacks on the homeland. The attack is a reminder of the need to "counter the evil and twisted ideology" that drives vulnerable minds to violence and hate.
