The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants, including asylum seekers, from entering the US at the southern border, citing national security concerns. This move would effectively bar those seeking asylum from entering the country. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border to support Customs and Border Protection agents. Critics have condemned the proposed action as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "moral failure" that would refuse to protect people fleeing persecution. The ACLU and other organizations have vowed to fight the order in court, arguing that it would undermine the Constitution and international laws. The move is seen as a political ploy to rally Trump's base ahead of the midterm elections.
