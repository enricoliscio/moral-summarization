The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, effectively denying asylum claims and giving broad authority to border officials. This move would be a "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure" according to critics. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border, which would be a "disgraceful" and "cruel" action. The president has threatened to cut off aid to three Central American countries, which would be a "threat" to the region. The proposed order would be met with legal challenges, with critics arguing it would be a "moral failure" to refuse to protect people fleeing persecution. The administration's actions are seen as an attempt to "undermine" the Constitution and international laws. The move would be a "ban" on asylum seekers, which would be a "cruel" and "stupid" policy.
