The House Intelligence Committee's first hearing since the Mueller report's release was marked by acrimony and bitter divisions. Republicans demanded Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of promoting false information and undermining faith in US government institutions. Schiff refused, citing concerns about President Trump's campaign's conduct with Moscow, which he deemed "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." Democrats backed Schiff, praising his work as chairman, while Republicans accused him of chasing after Russian collusion. The hearing laid bare the deep divide in Congress, with Democrats determined to investigate Trump's wrongdoing and Republicans embracing Mueller's findings as absolution. The episode contrasted with the Senate Intelligence Committee's more bipartisan and low-key approach to its own Russia investigation. As the House committee's work continues, Schiff's determination to uncover the truth about Trump's campaign's dealings with Russia remains unwavering.
