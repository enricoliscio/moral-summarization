Former President Obama strongly condemned President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and lacking "basic decency". Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no threat" and "are not taking away anything from the rest of us", emphasizing that they want to contribute to the country by starting businesses, serving in the military, and more. He questioned the morality of targeting these young people, who have done nothing wrong, and deporting them to a country they may not know or remember. Obama framed the decision as a "moral question", urging that it is wrong to threaten the future of these innocent individuals. He also highlighted that ending DACA won't improve unemployment rates, taxes, or wages. Obama's criticism is a moral rebuke, emphasizing that the decision is "contrary to our spirit" and "common sense".
