The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the return to a period where force and weapons dominate international relations. Despite numerous documents and agreements, human rights are still violated, and the IHRC called for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention. The statement regretted that the provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been materialized, leading to heavy human losses and devastating wars. The IHRC deplored the injustice against the Palestinian nation and violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, and religious minorities. The commission urged statesmen to heed religious teachings calling for respect for human rights, emphasizing that no peace will be established without honoring human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow in international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks and targeted killing of Palestinians.
