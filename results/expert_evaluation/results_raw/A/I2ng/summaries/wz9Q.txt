The NAACP has adopted a resolution condemning "racist elements" within the Tea Party movement and calling on its leaders to repudiate bigotry. The resolution urges the Tea Party to accept responsibility for tolerating racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry. NAACP leaders cited an incident in March where Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers. However, Tea Party members have denied the allegations and accused the NAACP of playing the "race card" and being "irrelevant" and "partisan". The St. Louis Tea Party has drafted a counter-resolution condemning the NAACP for its "bigoted" and "inflammatory" attack. The debate highlights the deepening divide between the two groups, with the NAACP accusing the Tea Party of promoting "racist" and "bigoted" ideologies, and the Tea Party accusing the NAACP of abandoning its civil rights mission.
