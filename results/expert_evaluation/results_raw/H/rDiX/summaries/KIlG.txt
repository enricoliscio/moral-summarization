Protesters in Kentucky hung an effigy of Democratic Governor Andy Beshear outside the state capitol during a demonstration on Sunday. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, aimed to "celebrate freedom" and fight against coronavirus restrictions. Around 100 people attended, marching to the governor's house and shouting "Come out Andy." The effigy, featuring Beshear's face and a Latin phrase translating to "thus always to tyrants," was later taken down. The action sparked swift backlash from both parties, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans condemning the effigy as "unacceptable" and "disgusting." Democrats, including Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and Kentucky House Democrats, also denounced the act as "vile" and "beyond reprehensible." The incident occurred on Memorial Day weekend, with many calling for unity and respect during the pandemic.
