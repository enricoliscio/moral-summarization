A disturbing protest took place in Kentucky, where around 100 people gathered to demonstrate against coronavirus restrictions. The rally, organized by Take Back Kentucky, turned ugly when protesters hung an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol. The effigy had a picture of Beshear's face and a message that read "sic temper tyrannies," a Latin phrase that translates to "thus always to tyrants." This act was widely condemned by members of both parties, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, who called it "disgusting" and "vile." The protest's actions were deemed unacceptable and hateful, especially on Memorial Day weekend. The hanging of the effigy was seen as a threat to the governor's life and a rejection of the sacrifices made to protect the community from the pandemic.
