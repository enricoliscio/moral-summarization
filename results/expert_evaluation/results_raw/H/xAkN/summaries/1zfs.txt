Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has rejected the US State Department's 2023 report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." Gul, a former director-general of the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence, believes that the report is a manifestation of the US's hegemonic designs, targeting countries that resist American influence. He accuses the US of having no respect for religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, and rules, and of being the most fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist country. Gul cites the US's actions in Afghanistan and its silence on human rights abuses in India and Palestine as examples of its hypocrisy. He urges Muslim scholars to resist US influence and Muslim rulers to forge unity to counter the US's growing power. If they don't, Gul warns that they will be crushed one by one.
