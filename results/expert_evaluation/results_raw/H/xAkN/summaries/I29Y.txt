Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has strongly rejected the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He argues that the US labels countries that resist its hegemony as human rights violators. Gul accuses the US of having no respect for religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, and rules, and of being the most fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist country. He cites the US's actions in Afghanistan and its silence on the killings of Indian Muslims and the Palestinian issue as examples of its hypocrisy. Gul believes the US wants total submission from Muslims worldwide and warns that if Muslim scholars and rulers do not unite to resist US influence, they will be crushed one by one. He advocates for a concerted moral resistance and unity among Muslim leaders to counter US hegemony.
