Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul rejects the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He argues that the US seeks to "subjugate" the world community and labels as human rights violators those who resist its "hegemonistic designs." Gul asserts that the US has no "respect" for religion, faith, or human rights, and is "fraudulent," "terrorist," and "extremist." He cites the US's silence on Indian Muslims' "brutal" murders and Israel's "worst examples of rights abuses" against Palestinians as evidence of its hypocrisy. Gul warns that the US wants "total submission" of Muslims worldwide and urges Muslim scholars to mount a "concerted moral resistance" against US influence. He advises Muslim rulers to "forge unity" to resist US dominance, lest they be "targeted one by one." Gul's scathing critique accuses the US of "barbarities," "oppression," and "killings," and demands that Muslims defend themselves against their "oppressors."
