Immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. They have not only built but sustained the country, introducing specialized skills and founding profitable companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses can trace their beginnings to immigrants. These businesses have produced millions of jobs and services, selling $857 billion in goods annually and employing almost 4 million workers. Critics ignore these facts, instead arguing that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs like Medicare, when in reality, they pay $13.8 billion more into it than they receive. Moreover, native-born residents receive $30.9 billion more than they contribute, resulting in a deficit. The true danger is not immigrants, but the unnecessarily bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process, which incentivizes unlawful alternatives. It's time to welcome immigrants, who come to the US for freedom and opportunity, rather than disparage them.
