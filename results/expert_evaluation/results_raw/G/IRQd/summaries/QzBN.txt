Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was brutally murdered on December 22, 2019. In a heartbreaking irony, she had spoken out against transphobia and violence at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017, where she shared the story of a trans friend who was murdered. Her own murder is a stark reminder of the high rates of violence faced by the trans community. According to a 2015 study, 20% of Ontario's trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted, and 34% have been verbally threatened or harassed. Many trans people do not report these assaults to the police, and 24% have been harassed by police. The trans community is left vulnerable, with three violent deaths in Toronto in the past couple of years. The incident is an alarming reminder of the need for greater support and action against transphobia and violence.
