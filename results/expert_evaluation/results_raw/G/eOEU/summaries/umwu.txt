Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of the Religious Freedom Reformation Act on Thursday, a day after refusing to sign an earlier version due to concerns about discrimination against LGBT individuals. The revised bill mirrors the federal RFRA and removes provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. Similarly, Indiana lawmakers made changes to their controversial RFRA, explicitly stating that the law does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The changes come after immense national backlash, with many politicians, business leaders, and celebrities speaking out against the bills. Hutchinson faced pressure from his son, who asked him to veto the initial bill, as well as from Walmart, which is headquartered in Arkansas and called for the bill's veto, citing concerns about undermining the spirit of inclusion.
