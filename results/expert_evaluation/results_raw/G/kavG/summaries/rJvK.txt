Rep. Michele Bachmann has declined to comment on Newsweek's cover story, which features an unflattering photo of her and labels her "The Queen of Rage." However, others are calling out the magazine for its sexist depiction of the presidential candidate. The National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill argues that the cover is misogynistic and reduces Bachmann to a "nut job." O'Neill applies a simple test: would the magazine do the same to a man? The answer is no, and therefore, the cover is sexist. NOW defends Bachmann, despite disagreeing with her on almost every issue, because they want women to run for office without facing such attacks. Others, like Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center, condemn the magazine's journalistic dishonesty and suggest conservatives should steer away from such venues, demanding editorial oversight. Newsweek has defended the photo, but the controversy highlights the need for fairness and respect in media representation.
