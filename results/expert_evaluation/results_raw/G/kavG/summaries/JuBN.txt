Rep. Michele Bachmann, a presidential candidate, has been featured on the cover of Newsweek magazine with an unflattering photo and the title "The Queen of Rage". The National Organization for Women (NOW) President Terry O'Neill has called the cover "sexist" and "misogynistic", arguing that the magazine would not use a similar title for a male candidate. O'Neill believes that the cover is intended to portray Bachmann as a "nut job" or "crazy", and that it is an attack on her as a woman. Bachmann has declined to comment on the cover. NOW and other groups are defending Bachmann against these attacks, arguing that they are unfair and will discourage women from running for office. Critics also accuse Newsweek of "journalistic dishonesty" in its treatment of conservatives.
